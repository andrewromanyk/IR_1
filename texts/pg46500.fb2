<p><strong>Preface</strong></p>
<p>This story is written more or less on the same lines as
my previous story of naval adventures—<emphasis>Mr. Midshipman
Glover, R.M.</emphasis>—and describes events subsequent to those
narrated in that book.</p>
<p>The proof sheets have been carefully read by messmates
of different branches of the Service, and I am much
indebted to them for correcting many technical errors.</p>
<p>Practically all the characters are drawn from life, and
the cruisers and gunboats, British, American, and Chinese,
taking part in the various operations are actual ships
under altered names.</p>
<p>I therefore hope that the story gives an accurate
representation of life in the Service under the war conditions
described.</p>

<p>Old Gurridge—Appointed to the Vigilant—Dick sends a
Telegram—The Vigilant at Last!—"Dear Little Dicky!"—Dicky
gives his Messages</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>I don't expect that you have ever heard of Upton Overy,
in North Devon, but it is there where Captain Lester, of
the Royal Navy, lives, and, at any rate, you must have
heard of him.  Everyone in the West Country knows him
by name and most of them by sight, and whenever he
comes back from sea the villagers won't do any work,
and the bellringers ring peals and "changes" on the old
church bells all day long, till you'd think that the top
stones must be shaken off.  The noise always makes my
mother's head ache terribly.  You see, my father is the
parson of Upton Overy, and our house is so close to
the church, that the noise seems to go through and
through it.</p>
<p>If he happened to be at home, on leave or on half-pay,
the Captain sometimes asked my father to go out shooting
with him, and when I was quite a kiddy I was so fearfully
keen to go too, that once I crept away and followed them.
My father would have sent me back, had not the Captain
growled out—and he had an awfully deep growling voice—"Let
the nipper come along o' us, Padré;" and you may
be jolly well certain that I did follow them, keeping close
behind the Captain, without saying a word, and with my
eyes glued on him, just to see exactly what he did.  I got
so tired, that if I hadn't been afraid of making a noise
I should have cried.</p>
<p>"Send the young 'un to sea.  He'll do," he had said
when my father, very angry at having his day's sport
spoilt, had at last to carry me back.</p>
<p>That is the first I remember of Captain Lester, and is
why I remember what he said.  Afterwards he would
often let me go with him, and when I was big enough
would let me hold his great mongrel dog "Blucher".
The Captain used to take this dog to sea with him, and
always brought him out shooting; but he used to get so
excited that he would obey nobody, and if let loose, always
ranged ahead of the guns, and put up every bird for miles.
The result was that he was kept on the chain nearly all
the time.</p>
<p>Although he was so useless, the Captain would never
leave him behind.  "I've spoilt the dog taking him to
sea", he would growl; "I ain't going to spoil his bit of
sport", and he always let him have a run "on his own"
towards the end of the day.</p>
<p>Sometimes his eldest girl, Nan, used to come too, and
as she worshipped her father just as much as I did, we
became quite chums, and had many a jolly day together,
while we hung on to old Blucher's chain, and he tugged
us about.</p>
<p>She worried very much because she was a girl and
couldn't go to sea, but of course that wasn't her fault—I
told her so, often—and it always made me feel what a
jolly good thing it was to be a man, and that I was going
to sea.  I had made up my mind to that, and had never
forgotten what the Captain had said.  I simply longed for
the sea, and used to spend every moment I could down
among the fishing boats, helping to spread the nets out
along the shore to dry, and sometimes taking a hand
in mending them.  I made chums, too, of the boys in
the smaller smacks, which worked close inshore, and
one of them took me out several times in his uncle's
boat.</p>
<p>But just skirting along the coast was not enough for
me, so one night I did a very silly thing.  Upton Overy
owned six deep-sea trawlers, which were generally away
on the fishing grounds for a whole week, and one night,
I couldn't stand it any longer, and crept out of the house,
round by the back of the church, down a cliff path to
the harbour, crawled aboard one of these trawlers, and
hid myself under the nets.  I knew that they were all
going out before daylight, and that I shouldn't be found
till we were right out of sight of land.</p>
<p>When they did pull me out in the morning, old Gurridge—it
was his boat I'd crept into—was rather beastly about
it, and jawed at me till he was tired.  He'd had some row
with my father, and thought it a jolly good opportunity of
having a "dig" at him, and the way he'd brought me up;
but I didn't mind what he said—not in the least—for all
round me was sea, no land whichever way I looked, and I
simply felt mad with delight.</p>
<p>It came on to blow, too, and I don't think that old
Gurridge could have taken me back, even if he'd wanted
to—and he didn't want to either, because of that row with
my father—and all the time he made me work, scrubbing
and cleaning, and jawing at me for being so wicked as to
run away.</p>
<p>Of course I got back safely, had a jolly good beating,
and was sent to bed; but, honestly, I couldn't feel wicked,
because, right down inside me, I knew that I'd done it
because the Captain wanted me to go to sea, and, as I told
you before, I simply worshipped him.  Most people did—even
the "grown-ups"—so it was no wonder that I did.</p>
<p>He heard about it too—my trip in the trawler, I mean—and
that was one reason, I fancy, why he gave me a
nomination for the <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>, and when I had passed
in, promised to look after me if I did well there.</p>
<p>I can't help remembering the first time I came home
in cadet's uniform, and rushed up to the House to show
myself to Mrs. Lester and the girls.  Nan was most
respectful, and she'd never been so before, and that pleased
me more than anything else.  I expect that I put on a
frightful amount of "side", and must have been a horrid
little bounder.</p>
<p>I only saw Captain Lester twice whilst I was in the
<emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>, and then he commissioned the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> for the
China station.  Of course, what I really wanted to do
was to go to his ship, but I thought that probably he'd
forgotten all about me.  He hadn't, though; for when,
during my last term, my father had to write out to him
about some church repairs, he wrote in his reply, "Tell
the young 'un he can come out to my ship, if he passes
out of the <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis> well".</p>
<p>This news simply made me boil all over, and you may
guess how hard I worked that term, and what I felt
like when the lists came out.  My name—Dick
Ford—was seventh of my term, and next below me was Jim
Rawlings, my best chum, and we both had just got
enough marks to scrape out as midshipmen straight away.</p>
<p>Wasn't that splendid?  It was grand, too, to see the
little white badges sewn on the collars of our monkey
jackets, and to know that we'd finished being cadets.</p>
<p>The next thing to do was to get Captain Lester to
apply for me; but I funked asking Mrs. Lester, and my
mother stood rather in awe of her too.  However, it
turned out that the Captain and Mrs. Lester between
them had arranged it all, and one morning, after I'd gone
home on Christmas leave, there was a large blue envelope
for me in the postbag.  I tore it open, and the first
thing I saw was the name <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> scrawled in among
the print.  I yelled with delight, for there it was at
last.  It was grand, and at the end of the print was:
"You are to embark on board the P. &amp; O. Steamship
<emphasis>Marmora</emphasis> by noon on the 14th January".</p>
<p>My mother ran up to her room directly I had read it
aloud and she had looked to make certain, and my
father frowned at me and said angrily, "You see what
you've done?  Broken your mother's heart," and that made
me miserable again, though I couldn't feel miserable for
long, and rushed up to the House to show the appointment
to Nan and everyone I met.  I shall never forget that
day and the next three weeks, and at last driving off
to the station, with my sea chest on top of the village
cab, really, actually—I could hardly believe it—on my
way to China—and Captain Lester.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lester and the girls were at the big gates, and
I had to stop and wish them goodbye.  Nan looked
down her nose and pretended she wouldn't have given
her soul to be coming too, and Mrs. Lester, before I
knew what was going to happen, actually bent down
and kissed me.  My mother was so astonished that she
left off crying, but I'm almost sure that Mrs. Lester had
tears in her eyes.  Of course I knew why—because I
was off to join the Captain, and would—-with
luck—see him in six or seven weeks.</p>
<p>She had a big box of things for me to take out to
him too, and it took a great deal of hoisting up
alongside my chest.</p>
<p>You can have no idea how many messages were given
me for him.  Of course everyone in the village knew
I was going, and for the last fortnight, I should think,
half the village had sent "best respects to the Captain",
and news about their children or gardens or the fishing.
I stuck them all down in a notebook so as not to
forget them—my mother advised me to do this.  At the
station old Puddock, the station master, gave me a pot
of cranberry jam his wife had made—she'd been cook
up at the House before she married Puddock—"with
our best respects for the Cap'en, Master Dick, and tell
him we're both fair to middling, and I got first prize at
Barnton Show for the pigs".  Out came the notebook
again, and we were off at last—my mother and I.</p>
<p>But the funniest thing of all happened at the next
station—Bodington—for there Ned the Poacher—he was an awful
nuisance for miles round, and spent half the year in
prison—came sheepishly to the carriage and asked me to tell the
Captain that he and his pals wouldn't be too hard on the
pheasants this year, as they knew he was coming home for
next year's shooting.  "Tell the Cap'en they birds be
mighty strong and healthy, and there'll be plenty of 'em
next year when he comes home," and he shuffled away.
I suppose he hadn't the face to come to me at Upton
Overy itself.</p>
<p>I wasn't going to put that down in the notebook, but my
mother said I had better do so.</p>
<p>When we went down to the docks next day and went
aboard the <emphasis>Marmora</emphasis>, the very first person I saw was
Jim Rawlings—on his way out to join another cruiser—and
in the excitement of seeing him I hardly wished
my mother "goodbye" properly, and it was only when
the <emphasis>Marmora</emphasis> shoved off and left her standing alone in
the rain, on the dock wall, that I felt what an awful
brute I was, and wanted to jump across the bit of
water just to say "goodbye" once again.</p>
<p>There were four cadets on board, as well; going out to
join different ships.  A lieutenant was in charge of all of
us, and jolly nasty he made himself too; and we were all
jolly glad when we found his ship lying at Singapore, and
he cleared out.  I'm not going to tell you all about the
voyage.  It would take too long, and there are too many
exciting things for you to hear.  For me they began there,
and it was Jim who made the discovery.  He'd got hold
of a Singapore newspaper, and suddenly came flying along
the deck, whooping like a madman, and shoved it into
my hands.  You can imagine how excited I was, for
among the telegrams was this:</p>
<p>"Shanghai, February 22nd.  Captain Lester, H.M.S. <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,
senior officer in the Chusan Archipelago, reports
that the Chinese cruiser <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> has picked up Mr. Martin
P. Hobbs and his daughter, adrift in a boat, and
that their steam yacht has been captured by a gang of
pirates in possession of a large steamer, and led by a
European."</p>
<p>At the end of the telegram followed—"We understand
that Captain Lester has been ordered to take the necessary
steps to recapture Mr. Hobbs's yacht."</p>
<p>My Aunt!  Wasn't that news?  You can just fancy how
I almost felt sick all over with excitement, and how
frightfully important I felt at being the only one going to that
ship, with a chance of chasing pirates.  How I wished
it was possible for Jim to come too.  We thought and
thought of any number of schemes, and then, "Let's
telegraph to Captain Lester," he burst out; and we hunted
out every penny we had in our chests, rushed ashore,
jumped into a double rickshaw, and went off like mad to
the Eastern Telegraph Office.  The <emphasis>Marmora</emphasis> was lying at
Tanjong Pagar wharf, and we needn't have gone fifty
yards, if we'd known, but we drove right into the town.</p>
<p>When we got there our courage began to ooze away,
because I knew it was a frightfully cheeky thing to do;
but Jim bucked me up, and the telegraph people helped
us, and put the best address they could think of.  What
we sent was: "Midshipman Rawlings chum mine wants
come <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>—Ford Midshipman", and that took nearly
all our money.  Neither of us cared a "rap" about that,
though, so long as Captain Lester would ask for Jim.</p>
<p>We were half-dead with funk at what we'd done when
we got outside the office, but Jim cheered me up by
saying, "we couldn't get hanged", and that they wouldn't
send us home again, because of the expense, so we drove
back fairly happy, though I couldn't sleep much that
night for wondering whether the Captain would think
me frightfully impertinent.  He was terrible when he was
angry.</p>
<p>We were a week punching up to Hong-Kong.  It
seemed a month, and when we did get there, both Jim
and I were waiting at the gangway for the officer of the
guard to board her, hoping to hear from Captain Lester.
Of course there was nothing at all for us from him, and
I was ordered to go across to H.M.S. <emphasis>Tyne</emphasis>, store-ship, for
passage to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, whilst Jim and the three cadets
had to go aboard the <emphasis>Tamar</emphasis>, the receiving ship, always
stationed there.  Jim didn't say anything, but went down
the gangway with his lips firmly pressed together, and
I, very miserable, went across to the <emphasis>Tyne</emphasis> and wandered
about her great ward room like a lost sheep all the
afternoon, getting in everyone's way, till I got into a corner,
and wrote a long letter home.</p>
<p>I couldn't keep miserable very long, though, because we
unmoored directly after dark, and at last I was really off
to join the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and in the excitement forgot about
Jim.  Boats had kept coming and going, and I hadn't
taken any notice of them, and they must have come over
in the last boat, because just as we cast off someone
banged me on the back, and there was Jim Rawlings,
grinning all over his jolly ugly red face, and behind him
was that ass Dicky Morton, the junior of the three cadets,
with his silly little eyes almost sticking out of his head
with excitement.</p>
<p>"We're both sent to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>," he squeaked out.</p>
<p>Well, Jim coming too made me just completely happy,
although it was a bit toned down by having Dicky Morton
with us too.  "He's not a bad little chap when you get
used to him," Jim told me, but that was Jim "all over".
He was the most unselfish fellow you ever met in the
world, would have given you his last shirt if you asked
him, and was always standing by to give a leg up to
silly idiots like Dicky.</p>
<p>He hadn't the least idea why he'd been sent; he'd just
been given an order, signed by the Commodore, and he
hadn't heard whether Captain Lester had telegraphed or
not.  We tried to think that our telegram had just done
the trick, but then that did not explain why Dicky was
here.  We didn't worry about anything, though, for long,
and simply counted the minutes, and kept our eye on the
cherub log all the time.  You can imagine what we felt
like when we ran into a fog, three days out, and had to
crawl along at about five knots, rolling about in a swell
on our starboard bow.  Our navigator was much too wily
a bird to try and make the Chusan group of islands from
the south in that kind of weather, and that meant another
twelve hours steaming; but at last the fog blew away, the
sun came out long enough for him to take a sight, and
away we went again.</p>
<p>The fifth day out from Hong-Kong we made the islands—you
can bet your boots we were on deck—dodged in
between several of them, and then the harbour of Tinghai
suddenly opened out, and far away, under a hill, we could
just see a white spot.  "That's your ship, the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,"
a signalman told us as he hoisted the <emphasis>Tyne's</emphasis> number.
We got nearer and nearer; she got bigger and bigger.
Presently the signalman hauled down the pendants, and
we knew that the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> had seen us, and I wondered
whether Captain Lester would be frightfully angry or not.
I was really in a funk at meeting him, chiefly because of
that telegram.</p>
<p>We anchored quite close to her, over to us bobbed a
steamboat with a big "V" on her bows—our steamboat—my
steamboat some day perhaps—and we were presently
bundled in and taken across, the midshipman of
the boat winking at us patronizingly.</p>
<p>"Have you caught the pirates?" we all asked him.</p>
<p>"Not yet.  You bet! but we're in for some fun.  You're
lucky beggars, I can tell you.  They're only expecting one
mid.  Where the dickens d'you other two come from?"</p>
<p>The first bit made us fearfully excited, but the last part
made me miserable again; for it made it quite certain
that Captain Lester had not asked for Jim Rawlings, and
I knew he would be angry with us both if he had received
that telegram already, or if he ever did get it.  We were
alongside in a jiffy, I climbed up the ladder, and, in my
excitement at being at last on board the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, I forgot
to salute the quarterdeck, and so did Dicky, and the officer
of the watch "jumped" on us both and sent us both down
below with a flea in our ears.  I got red all over with
shame, and it hurt me more because Dicky and I were
in the same box; it wouldn't have been so bad if it had
been Jim.  The Captain was ashore—I was jolly glad of
that—and the Commander was asleep, and didn't want
to be disturbed, so we were left to ourselves, and saw
our chests lowered into the gunroom flat, jammed together
into a dark corner, and then we sat down on them for
company, swung our legs, and felt miserable.</p>
<p>We weren't left alone for long, though, and soon we
were hauled into the gunroom, where the Sub-lieutenant—a
huge, great fellow—made us stand in a row in front
of him, and asked us silly questions, to make all the others
laugh.  Jim and I got through this all right, but Dicky
made a perfect little ass of himself—we were frightfully
ashamed of him—squeaking out all sorts of things about
his family and his sisters, and everyone roared with
laughter.</p>
<p>"What do they call you at home?" the Sub asked him.</p>
<p>"Dicky, sir," the idiot bleated.</p>
<p>"Don't they ever call you 'dear little Dicky'?" the Sub
said coaxingly.  He was enjoying himself immensely, and
I could almost feel Jim grind his teeth with anger when
Dicky smiled feebly, and answered, "Sometimes, sir."</p>
<p>There were shouts of "dear little Dicky" all round the
room, and the ass never saw what an idiot he had made
of himself.  He was always called "dear little Dicky"
afterwards, by the Sub's orders, though there was no
need for orders to make them all do that.</p>
<p>It was a horribly bad beginning.</p>
<p>They hadn't any news of the pirates either to cheer us
up.  They had had one look for them, but had found
nothing, and were now waiting for fresh orders.</p>
<p>Just before it got dark someone sung out that the
Captain was coming back with the Fleet Paymaster.  I
hadn't the courage to go up on deck to let him see me,
but just peeped out of a gunroom scuttle as he came
alongside.</p>
<p>He was so broad and big, that he seemed to fill the
galley's stern sheets.  He was wearing the same stained
old shooting-suit he always wore at Upton Overy—I never
could remember seeing him in any other—Blucher, thinner
than ever, was squatting between his knees, and the
Fleet Paymaster, with white beard and a still older
shooting-suit, was sitting next to him.  He threw away
the stump of a cigar, helped Blucher scramble on to
the ladder, gave a gruff order to the coxswain, and
followed Blucher.  He looked so stern, and I felt so afraid
of him, that I popped my head in again lest he should
see me, and waited, hot and cold, expecting him to send
for me.  I wasn't so silly as to think that he would want
to see <emphasis>me</emphasis>, but I knew that he would want to hear all
about Mrs. Lester and the girls.</p>
<p>Jim knew how frightened I was, and promised that
directly I was sent for, he and Dicky would bring along
the packing-case which Mrs. Lester had sent, and put
it outside his cabin door, so that I could get at it very
quickly.</p>
<p>And then I remembered that pot of cranberry jam, and
hunted for it in my chest.  I couldn't find it anywhere.
Jim asked what I was looking for, and he helped too.
Suddenly he stopped, his face quite white.</p>
<p>"Was it a white jar with the top covered with brown
paper?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it was," I told him, and knew that something
awful was going to happen.</p>
<p>"I emptied it," he groaned; "ate the whole lot, half-way
from Aden."</p>
<p>I went cold all over, and just then the sentry sang out
that the Captain wanted me, and I shuffled aft, knocked
at the door, heard the Captain's growl "Come in!" could
hardly turn the handle for fright, went in, and stood
before him absolutely speechless.</p>
<p>He was reading a letter—we'd brought a mail with us in
the <emphasis>Tyne</emphasis>—and didn't look up for a moment or two, and
just in that time, jolly old Blucher stretched himself, came
over, smelt me, got up on his hind legs and licked my face
before I could prevent him.  I could have hugged him,
because that did the trick, and made me forget all about
the jam and the telegram—for the moment.</p>
<p>"Hello, Dick!  Got here at last?" and the Captain
looked up, and held out his great red hand.  "How's the
Missus and the girls?  Where's that box of things she
tells me she gave you?"</p>
<p>"Outside, sir," I squeaked—like Dicky—and simply
rushed out.  Jim and Dicky had just brought it along, and
I dragged it in.</p>
<p>"Umph!  Don't spoil my carpet.  Where's Willum?
Willum!" the Captain shouted, "come and open this
box."  "Willum"—I never knew his surname—was his
valet, and between us we soon had the box open, the
Captain all the time asking me questions.</p>
<p>"I had a number of messages for you, sir, from people
in Upton Overy.  I've got them all—nearly all of
them—down in my notebook."</p>
<p>"Where is it?" he growled.  "Read 'em out."</p>
<p>But I'd left it down in my chest purposely, so that I
could get a "breather", and when I ran down to get
it, Jim was waiting for me.</p>
<p>"Anything about the telegram or the jam?" he asked
anxiously.</p>
<p>"Not yet; things are going all right so far;" and I
raced back and began reading the messages, till I came
to the station master's, and then I got red and spluttered
a bit and didn't read it, but went on to Ned the Poacher's
about the pheasants.</p>
<p>"Like his darned cheek!" the Captain roared, purple
in the face.  "I'll shoot him the first time I catch him!
He knows that, and keeps clear when I'm about.  What's
become of his wife and kids?"</p>
<p>I told him, and then—I knew it must come out sooner
or later—blurted out, "and Puddock, the station master,
asked me, sir, to tell you that they were both 'fair to
middling', and 'his pigs have won first prize this year
at Barnton'.  Mrs. Puddock, sir, sent you a pot of
cranberry jam, but—but——"</p>
<p>"Where is it, Dick?  She's made me a pot every
year since I went to the <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>.  Bring it out."</p>
<p>Well, there was nothing else to be done.  I simply
quaked with fear and stuttered out: "Jim ate it,
sir—I mean we both ate it," and then, before he could say
anything, I explained that Jim Rawlings had thought it was
mine, and that it would be a good joke to eat it without
my knowing.</p>
<p>I suppose I looked so terrified that he hadn't the heart
to be angry.  He gurgled and growled and got red in the
face, and I waited to see whether it was going to be with
amusement or anger, and oh! I was so thankful, it was
only amusement.</p>
<p>He sent me away then.  "You'll shake down all right;
glad to have you in my ship;" and though I longed to ask
him whether there was any chance of going for those
pirates, I hadn't the pluck to do so, and bolted like a
rabbit.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER II</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduces Sally Hobbs</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>News of the Pirates—Mr. Hobbs Tells his Story—The
Chinese Captain—The Pirates—Three Cheers for Miss
Hobbs!—The Skipper gets the Telegram</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Commander Truscott, H.M.S. Vigilant</emphasis>.</p>
<p>As I have been asked to assist in writing an account of
the events which happened during the last few months
of the commission of our dear old tub the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, I had
better explain to you how they first arose.</p>
<p>We had been up to Shanghai, to be handy in case a
serious effervescence of native feeling against Europeans
should bubble over, and get out of the control of the local
authorities.  As it happened, the agitation fizzled out
without our being required, and I think I can honestly
say, to our great disappointment.</p>
<p>From there we steamed down to Tinghai Harbour in
Chusan, the largest of the islands of the Chusan
Archipelago, and anchored close to Joss House Hill and the
tumble-down ramparts of the new town of Tinghai.  All
the islands of the archipelago simply abound with game.
There are pheasants in every valley, and millions of duck,
geese, curlew, snipe, and even wild swan are to be found
on the marshes, paddy fields, and vast stretches of mud.
It was for this reason that Captain Lester had obtained
permission to come here, and he had chosen Tinghai
because its harbour is the safest in the archipelago, as well
as the most important, being the centre for a vast trade
carried on with Ningpo and Shanghai on the mainland.
Close inshore are always clustered a great number of
fine merchant junks, loading and unloading, and anchored
off the town is generally a small fleet of war junks.  These
are supposed to cruise round the islands and keep down
piracy—as a matter of fact they don't.  As an additional
protection to the town and shipping, two little open
batteries are built at each end of the harbour, mounting
fairly modern breech-loading guns.</p>
<p>Half a mile inland, and only connected to the modern
town by a rough causeway through the paddy fields, is
the ancient town of Tinghai.  It is surrounded by a deep
moat and lofty mud walls, which are pierced by four
gloomy archways.  These are flanked by towers, closed
in by heavy, iron-bound gates, and only approached over
drawbridges whose rusty chains are probably not equal
to the task of hauling them up.</p>
<p>It looks gloomy enough from the outside, but it is
still more so inside, and the sullen, scarcely concealed
hostility of the inhabitants of its dark, horrid-smelling
streets makes one exceedingly glad to get out again
into the daylight, with no more indignity than being
spat at or hustled.</p>
<p>The natives of the seaport town have grown accustomed
to white men, and if they do not exactly welcome them,
they tolerate them amiably enough.  Indeed, a missionary
and his wife—Macpherson by name—have lived here for
years, and are always dinning into our ears the number
of converts they have made.</p>
<p>You can imagine that everyone who could get away
shooting did so, and one evening I came back to the
ship after a long day's tramping through paddy fields
after snipe.  I had been using my new hammerless gun
for the first time, I remember, and hadn't quite got into
the "hang" of it, and kept on forgetting to push up the
"safety" catch.  Snipe don't give you much time for
fooleries of that sort, so I hadn't been very successful.</p>
<p>I noticed that a Chinese cruiser was anchored close to
the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, but paid no special attention to her, because
she often came in.  It was getting dark, and I was in
a hurry to get aboard, have a hot bath, and change for
dinner.  The skipper of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, one of our
gunboats, had been shooting with me; I put him aboard
his own packet, and then pulled alongside the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,
where Lawrence, our navigator, met me at the gangway
very excited, and I saw at once that there was
something the matter.  He followed me into my cabin, and
whilst I changed into uniform, told me what had happened.</p>
<p>The Chinese cruiser—the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> she was—an old
wooden corvette belonging to the Peiyang squadron, had
been making one of her regular cruises among the islands,
and yesterday morning she had picked up two Americans—an
old man named Hobbs and his daughter—adrift in
a boat.  They had reported that they and their steam
yacht, the <emphasis>Sally Hobbs</emphasis>, had been captured by pirates, and
that somehow they themselves had managed to escape.
Turning out of her course to search for the yacht, the
<emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> had run into a fog, and presently found
herself "right on top" of a tramp steamer and the yacht
herself.  Both had made off inshore as quickly as possible,
and the Chinese Captain, following them, had rammed
the poor old <emphasis>Huan Min's</emphasis> nose firmly into the mud.  He
had scarcely commenced to go full speed astern, when she
came under a heavy fire, either from the tramp steamer
or the shore, a fire to which she was unable to reply
with effect.  She was hulled several times, and had had
some men killed and wounded before the rising tide
enabled her to back off into deep water and get out of
range.  She had come along to Tinghai as fast as she
could, and Lawrence told me that the two Americans were
already aboard the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and that Captain Lester was
furious at having to look after them.</p>
<p>"He's had rather a bad day's shooting, sir, and is in
a bad temper."</p>
<p>This was Lawrence's story, and excited enough he was
about it and the chances of our having a "show".
"Strangely enough too, sir," he said, "the First
Lieutenant of that ship is an old chum of mine—a man named
Ching.  He was doing a year's training in the old
<emphasis>Inflexible</emphasis> when I was a Mid in her.  A jolly chap he
was—we all liked him—and he's coming over after dinner to
have a yarn, if he can get away."</p>
<p>I had to dine with the Captain that night—he positively
refused to entertain the two Americans by himself—and
I learnt from the old father, Mr. Martin P. Hobbs—I
had seen his name in the papers—he was a wealthy
railway magnate—the details of their extraordinary escape.
This is what he told me, and you can take it for what
it's worth; but he was such a weird, cunning little object,
that I, somehow or other, found myself doubting his story.
He and his daughter Sally, who was as pretty as paint,
although her hair had been clumsily cut off, and who
was now trying to twist the dear old bully of a Captain
round her little finger, had been wandering about the
Northern Treaty Ports, and at Shanghai had met some
Boston people who were, what he called, doing a "splash".
They'd been somewhere up country with a caravan of
their own—somewhere where no one else had ever been—and
in order to go one better, nothing would content Miss
Hobbs but that her father should buy a small steam
yacht, which happened to be for sale, and start away
for a thousand-mile trip up the Yangtse.  The skipper
of the yacht—they'd named it the <emphasis>Sally Hobbs</emphasis>—seems
to have been a dare-devil sort of scoundrel, according
to Hobbs, and instead of taking them up to Hankow,
got them to alter their plans, and brought them down
among the islands.</p>
<p>One night they had anchored close to an island, and
woke up to find the yacht in possession of a crowd of
Chinamen, simply swarming all over the decks.  They
were forced down below and locked in their cabins, and
there they stayed for a whole day, while the yacht
steamed away.  Some time during the next night Hobbs
was roughly gagged and bound, a long, blue, Chinese
coat pulled over him, and he was made to get into a
boat alongside.  He found his daughter lying in the
sternsheets, gagged and covered with another blue native coat.
He heard a scuffle on deck, but it was too dark to see
anything distinctly.  He thought he heard the voice of the old
Scotch engineer of the yacht, and then someone cast off
the boat and they drifted quickly away in the darkness.</p>
<p>In the morning they had been seen by the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>,
taken on board, were in great danger whilst she was
trying to fight the pirates, and were afterwards brought
along here.</p>
<p>That was his story, and as I said before, it did not
convince me.  If the whole scheme had been arranged, and he
implied that the skipper of the yacht was the arch villain,
how on earth had he allowed Hobbs to escape so easily?
He must have known of his enormous wealth, and would
surely have kept close guard on him to extort a ransom
later on.</p>
<p>However, there was his daughter, and no doubt her hair
had been roughly cropped off, and from what I know about
women, especially pretty ones, they wouldn't lose their hair
if they could possibly help it, and when I looked across at
her, the very picture of innocence, and heard her tell the
Skipper how they'd shorn it off, putting her hands through
the irregular bits left, her lips quivering, and her eyes
filling with tears, I was bound to believe that there was some
truth in it.</p>
<p>It was amusing to watch the change in the Skipper's
manner.  He had sat down to dinner with a scowl on
his face that would have melted the paint off the
bulkhead, and snarled whenever he spoke; but now he was
telling her all about his wife and daughters, and she was
holding up her wrists to show him where they had been
bound and bruised, and had completely mollified him.</p>
<p>Presently Hobbs ventured to ask him if he would try and
recapture the yacht, and then the Skipper flared up again
and roared at him, "that American citizens should get their
own ships to do their own dirty work".  The Skipper's
language was never too refined, but the little man wasn't
to be browbeaten.  "Guess the <emphasis>Sally Hobbs</emphasis> was flying
your own red ensign, Captain," he answered defiantly.</p>
<p>"Darn my rags!  Why didn't you say so before?"
shouted the Skipper, and got purple in the face.  "Those
pirates dare touch anything under our flag?  I'll go after
'em to-morrow."</p>
<p>"I rather fancy she was," put in Miss Hobbs.  "Poppa
and I were in such a hurry, we'd only time to paint <emphasis>Sally
Hobbs</emphasis> on the stern and the lifebuoys, and didn't reckon it
counted, altering the registration."</p>
<p>Well, that put matters in a new light, and I felt pleased
at the prospect of our taking a hand in the game.</p>
<p>I happened to think of Lawrence finding his chum on
board the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>, and told the Captain about the
strange coincidence.  "He's probably on board now,
sir; he was coming over after dinner, if he possibly
could."</p>
<p>"Umph!  I'd like to see him.  He would probably be
useful," growled the Skipper, and sent "Willum" for him.</p>
<p>He came in presently, a fine-looking fellow in his black
silk tunic with gold dragons round the sleeves, tall and
upright, with a determined, prize-fighting jaw, which took
the Skipper's fancy directly.</p>
<p>He sat down, couldn't keep his eyes off Miss Hobbs,
and told us the story which you know already.  He was
very bitter about everything: his guns were worn out, his
ammunition rotten, and his shells wouldn't burst, and, he
added, wincing, that they had not had sufficient medical
stores for their wounded.</p>
<p>The Skipper, who, I could see, was much attracted by
him—it was his square jaw that did it—offered to send
carpenters over to help repair damages next morning (our
doctors had already taken charge of the wounded), and
promised that he would take the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> down to
investigate the island.</p>
<p>I waited only long enough for the Skipper to make out
his orders for raising steam in the morning, and slipped
away to bed.</p>
<p>Next day we sent Hobbs and his daughter ashore—they
were to stay with the Macphersons at the Mission House—and
steamed down to the island, off which the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>
had received such a hammering.</p>
<p>Though we spent the whole day examining not only the
coast line, but the interior itself, not a trace could be found
of the existence of any pirates or any battery.  In fact, the
island appeared to be uninhabited, and we steamed back
somewhat out of patience with ourselves.</p>
<p>The next day the Taotai from the old town of Tinghai
came on board in great state, amidst the firing of
three gun salutes from the war junks and the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.
The Captain of that ship came with him, and Ching also,
to act as interpreter.  I don't quite know what their idea
was, but they imagined that the Skipper could do anything,
and they implored him to do something.  The poor, feeble
old Taotai seemed to be at his wits' end, and must have
stayed a couple of hours on board, pouring his woes into
the Skipper's extremely unsympathetic ears.  It appeared
that he was responsible for the maintenance of order
throughout the archipelago, and that piracy had lately
been increasing to an alarming extent.  From island
after island memorials and petitions had been pouring
in for the last six months, and the old man quite broke
down when he told us how impossible it was to do anything,
and how he dare not report the whole state of affairs
to his Viceroy on the mainland.</p>
<p>"Why not?" growled the Skipper, glaring at him.</p>
<p>"He'd probably be dismissed, sir, or lose his head,"
Ching answered.</p>
<p>"And a good thing too.  Umph!" the Captain muttered.
"Tell the old chap that I'm sending a gunboat up
to Shanghai to-morrow or the next day, and will report
everything to the Admiral, and must wait his orders.
It's no use me looking for that yacht by myself—might
as well look for a needle in a haystack.  Umph!"</p>
<p>What annoyed him was that the Taotai wouldn't send
out his war junks.  We didn't know the real reason for
some weeks, but the old Taotai almost cried when he said
that if the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> could be beaten off by them, the
feeble junks wouldn't stand a chance.  There was a good
deal of sense in that.</p>
<p>Of course, instances of piracy are always cropping up
among these islands—we had been long enough in Chinese
waters to know that—and we knew, too, that unless they
became very numerous in the same locality, the authorities
did not take much notice of them.  You see it was only in
times of bad trade, when perhaps the fishing had been a
failure, or when the crops had been destroyed by one of
the typhoons which used to devastate the islands lying in
its track, that the inhabitants, practically threatened with
starvation, would take to piracy as a means of tiding over
the bad time.</p>
<p>Just imagine the temptation of seeing some lumbering
great junk becalmed off your village, or stuck fast in the
mud, if everyone was hungry and desperate, and imagine
what an easy thing it was to man all your boats, surround
her, and capture her.  The chances were that she was full
up with foodstuffs, beans, or rice or fish, and there was
little to fear from the authorities, far away in Tinghai.
They would never hear of it either, if you knocked the
crew on the head.  That is practically what would happen,
and one lucky capture would set a village "up", till next
harvest enabled them to carry on their peaceable pursuits.</p>
<p>Sometimes, of course, it happened that their appetites
would be so whetted with their success, that they would
lay in wait for every favourable opportunity, and every
crawling junk which passed.  Sooner or later it would
be known that it was dangerous to take that channel,
and sooner or later, if the trouble continued, a war junk
or two, or perhaps one of the Peiyang corvettes, would
be sent there to burn the village and hang a few of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>That is what you may call the ordinary course of events,
and so long as someone did get hanged and some village
was burnt, all went smoothly, and very little notice was
taken of it.</p>
<p>But now, according to the old Taotai and Ching, it was
a very different pair of shoes.  There was organized piracy
now; pirate junks cruised in twos and threes, cutting out
junks anchored in front of their own villages, appearing
from where no one knew, disappearing as mysteriously,
but scattering death and ruin wherever they did appear.</p>
<p>A whole fleet of merchant junks, crowded together for
safety, had recently been attacked by half a dozen pirate
junks, and but one had escaped, throwing her cargo
overboard, and flying before the wind to bear the news.</p>
<p>Not only were they evidently organized, but they also
must have had spies in the principal centres, because, not
two months ago, a war junk carrying the monthly salt tax
to the mainland had been surrounded by pirates and forced
to surrender, in sight of land.  She had put up a good
fight, and was well armed—for a war junk—and not the
least notice had been taken of several merchantmen sailing
with her for protection.  This outrage was the real reason
why the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> had been sent down.</p>
<p>Merchant junks always do carry four or five small
muzzle-loading carronades, and these pop-guns had, up to now,
been generally sufficient to scare away any sea robbers.
Now, however, these gentry had got possession of such
powerful weapons, that antiquated smooth bores were
out-ranged entirely.</p>
<p>For months junks hardly dare quit an anchorage, unless
they sailed in company with others, and if a strange lateen
mat sail was sighted, would huddle together, and be only
too glad to escape by disabling one of their own number,
and leaving her a prey to their pursuer.  You can
understand the fright of these poor wretches, as they beat or
drifted through the narrow channels, burning joss-sticks
on their high poops, to implore the protection of one of
their sea gods, and scuttling down below in abject fear
when a pirate junk swooped down on them like a hawk,
showing no mercy and giving no quarter, if any resistance
was offered.</p>
<p>It was then, in this plight, that the Taotai had implored
Captain Lester to give him assistance, and you can imagine
that he was only too eager to take the matter up, especially
as the capture of the <emphasis>Sally Hobbs</emphasis> under our flag gave him
the excuse and opportunity he needed.</p>
<p>But he could do nothing till he had communicated with
the Admiral and asked for more gunboats.  This is what
he did immediately, sending despatches up to Shanghai by
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.</p>
<p>After that we had to be content to await events, and we
had to wait for nearly three weeks, as something went
wrong with the mails.</p>
<p>During this time the <emphasis>Tyne</emphasis> storeship arrived with a lot of
gear for us, as well as three youngsters.  Only one of
them—Ford—had originally been appointed to this ship,
and I was much annoyed at two more being sent, because
our gunroom was already overcrowded, and I'm always
having trouble there, Langham, the Sub, having peculiar
ideas of running the "show" with which I don't always
agree.  Hobbs and his daughter seemed to have taken up
their quarters permanently at the Mission House, and one
day, before we eventually sailed, came off to tea with
me—they'd asked themselves, and I could not well refuse—and
brought with them a German named Hoffman, one of the
finest specimens of a man I have ever seen.  He caught
the Skipper's eye immediately, and the two were soon
engaged in trying various feats of strength, at which,
as far as I can remember, the German generally won,
very much to the Captain's annoyance.  Little Miss Hobbs
bothered me till I let her go down into the gunroom to
have all the "dear little midshipmen", as she called them,
introduced to her.  She made herself so popular there, that
they sang "For she's a jolly good fellow", which made her
fly back, in double-quick time, with tears in her eyes, to
my cabin, where her father was smoking my cigars, and
spitting, most accurately (and frequently), into my fireplace.</p>
<p>Hobbs told me that Hoffman was the original owner of
the <emphasis>Sally Hobbs</emphasis>, had heard of her capture from some of
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> fellows at the Shanghai Club, and had come
across country to Ningpo, and from there to Tinghai in a
junk.  Mighty keen, too, he was to get hold of her,
because her rascally skipper, who had pretended to be his
agent, had naturally never paid over the purchase money.</p>
<p>He rather foolishly asked Captain Lester whether he
could be of any assistance to him in his search for her;
but this made the Skipper flare up and say that he hadn't
orders to do anything, and "if he did get them", he
growled, "it was time enough when 'Old Lest'", as
he always called himself, "had proved himself a blooming
fool".  I softened the Skipper's fierceness as much
as I could, for Hoffman was evidently hard "hit" by
his money loss, and, as he had lived all his life in China,
I thought that he very possibly would be of some
assistance when we really did come to business.</p>
<p>Well, at last, after we'd almost thought the Admiral
had forgotten us, the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> did arrive, and little
Rashleigh, her Lieutenant Commander, came on board, purple
in the face because he would wear his sword belt too tight,
waved some official letters at me, and went down aft.</p>
<p>It was not many minutes before I was sent for, heard
the Skipper roaring to Rashleigh to "throw away that
cabbage stalk he was smoking", and to Willum, "bring
those eighteen-penny Havanas of mine", so knew, before
I saw him, that the news was good, and found him rubbing
his hands together and grunting with pleasure.  "We've
got to go for 'em, Truscott, got to go for 'em.  The
Admiral's sending me a couple more gunboats, as well as the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and I'm to have a free hand.  We've got to get
back that yacht, and Old Lest will give 'em a lesson not to
meddle with the British flag.  Umph!"</p>
<p>As he went over his correspondence I saw him read
a telegram and turn round furiously.  "Dash my wig,
Truscott, look here, here's impertinence!  What the
dickens is the Service coming to?" and he handed it
to me.</p>
<p>I couldn't help laughing.  It read, "Midshipman Rawlings
chum mine wants come <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>—Ford Midshipman,"
and was sent from Singapore.</p>
<p>"Well, he's managed to get here somehow or other, sir."</p>
<p>"Both of 'em, drat 'em! and brought that useless
rubbish Morton with 'em too!  Umph!"</p>
<p>The Skipper was really angry, but I managed to smooth
things down.</p>
<p>"Pretty plucky thing to do, sir, and both Ford and
Rawlings are not half-bad boys.  They don't know much,
of course, but will do well."</p>
<p>"Umph!" he grunted.  "Plucky, do you call it?  I
don't.  I'll see them both presently."</p>
<p>It was lucky for them that the Admiral's letters had
brought such good news.  As a matter of fact, we fully
expected that they would, and in the meantime the
Skipper had obtained a vast amount of information from
the Taotai ashore, and had already roughly drawn out his
scheme for dealing with the pirates.</p>
<p>"If you want a good day's rabbiting," he said, "stop
the holes, stop 'em up, Truscott."</p>
<p>His main idea was that the pirates must have, somewhere
in the archipelago, a base from which they operated,
where they repaired and revictualled their ships, and
where they warehoused their captured goods before selling
them.  The authorities on the mainland had assured him
that no such dépôt existed on the mainland, so he only had
the archipelago to trouble about, and now he determined,
first of all, to examine every island.  The archipelago is
roughly divided into five great groups, and his scheme was
to examine each group, one at a time.  The three gunboats
and the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>, which had been placed under his orders
by the Viceroy, were to do the exploring work, and he was
going to steam slowly, backwards and forwards to
leeward, in order to catch anything that tried to escape.
You must understand that junks can hardly beat to
wind'ard, and would fly "down" wind.</p>
<p>His orders to Rashleigh and to the skippers of the
other two gunboats, the <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> and <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis>, which
arrived a day or two later, were—"You fellows, go in
and turn out the game, umph!  and Old Lest'll bag it
when it comes down to him;" and his orders were the
same, though not in those words, to the Captain of the
<emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Once the last gunboat had arrived, he did not lose any
time, but weighed anchor the very next morning, and with
the clumsy old black corvette and the three little white
gunboats puffing after him, steered for the north.</p>
<p>He chose to examine the northerly group first, because
the winds, at that season of the year, always had a good
deal of "northerly" in them, and, as I said before, junks
beat to wind'ard so slowly that they would never think of
trying to escape in that way.</p>

<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>Jim Rawlings and I managed to hold our end "up" all right
in the gunroom, and hadn't been aboard a week before
the Sub begun to leave us alone.  We had hoped that that
wretched telegram had been lost somewhere, but it turned
out that it had only been "hung up" at Shanghai, and
when the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> came down with the Admiral's answer
to the Captain's letters, she brought it with her.  Dicky
was on watch, heard Mr. Rashleigh tell someone that he
had a telegram a fortnight old for the Captain, guessed it
was ours, and rushed down to the gunroom flat to tell us.
He looked as frightened as we felt.  Jim suggested asking
Willum to try and steal it from the Captain's table, and
we did, but Willum didn't like midshipmen, and told us
that the Captain had his hand on top of it too, so we could
do nothing but huddle up on our chests and wait.</p>
<p>Presently someone shouted down that we'd been ordered
to recapture the yacht and go for the pirates, and everyone
began yelling and shouting and cheering; you could hear
the cheers as the news passed along from one mess to the
other.  It was so exciting, that Jim and I forgot all about
that wretched telegram, and we all made a fearful row in
the gunroom, and Mr. Hamilton, the big Engineer
Lieutenant, hammered out "Rule, <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>" and "We won't go
home till morning" on the piano.  It was simply grand.</p>
<p>It was just about "seven bell" tea time when we heard
the news, and when we'd let off steam Mr. Langham
banged on the table for silence.  "Gentlemen," he shouted,
"on this great occasion, before you commence to stuff
yourselves with bread and jam, we will perform the
time-honoured ceremony of 'over the main top', the last
midshipman down to have no 'seven bell' tea.  Stand by!"
and we all tried to get a good position near the door.
"One!  Two!  Five!  Go!" and we all scrambled out,
helter-skelter up on deck, flattening out the sentry on the
Captain's cabin, who did not get out of the way in time,
up to the boat deck, into the starboard main rigging,
clambered up it, into the fighting top, jumped across in a
mob, down the port main rigging, half sliding and getting
our hands trodden on, and dashed back to the gunroom,
where the Sub-lieutenant and the A.P. were sitting with
their watches in their hands, to see whether any records
had been beaten.</p>
<p>I was amongst the first few, because I had got a good
start, but Jim was nearly last—I'd seen him helping Dicky
to haul himself into the fighting top.  Dicky and Ponsonby—he
was called Pongo for short—a fat little cadet, were
actually the last, coming in together and both claiming not
to be last.  Dicky, like an ass, squeaked out, "He trod on
my thumb," and held it up to show the blood, "going up
the ratlines," and Pongo gasped, horribly out of breath,
"I couldn't climb into the top, I couldn't really; I nearly
fell," and we all yelled with delight.  "You climb into you
hammock fast enough, you fat little beast," said Mr. Langham.
"The first three are Mr. Webster, Mr. Smith, and
Mr. Johnson.  Mr. Pongo and Mr. 'Dear Little Dicky'
are last—a dead heat; neither of them will have any
seven bell tea.  Fall out!  Dismiss'"</p>
<p>It had just struck seven bells too, and Ah Man, the
Chinese messman, and Hong Cho, his steward, had
covered the table with cups and plates, loaves of bread,
tins of salt butter, and pots of jam.  We all scrambled for
places—there wasn't room for us all to sit down together—and
grabbed at Ah Man's long white coat as the fat old
chap came along, with his big teapot, and tried to get an
early whack of tea.  "No can do, Gen'l'men!  Makee
too muchee bobberee; no can do, all same one time," the
old chap shrieked in his funny voice, as he pushed his way
between the table and the bulkhead.</p>
<p>Poor Dicky and Pongo had to wait on the Sub, cut him
slices of bread, spread them with butter, pile them up with
jam, and then stand to attention, whilst he very slowly ate
them, and made funny remarks with his mouth full—we
had to laugh at them, whether we thought them funny or
not.</p>
<p>"The great thing in life, Mr. Pongo," he said, stuffing
a huge piece of bread and jam into his mouth, "is to
be moderate in everything," and when he could speak
again, "You, Mr. Dear Little Dicky, may suck your
bleeding thumb if you're thirsty, and don't take it out
again until I tell you."</p>
<p>So there Dicky had to stand, with his thumb in his
mouth, looking an ass, and awfully miserable.</p>
<p>"There is still a chance of your getting some tea, my
pet lambs," he went on.  "Jones and Withers will be here
in five minutes" (they were the midshipman of the watch
and signal midshipman, and came off watch at 4 o'clock),
"and they'll have to go over the 'main top' before I
can make my final decision."</p>
<p>It wasn't much of a chance, and when they did come
down and were ordered over the "main top", they were
back again in a very much shorter time than Pongo or
Dicky had taken.</p>
<p>"I am so very sorry," said the Sub, chaffing them, "but
for my sake, do try and keep alive till dinner-time!"</p>
<p>"Now do, just for our sakes!" shouted nearly everyone—except
Jim, who was angry, and I rather fancy I didn't,
because I was angry too, for it really wasn't fair sport to
make fun of such an ass as Dicky.</p>
<p>The buglers sounded off "evening quarters" just then,
so Pongo and Dicky escaped any more "rotting", though
they dare not have any tea or cake, even when the Sub's
back was turned, because that was against the rules.</p>
<p>Directly after the "dismiss" was sounded, Jim and I
were sent for by the Captain.  All our excitement simply
fell out of us, and we were fearfully frightened—Jim was
as pale as a sheet.  We went in together and stood to
attention in front of him, quaking all over.</p>
<p>"Umph!" he growled.  "What's the meaning of this?"
and he held out the hateful telegram; but we hadn't the
pluck to say anything—words wouldn't come.  "Infernal
cheek, that's what it was, and must have cost you a pretty
penny," and he glared at us over his cigar smoke.  "A
pretty penny, eh?"</p>
<p>Jim managed to tell him "One pound fifteen, sir."</p>
<p>"Umph! silly young fools," and then he hunted through
drawer after drawer in his knee-hole table, we didn't know
in the least what was going to happen—Jim told me
afterwards that he thought he was hunting for a cane—found
a couple of sovereigns and gave us each one—I nearly
dropped mine, I was so surprised—and growled out, "Off
you go; don't do it again."</p>
<p>We just had the presence of mind to say, "Thank you,
sir," and streaked out like lightning, feeling happier than
I can tell you, for now we hadn't a worry in the world—well,
hardly, for the Sub didn't really count, nor Dicky
either—and we had nothing to spoil our thinking about
the pirates.</p>
<p>That very afternoon Mr. Hobbs and Miss Hobbs came
on board to tea with the Commander, and he presently
sent down to tell the Sub to have the place "tidied up",
as she wanted to come down and see the gunroom.  She
came, too, in a few minutes, and those of us who could not
escape were introduced to her, and then she sat down at
our old "jingly" piano and sang nigger songs to us, and
we got over being shy, and the others gradually came in,
and we crowded round her, standing on the benches and
table, and joined in the choruses.</p>
<p>She was so absolutely "ripping", that when she went
away we all sang "For she's a jolly good fellow", and did
the hip! hip! hooray! part jolly well—because we meant
it.  She got quite white, I don't know why, some tears
actually ran all down her face, she put her hand on
Mr. Langham's arm—he looked jolly uncomfortable, but couldn't
move away because he kicked up against the gunroom
stove—and said, "Guess you're all too sweet for words,"
and slipped away back to the Commander's cabin, where
her father was.  That made us quiet again—the tear part,
I mean—and she looked such a regular "brick", that we
all would have done anything for her, and it made it still
more exciting to know that it was her yacht which we were
going to try and get back.  Jim swore that he'd "scupper"
the brute who'd cut off her hair, if he could find him,
and I'm certain that we all wanted to have a jolly good try
too.</p>
<p>Well, at last we did get away, one exciting morning, the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> coming along with us,
and the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> simply making the whole sky behind us
as black as your hat.  The smoke she made was so thick,
that it looked as if it didn't like coming out of her funnel.</p>
<p>For a week we wandered backwards and forwards to
leeward of one of the groups of islands, all of us in double
watches at night, so as to keep a better look-out, but
nothing happened, and after that we chose another group
and waited outside while the gunboats searched it.  Still
nothing happened, and I don't mind telling you that this
wasn't our idea of excitement and pirate chasing.  A third
week had nearly gone by when our first news of the pirates
came.</p>
<p>Very early one morning the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> was sighted
coming towards us very fast, and presently her Captain,
Mr. Rashleigh, bounced on board.  He was quite purple in the
face with excitement, and looked fatter than ever.  "The
Skipper hasn't turned out yet," the Commander told him,
as he took him down below.  "You'd better be careful.
He's a bit 'livery' in the morning."  He hadn't been
below three minutes before he bounced up on deck again,
looking "down in the mouth", went back to his gunboat
without saying a word to anybody, and the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>
steamed away.</p>
<p>The Commander had to go to the Captain immediately,
and through the open skylight I heard the Captain bellow,
"that fat little blockhead has let 'em slip through his
fingers.  He drives the crew of a junk ashore, and never
stops to see what becomes of 'em.  I've sent him back, and
we'd better follow him."  Then I heard him give a terrific
"Umph!"</p>
<p>Dicky found out all that had happened from the
coxswain of the whaler which had brought Mr. Rashleigh
across.  He had slipped down the ladder directly, which
was rather a smart thing to do.  The coxswain had told
him that yesterday evening, just as it was getting dark,
they had sighted a junk becalmed under an island.  Her
crew could be seen getting out their sweeps and working
at them frantically to try and escape, but Mr. Rashleigh
had turned on the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> searchlight, and, so the
coxswain said, thrown a drum of oil on the fires.  At any rate,
he jolly soon began to overhaul her rapidly, and as she
came up, the junk's crew jumped overboard and swam for
the shore.  Mr. Rashleigh immediately sent a cutter's
crew away to board her.  Fortunately there had been some
little delay in shoving off, and before they could pull
halfway the junk blew up, which proves that she must have
been a pirate.  The cutter was so close that pieces of
burning wood actually fell into the boat, and it was jolly lucky
that they weren't actually alongside.</p>
<p>Mr. Rashleigh had only waited to pick up the cutter, and
had then steamed back to us.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> didn't wait long after the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> had gone
back again, and followed her to the island, but by the
time we'd got there, there wasn't a trace of the junk.
Then came more excitement, for "A" small-arm company—that
was my company, the left half of it at any rate—was
"piped" to fall in.  I had to get my gaiters on, and
a revolver and a cutlass, and then superintend the serving
out of ammunition.  Mr. Travers, a tall, very aristocratic
Lieutenant, was in charge, and the Commander came too—more
excited than anyone—and we were all sent ashore.
The Commander sprang into the soft mud with a whoop,
and more or less waded ashore, and we all followed him.  I
got covered with mud up to my knees, and that pair of
trousers was never of any use afterwards except for dirty
work.  It was only a bit of an island, with a small village
on the opposite side, so we spread out in skirmishing order
and crept down on it, expecting to have shots fired at us
every second.  There seemed to be a lot of smoke about,
and there was a burning smell in the air, and when we'd
got within three hundred yards the Commander gave
another whoop and sang out, "Rush 'em, boys!" and we
all raced down as hard as we could, but the only living
things, there, were some pigs and dogs, which ran away
squealing and yapping.  There was only one hut which
hadn't been burnt to the ground—some were still
smouldering—-and down on the beach were two dead corpses—ugh!
They were the first I had ever seen, and though I didn't
really want to do so, I couldn't help going down to look at
them closely.  Some of my men turned them over with
their feet, to see how they'd been killed, and then I had to
go away.</p>
<p>Presently some of the villagers began to creep back, and
then we learnt from them what had happened, through a
Chinaman whom we had brought with us as an interpreter.
In the middle of last night a band of men had swooped
through the village and set fire to the huts.  Whilst the
frightened people were trying to escape or put out the fires,
they'd cut the mooring ropes of a junk lying close inshore,
and had sailed away.  It was their only junk, too, and the
poor brutes were absolutely ruined.  Before we left the
village they'd all come back, and were moaning and
wringing their hands, but doing nothing to help themselves.  I
shall never forget one poor old woman, just a wrinkled bag
of bones she was, sitting on a stone in front of one of the
half-burnt huts.  They had brought one of the corpses to
her, and she was swaying from side to side, making a funny
noise, and looking past everything, as though she was
mad.  One of the bluejackets gave her some tobacco as
we went by.  "Here, mother!" he said, "here's a bit of
navy prick,"[#] and she snatched it from him, stuffed some
of it into her mouth, and went on swaying and moaning.</p>
<p>[#] Navy Prick—Navy tobacco is served out in the raw leaf,
and after being
rolled and squeezed together by the men, is known as Navy Prick.</p>
<p>When we got aboard again—I'd never been so dirty in
my life—the Captain was simply furious.  I heard him say,
"If that little fool had only stayed where he was, he'd
have caught 'em," and we steamed back to our cruising
ground.</p>
<p>That didn't end the day's excitement—not by a long
chalk—for presently we sighted a solitary junk, thought
it might be the one in which the pirates had escaped,
and chased her.  However, it turned out to be one of
the Tinghai war junks looking for us, and bringing letters
from the Taotai and Mr. Hobbs.</p>
<p>The news must have been very serious, for the Commander
and the Navigator and the Engineer Commander
were all sent for, and we could hear the Captain's bellowing
voice talking very fast.</p>
<p>We soon knew why; Willum and the sentry told us.
The pirates had raided the monastery of Tu Pu, cleared
out all the monks' hoards, and left them hardly anything
except what they stood up in.  The Taotai had written
imploring us to go back to Tinghai.</p>
<p>We didn't understand how important this was till the
A.P. (Moore, the Assistant Paymaster) heard of it, and
then he whistled, "My aunt! you chaps, it's the richest
monastery in North China, and you can see it from
the top of Joss House Hill—it's not twenty miles away."</p>
<p>Well, that made it exciting enough for anyone, and
showed how daring these pirates were becoming; and
we all expected to go back at once, but someone heard
the Captain growl, "I've made my plans, and I'm not
going to fly this way and that way, every other second,
for all the blooming Taotais and pirates in the world."  So
we didn't go back till the Saturday afternoon—as
we had arranged.  No sooner had we anchored under
Joss House Hill, than the Taotai and Mr. Hobbs came
on board, the old Chinaman in a great state of funk.
They brought two other Chinamen with them, and they
turned out to be two of the servants at the monastery.
Six days ago the monks had given shelter to some seamen,
who had knocked at the great gates and told a yarn of
having been shipwrecked.  At night these chaps had
knocked the doorkeepers on the head, opened the gates,
and let in a whole crowd of Chinamen, and while some
of them kept the monks in their quarters, the others
had looted the treasury and carted away everything of
value.  One of these two men had been too frightened
to notice anything, but the other said that he had managed
to escape, had hidden in a swamp down by the sea, and
had seen two steamers, one large and the other small,
close inshore, and that the robbers all went away in
them.</p>
<p>"That's Hobbs's yacht and the tramp steamer, I'll bet
you anything," the Sub said.</p>
<p>The Captain came up to see the Taotai and Mr. Hobbs
over the side, and we heard him ask Mr. Hobbs: "What's
become of that great German chap Hoffman, eh?"</p>
<p>"He streaked across to squint at that collection of old
monks right away.  Says he'll get information from them
at first hand, and means to find that yacht of his before
he's much older, I guess."</p>
<p>"Where's Darter Sally?" asked the Captain.</p>
<p>"Staying up at the Mission House.  Guess she's gotten
a shy fit and wouldn't come on board," and the little man
smiled, whilst the Captain snorted, as if that was the
last thing in the world he could believe.</p>
<p>We had been away from Tinghai for nearly three weeks,
and of course we had run out of fresh grub down in the
gunroom, so you can bet your boots the very first thing
that Mr. Langham did was to send Ah Man ashore to
buy some; and he came back with a sampan loaded down
with things, mutton and fowls and ducks and eggs, and
any amount of green stuff.  We had a grand "blow out"
at dinner that night, and afterwards the band played
on the quarterdeck, and the ward room officers sent
down to ask us to join forces in two double sets of
"lancers".</p>
<p>Several officers from the gunboats, and that ripping
Chinese friend of Mr. Lawrence, had come on board
too, and we had a great time.  Jim Rawlings was on
watch, so he turned Dicky over to me as my partner,
with a handkerchief tied round his leg, below the knee,
to show that he was a lady; and though he spoilt the
dance, because he didn't much care for the free fight
part of it, that did not matter much, as we never finished
it.  Just when we were in the middle of the "grand
chain", down came a signalman to report that there was
a fire on shore, and everyone stopped to look at it.  Then
another started some distance from the first, and then
a third, till soon flames were shooting up from several
parts of Tinghai, close down by the water's edge, and we
could hear a great row going on.  Somebody suddenly
sang out, "There's a rifle shot", and we all listened,
and in a moment or two could distinctly hear rifles
going off; and then tom-toms banged furiously all over
the town, and one of the junks fired three guns and burnt
a red light.</p>
<p>We all stopped dancing and watched the flames.  We
could see them eating their way along the water front,
bending and curling as the breeze swept them in front
of it, and spreading up the sides of Joss Hill.  Seen
through our telescopes, it was a very grand sight, for
the native houses burnt fiercely, and soon the whole
of the harbour between us and the town was glowing
with the fire.  We could see the trading junks hurriedly
trying to cast off from the shore before the flames reached
them, drifting across the reddened water, and disappearing
like black ghosts.  We could also presently hear the actual
crackle and splutter of the fire, and even the shouts of the
Chinese.  The Commander had been all this time fidgeting
round the Captain, evidently wanting to suggest something,
but not quite liking to do so, and I heard him whisper to
the Gunnery Lieutenant to get everything ready to land
the fire engines.  Mr. Whitmore went away with a grin on
his face to do this, very quietly, and we all watched the
Captain to see if he was going to give the order, and
almost shivered with excitement at the prospect of being
sent ashore—at any rate, I know that I myself shivered.
The Commander still fidgeted round the Captain, when
suddenly there was such a furious burst of flames, that he
plucked up courage, and we—we were all listening and
longing for him to speak—heard him say: "It's getting
pretty bad, sir.  It seems to be working its way
uphill towards the Mission House, and there seems to be
a good deal of rioting going on, sir."</p>
<p>"Umph!" the Captain growled, sticking his cigar into
the corner of his mouth, so that he could use his
night-glasses better.  The Commander knew that it was very
inadvisable to actually suggest landing the fire engines,
because the Captain hated anything being suggested to
him; but we saw that he was getting more and more
nervous, and at last he broke out again: "It's not more
than half a mile from the Mission House now, sir, and
a native crowd is very apt to get out of hand.  I hope
the mission people and those Americans can clear out
in time."</p>
<p>"I suppose you want to land and put it out, do you?"
grunted the Captain.  "All right, do what you like, umph!
Teaching your grandmother to——  Umph!"</p>
<p>You may be pretty certain that we all heard every word,
and were off that quarterdeck in a twinkling, rushing down
below to change into our oldest uniform, even before the
bo'sn's mate, who was standing by to pipe it, yelled out:
"Away fire engines for landing," and then "'A' and 'B'
small-arm companies fall in," whilst the bugler sounded
off the marines' call.</p>
<p>Dicky came down to help me find my things—he was
not to land—and the strange little beggar excitedly
strapped on my gaiters, to save time.  As you know,
I was one of the Mids of "A" company, and was on
deck again in a brace of shakes to see my half company
of twenty-five men fall in, my heart simply thumping
with delight when I saw one of the gunner's mates
passing round ball cartridge.  I don't know anything
which gives you more of a thrill than the feel of a
handful of loose cartridges, when you know that you may
have to use them, in a few minutes, for the real thing.</p>
<p>In twenty minutes we were halfway ashore, towed
by the steam pinnace.  Looking back, we could see the
sides of the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> and the gunboats, simply looking
as if they'd been painted red and glowing; and as we
drew nearer the shore, it seemed to us that the whole
town was on fire, the flames roaring and crackling in
the most terrifying manner.  Right up above the flames
and the smoke we saw the Joss House on top of the
hill all lighted up too, and perhaps what was the weirdest
thing of all, was that funny strange sound that a frightened
mob always makes.</p>
<p>Mr. Travers, the lieutenant of "A" company, formed
up directly we landed, about fifty yards from the edge
of the water, and we had to keep back an excited crowd
which began to gather, while "B" company and the
marines scrambled ashore and dragged the fire engines
and hoses out of the boats.</p>
<p>I don't think that I had ever been so excited in my
life.  It was rather nervous work too, for the Chinese
began pressing against us—an evil-looking crowd they
were, come from the old town, we learnt afterwards—but
Mr. Travers was simply splendid.  He is a tall, thin,
frightfully lackadaisical and aristocratic-looking man,
and he stood there, in front of "A" company, and never
stirred a muscle, though the natives thronged around him
and hustled him.  You would have thought that he did
not even see them.  Presently some stones began flying
amongst us from somewhere at the back of the mob,
and my men began to get impatient—you could feel that,
even without watching them shuffling from one foot to
the other, or jamming their caps down on their heads,
or pulling their chin stays down, as if they were getting
ready for a scrap.  The crowd got bolder then, and began
to press still more closely.  I was nearly separated from
my half company, and was really rather nervous, when
Mr. Travers sang out: "'A' company, at 'shun!  Fix
swords!"[#] I repeated: "Left half company!  Fix
swords!" and was very relieved to do so, I need hardly
tell you, and drew my dirk.  The men all bent down to
the left, and it was very comforting to hear the rattle
of their bayonets being snapped on the rifles.  "'A'
company!  Stand at ease!" sang out Mr. Travers, and
you could see the two lines of bayonets, like streaks
of light, looking jolly sharp and pointed.</p>
<p>[#] Bluejackets' bayonets are always spoken of as
"swords" in the navy,
and the order is always, "Fix swords".
The Royal Marines give the order, "Fix bayonets".</p>
<p>The Chinese didn't stay too close after that, especially
as the remainder of the men had landed by this time, and
we began to advance up the beach and into the town.  It
was very unpleasant at first, because the flames seemed so
close and almost scorched us, roaring in places so loudly
that we could not hear any orders.  We had to move aside,
too, every now and then, to avoid burning pieces of wood
that fell, but we gradually worked round in front of the
fire, to make our way uphill towards the Mission House, and
pressed along through the streets which had not yet been
attacked.  A Chinese street is bad enough in the daytime,
but it was perfectly horrid now, and we had to force our
way along, pressing a yelling "smelling" mob in front
of us.  These streets were almost dark, too, which made it
all the worse, and I don't know how we managed to get
along as well as we did, stumbling at every other step,
and lurching into each other.  I tried to keep as close
to Mr. Travers as possible, but it was almost like a free
fight, and we shoved and pushed for all we were worth,
sometimes having even to use our fists to clear a way.
More often than not, I was simply carried forward by
the pressure of my men behind me, and all the time we
could hear the fire roaring and crackling only two or
three streets off.  We had first to make a wide sweep
round to the right, then go uphill to get round the
fire and above it, and then back again to the left in
order to get between it and the Mission, where, of course,
we knew that the missionary, his wife, Mr. Hobbs, and
his daughter must be in great danger.  We fought our
way along as fast as we could, and presently got into
a broader street, where the crowd did not bother us so
much, and where we made much better progress, but
were right to leeward of the burning town, and were
smothered with smoke and sparks.  Just then Jim
Rawlings rushed up—he was acting as "doggy" to the
Commander—bringing with him a native, covered with
blood.  "The Commander wants you to hurry on as
fast as you can," he told Mr. Travers; "they're looting
the Mission.  This man will show you the way; he's one
of the Mission servants."</p>
<p>"My God, that's what I feared!" groaned Mr. Travers,
and shouted to the men to "double".  "Double,
men! double!" and 'A' company, spitting and choking and
coughing, because of the smoke, commenced running.
From somewhere in the rear the Commander joined us,
Jim panting behind him.  He had his sword drawn,
and looked terrible.  "I've brought ten more men,
Travers," he gasped, and had enough breath to shout:
"Keep it up!  Keep it up, men!  There are women
to be saved!"  The men yelled, and went even faster
than before, panting and sweating.  We'd got above
the town, well clear of the fire, but we could still feel its
heat, and were wet through with sweat.  The Chinese
servant couldn't keep up with us, but that did not matter,
for we suddenly turned a corner and saw, three hundred
yards ahead of us, the white walls of the Mission House,
and saw that it was surrounded by a howling mob of
natives.</p>
<p>I heard the Commander give a groan, a funny kind of sob
it was, and he and Mr. Travers and Jim and I simply tore
along.  We hadn't more than four men with us, because
the others, with their rifles in their hands, were not able to
run so fast; but I don't think anybody would have stopped,
even if he had been alone, and the mob had been twice
as big.  You thought of nothing but pretty little Sally
Hobbs with her great eyes and her cropped hair.  Suddenly,
from a street on our left, darted a tall figure,
brandishing a sword and followed by twenty or thirty more.
They rushed out from the dark shadows of the houses, and
we thought they were going to attack us—at any rate, I
did—and I don't mind confessing that I felt frightened,
though chiefly, I think, because a scrap with them would
hinder us from rescuing Sally Hobbs.  One of our men
fired his rifle, we heard a yell of pain, and then, before
we could do anything more, the leader came out into
the firelight, and we saw that it was Lieutenant Ching,
of the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.  "Come on, sir!" he shouted, and
we all mixed together in a crowd, and ran as fast as
we could.  Two huge Tartar bluejackets panted beside
me, their felt boots hardly making the least noise, and
I don't think that I shall ever forget them, or their
white faces, or the sound of their breathing as they ran
alongside me, making not the least noise with their feet.</p>
<p>The mob was so busy, trying to fight a way for itself
into the Mission, that they didn't see us till we were
right among them.  Mr. Ching got there first, then the
Commander and Mr. Travers, and I and the two Tartars
plunged in after them, and fought our way towards the
little gate.  Just as we plunged in, the mob gave a great
howl of delight, and I saw flames shoot out from the
downstairs windows.  This took their attention away from
us, but it was awful, and we hit all the harder.  They didn't
oppose us much till we got to the gateway, and there we
met a stream of them coming back from the house, loaded
with chairs and clothes and all sorts of things.  We had
a fierce tussle for a minute or two, knocked them over or
brushed them aside, and rushed up the path to a verandah.
It was then that I missed Mr. Travers.  I had simply been
following close behind, squeezing into the gap he made in
front, but now, all of a sudden, I missed him.</p>

<p>
A FIERCE TUSSLE</p>
<p>
<emphasis>A FIERCE TUSSLE</emphasis></p>
<p>The remainder of "A" company had arrived by this
time, and we could hear them at the back of the mob,
fighting their way through to us.  Some of them began
shooting, so the Commander sent me back to steady them—a
jolly difficult job, too, and I didn't like going through
the crowd by myself; but they seemed to clear aside, and I
managed to get hold of one or two of the petty officers, and
gradually got the men into something like order.  There
wasn't any need to shoot, because the crowd had now
fallen back in alarm, and were only booing and yelling and
throwing stones.</p>
<p>Then I saw a commotion in the crowd, and suddenly
that big German, who had come on board once with
Mr. Hobbs, and beaten the Captain at weight-lifting,
burst through and rushed past me, his face all drawn
and haggard.  "She's lost, mein Gott!  She's lost!  Too
late!" and he dashed into the burning house, and I heard
him roaring, "Sally!"</p>
<p>Jim Rawlings came up panting and asking for ten men,
and disappeared with them among the sparks and smoke,
into the darkness behind the house, which was now a mass
of flames from top to bottom, with big flames licking out
from every window.  The heat was intense.  It was really
a most awful time, with the burning house behind me and
that mob of wild people below, all longing to cut our
throats, only not daring to rush us, because they had
no one to lead them.  I could still hear the Commander's
voice bellowing inside the house and calling the missionary
and Mrs. Macpherson, and Mr. Hobbs and Sally, by
name—but no one answered, and there was no sign of any
of them.  For one moment Mr. Ching appeared at an
upper window, then the roof began to fall in, but they
both crawled out on to the verandah before it collapsed
altogether with a crash.</p>
<p>They would have been buried and burnt alive if they had
stayed another second.</p>
<p>"That German man has just gone in, sir."</p>
<p>"He's dead by now," the Commander answered grimly,
and my blood seemed to go quite cold, as the flames rushed
up into the sky, hundreds of feet up, and I knew that
Mr. Hoffman was being burnt to ashes.</p>
<p>The rest of our people—the marines and "B" company,
with the fire engines—came up now, and the crowd split in
two to let them pass, and I had an insane hope that even
then they might be able to save that German; but by the
time they had dragged the hand pumps up the path, and
got their hoses led to a little stream at the back of the
house, they might just as well have tried to put the
fire out by spitting at it.</p>
<p>Seeing that there was no chance of looting any more,
the crowd seemed to melt away.  Probably they went
off to loot elsewhere.  They were more of the old town
mob, and weren't going to waste time, I expect.</p>
<p>The Commander ordered the pumps to stop heaving—it
was really silly to go on with them—and then we scattered
in little parties to search the hill behind the house.  The
Commander was fearfully angry because Mr. Travers was
not there to take charge of his men.  "He's never where
he's wanted," he said, and took most of "A" company
away with him.</p>
<p>"Where can Mr. Travers have gone?" I kept on
wondering, but hadn't much time for thinking, as I only
had been left a very few men to guard the burning house,
and there were still a good many prowling Chinese
sneaking round, and I had to make my men keep them away.
It seemed an awfully long time before suddenly we heard a
shout and a cheer from somewhere up the hill.  "Thank
God, sir, they've found that pretty little American lady!"
one of my petty officers said.  "It's worth spoiling our
clothes for that;" and in a minute or two Mr. Ching came
out from the darkness into the glare, bearing in his arms
a woman.  It wasn't Sally Hobbs, however, but
Mrs. Macpherson—I could see her black hair.  As he came
into the light I saw him look down at her face with a
strange expression, and then he gave a groan—I was
near enough to hear—laid her on the ground somewhat
roughly, and disappeared again.  Her husband
came too—he was a "rotter".</p>
<p>"Where's Sally Hobbs?" I asked, jumping across.</p>
<p>He shook his head, as he supported his wife.  "Don't
know.  She and her father went out to see the fire directly
it started, and we've not seen them since."</p>
<p>That sent the blood to my feet again and I felt terrible,
and almost thought of taking my men down into the town
to try and find her, though, of course, that would have
been idiotic; and, too, I had to stop where I was till
the Commander came back.  However, I sent an able
seaman to find the Commander, and presently I heard the
bugles sounding the "retire" and the "fall in", and
gradually the men came scrambling out of the dark and
formed up in the road in front of the ruins of the house.
Lieutenant Ching and his men came back too.</p>
<p>"What's to be done now," the Commander asked,
when he had heard the missionary's story.  Mr. Ching
turned a haggard face towards the town, where the fire
had nearly burnt itself out, and the greatest noise was the
noise of the mob, and I saw him shake his head in a terribly
sad way, "You no good there.  I take my men down and try
and find news."  He had no sword—he must have dropped
it—but in his hand was a grey tam-o'-shanter hat, and I
recognized it as the one Sally Hobbs was wearing that day
she came down into the gunroom.  He was clutching it
very tightly, and suddenly fell on the ground.  Our
Surgeon, Dr. Barclay, was over him in a moment.  He had
only fainted, but then it turned out that he had been
struck by that bullet, which one of our men had fired, just
as he and his men had joined us on the road.  It had gone
clean through his left shoulder, and he had lost a
tremendous lot of blood.  How he had managed to keep "going"
all this time, Dr. Barclay couldn't understand, and I
wondered how he had managed to carry Mrs. Macpherson,
and then remembered that he had put her down rather
clumsily, and understood why.  He called to one of his
men, gave him some hurried orders, and then they all
disappeared towards the town.  "Sent them to try and find
news," he told the Commander.  It was practically dark
now because the fires had gone out, but presently the
<emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis> searchlights were turned on to us and made
it less horrid.  Some Chinese soldiers also came running
up, followed a little later by the Taotai himself from
the old city, in his sedan chair, and surrounded by more
soldiers.</p>
<p>He was in a terrible fright when he found that he
was too late, and that Mr. Hobbs and his daughter
had not been found.  He did not stay long, and took
his men down to the town to keep order and find news
of them.</p>
<p>As there was nothing more to do till daybreak, the
Commander sent most of the men back to the ship
with the fire engines, and I had to go back with "A"
company, as Mr. Travers had not appeared.  It was horrid
work finding our way back to the sea, but I hardly
remember it, for I was very sleepy and awfully miserable,
and simply stumbled back, half asleep, thinking of Sally
and her father and that German, and of what could
have happened to Mr. Travers.</p>
<p>We got aboard about half-past three in the morning,
and I turned into my hammock, tired and miserable,
and pretended that I was asleep when Dicky tried to ask
for news, although I wasn't able to sleep for thinking,
and for being so miserable.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER IV</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Loss of Lieutenant Travers</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>No News of Sally Hobbs—A Discovery—Those Villainous
Pirates!—The Skipper is Furious—Weary Waiting—The
Skipper Rages—"I'll do 'em yet"</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Commander Leonard Umfreville Truscott, R.N.</emphasis></p>
<p>You have already heard of that disastrous fire at Tinghai,
and of our failure to rescue the American, Mr. Hobbs, and
his daughter Sally, the strange disappearance of Travers,
and the death of that German fellow, so that I will tell you
of what happened afterwards.</p>
<p>After sending Whitmore, our Gunnery Lieutenant, back
to the ship with the fire engines, the marines, and "A"
company, I waited for daylight, guarding what was left
of the Mission House with "B" company.  Our failure to
save little Sally Hobbs and her father cast a great gloom
over my men, which was still further increased when it
became evident that something serious must have
happened to account for the absence of Travers.  Young Ford
was most positive that he had seen him enter the Mission
gate, but after that no one seems to have seen him.
However, we fully expected him to turn up at daybreak,
and could do nothing to assist him till then, if he had
in some way or other lost his way in the darkness.</p>
<p>But I don't mind confessing that to protect Sally Hobbs
was uppermost in the minds of every officer and man
who had landed that night, and the thought of her,
surrounded by a howling mob of maddened Chinamen, was
the spur which had urged everyone so wildly through the
streets.  Our failure and her probable fate, down in the
burning town, made us bite our lips in great agony of
mind.  Fifty times during the night was I implored by
my men to take them down into the town itself; but I
knew that it would be useless, and that lost among those
narrow, straggling streets, and unable to keep in touch
with one another, we should be simply courting disaster.
If I had been alone I suppose that I should have gone, and
it was a great strain not to go, and take my eager men
with me; but I had no right to risk their lives uselessly.
It was quite another pair of shoes for Ching and his men,
because they were among their own countrymen, and ran
little risk by doing so.  Ching, himself, as soon as Barclay
had dressed his shoulder—it was most unfortunate that
one of our people had wounded him—followed his men
there and left us to ourselves.  I told him that we should
remain near the Mission all night, and resume our search
in the morning.  Poor fellow, I think he was as distressed
as any of us were at the fate of the little American girl, for
even his thin, usually expressionless face showed traces of
the anguish which we all felt.  In the house he had found
a grey tam-o'-shanter cap which she had worn, and I saw
him stuff it into his tunic, and, you may be sure, was in no
mood to chaff him about it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Macpherson told me, before her husband took her
away to the house of some native convert, that directly the
fire had started down in the town, Sally Hobbs, poor little
girl, had made her father take her down to see it,
throwing a shawl over her head and hurrying away, just as
she would have done in America, in spite of the earnest
entreaties of Macpherson himself.</p>
<p>As day dawned, Ching brought his men back, their faces
and uniforms blackened and torn.  "I have no news, sir.
Not a trace of her to be found;" and then he threw
himself down on the ground, utterly exhausted.  His
men—Tartars of splendid physique—were as worn out as he was.</p>
<p>As I expected, Captain Lester sent me a fresh lot of
men, and food for the few I had kept with me.  I therefore
started with them to make a more systematic search than
it had been possible to make in the darkness, leaving
my other fellows to share their food with their Chinese
comrades.  We searched the ground behind the Mission,
examining every hut and outhouse as we went, and gradually
spread out towards the left and towards a little bay or
sweep of the coast, which here ran into the land.  For an
hour we searched without result, but then a seaman came
running back with a uniform glove which he had picked
up by the side of a small path running down towards the
sea and that small cove.  The glove might or might not
have belonged to Travers, but I knew that he was
probably the only one of us who would have worn gloves—he
was rather eccentric about dress—so hoped that this
might be some clue to his disappearance, and followed
the path.  Almost immediately another man picked up
a handkerchief.  The initials in one corner were
H.C.L.—those of Lawrence, our navigator—but though he had
not landed, I knew that Travers had a weakness for
borrowing other people's things, and my hopes were
again raised.  I am afraid that my brain wasn't working
properly—the terrible night was responsible for that—and
for the life of me I could not imagine what reason could
have brought Travers along this path.  We yelled his
name, my bugler boy blew the "close", but without result,
except that all the mongrel curs in the neighbourhood
started yapping and howling.</p>
<p>I followed that path till it dipped over the crest of a
ridge and then led down to the little bay below us—a
little bay with a curved mud beach.  My men were on the
point of rushing down to it, when Trevelyan, the
Lieutenant who had brought them ashore and relieved
Whitmore, suggested that we might find traces of footmarks to
help us.  I therefore sounded the "halt", and he and I
went down alone.  Trevelyan was quite right, the muddy
shore was covered with footmarks in one place, and there
were also three long furrows in the mud, evidently made by
the keels of boats.  These furrows led right up to
high-water mark, and my brain was not too dense to appreciate
the fact that three boats had been there at high water.
We could trace the furrows for fifteen feet or more down
the shore, and one went much farther than the others.
"They shoved them off and had to push hard, sir,"
cried Trevelyan, bending down and showing me how
deep some footmarks were, and how the mud was piled
up at the back of them.  "It was at the last tide too,
sir, otherwise they would have been washed flat again."  That
was evident enough, but I couldn't think what he
was driving at.</p>
<p>"When was Travers last seen, sir?"</p>
<p>"About one o'clock in the morning—there or
thereabouts," I told him.</p>
<p>"Well, high tide was at about midnight, so these boats
must have been shoved off about an hour and a half
afterwards, half an hour or so after you lost Travers."  He
was getting quite excited, but, honestly, my brain
wouldn't work.</p>
<p>"And this boat must have been later still, sir," and
he pointed to the longer furrow.</p>
<p>Then there was a yell above us from some of the men
who had been wandering about, and we saw several of
them stooping over a clump of scraggy bushes, and one
came down to tell me that they had found some dead
Chinamen.</p>
<p>I went up and saw two—disgusting objects they were—with
their noses and lips cut off.  I couldn't stand the
sight; I'd had no breakfast, and walked away, feeling
dazed and sick, and opened my mouth and drew in the
sea breeze to drive the smoke fumes away from my head.</p>
<p>Trevelyan joined me in a few minutes.  "One of those
fellows has been shot at very close quarters, for his
clothes are singed and blackened, and the other has had
his head battered in.  Look, sir! they must have been
dragged along there," and he pointed to a broad mark,
running along the mud from the bushes to the furrows.</p>
<p>He ought to have been a detective, ought Trevelyan,
and was off in a "jiffy" to search for fresh traces.
"Footmarks! bootmarks! plenty of them, sir," he shouted
presently, and I saw him bending down and measuring
them with his handkerchief.  "Ours, I expect," I sang
back; but he shook his head, and presently came up to
me in a great pitch of excitement—he had taken his own
boots off by this time to avoid making any more marks—"There
are at least three different sizes down there, sir!
European bootmarks too.  One of them might belong to
Travers, but there are some very much larger ones than
his, and I don't think that one man made them all.  There
must have been several Europeans down here early this
morning.  This must be where the pirates landed and
shoved off again, sir—two of the boats more or less
together, and the third half an hour or so later—but
I'm bothered if I can make out those two corpses, and
what they are doing here."</p>
<p>I dragged him away.  He was very reluctant to go,
and kept turning back and scanning the shore with his
glasses.  Suddenly he took me by the shoulder—I was
so "jumpy" that his touch gave me quite a shock—"Look
there, sir!  What's that?" and before I could
say anything he darted back, began to undress, and then
wading and swimming, and clinging to some fishing
stakes which jutted out from the shore, he made his
way to where something hung from the farthest fishing
stake.  I could see that it was something coloured, and
as he came back with it I recognized it as a shawl
belonging to Mrs. Macpherson, and remembered that she
had told us that Sally Hobbs had borrowed one before
going down to the fire.</p>
<p>I knew what it all meant now—her disappearance—the
bootmarks on the shore—the furrows of those boat keels—and
the shawl—and that the poor little girl had again
fallen into the hands of those fiends of pirates.  One
cannot explain, or describe, how one feels on occasions
like this, though I do know that when Trevelyan rejoined
me presently, blue in the face with cold, and with his
teeth chattering, but bringing the shawl, and intensely
eager to solve the mystery, I felt as though I wanted
to hit him, and hated to have to tell him all it meant.</p>
<p>"Give it to me," I said harshly.</p>
<p>"No, sir; I cannot.  I found it, and if it turns out
as you say, I'm going to give it back to her."</p>
<p>We said not a word as we trudged back to the Mission
House, neither of us caring to speak of what we feared.
Ten minutes ago I should have been inexpressibly pleased
to have found Travers, but now I eagerly hoped that he
had been kidnapped too, and that, in some way or other,
he might be able to protect her—for her father I cared
not two straws, nor did I place reliance on any effort
of his to save either of them.</p>
<p>Fortunately Captain Lester was waiting for us near
the ruins of the Mission House, and it was a relief to
find him in a bad temper.  He didn't wait to hear what
I had to tell him, but, shaking his fist at me, bellowed
out, "This is the work of those villainous pirates"—he
was hardly able to speak for rage.  "Set fire to the
town—right under my nose—made a fool of Old Lest,
and cleared out again without a scratch.  And that little
lass too!  What's become of her and of that fool Travers?
I can't trust a single one of my officers.  Umph!  Here
you go ashore to put out a fire, don't save anyone, and
shoot that chap Ching.  Umph!  I'd like to——  Umph!"</p>
<p>I rapidly told him all that had happened.</p>
<p>"Poor little lass!  Poor little lass!" he groaned, and
all the anger died out of his face.  He came down with
me to that bay, saw the bodies and the marks on the
shore, sent people to scour all the neighbourhood; but
nothing more could be discovered, and we went back
again.</p>
<p>Presently the missionary came up—he'd been down to
see those bodies too.  He was shaking like a leaf, and his
sunburnt face was quite ashen in colour.  "Ah, mon!"
and he wrung his hands, "but one o' those puir dead
things was my servant.  I know him by his clothes—the
one with his head fair smashed in."</p>
<p>I had had too many puzzling events suddenly sprung
on me that morning, and, honestly, couldn't try to explain
this last, and could only say feebly, "Poor chap!  Poor
chap!"</p>
<p>"A vairy faithful mon, an' vairy leetil expense," moaned
the missionary.  Trevelyan showed him the shawl, and
he recognized it at once as the one Sally Hobbs had
thrown over her head before leaving the Mission, so
our last faint hope vanished.</p>
<p>Fortunately young Rawlings relieved the grimness of
everything just then.  He is a most pugnacious youngster,
and though I had sent him on board with Whitmore, he
had managed to come ashore again.  He had got into
trouble with two coolies—I suppose he had found them
looting—and had gone for them with his fists, and was
laying about him in fine style.  One had taken to his
heels, but the other stood his ground, and kept banging
at him with a piece of wood.  The Skipper caught sight
of them too, and, for all the bad temper he was in, smiled
grimly, and chuckled out, "Go it, youngster!"  Rawlings
had already received a nasty cut over the forehead, and
would have been "knocked out" in another minute, if
I hadn't stepped forward and knocked the fellow down.
I don't mind telling you that I put more "beef" into that
blow than was absolutely necessary.  Somehow or other
I felt I must hit somebody, and it was unlucky for that
Chinaman.</p>
<p>"Go down to the boat, Mr. Rawlings.  Umph! what
d'you mean by brawling?" growled the Skipper,
suddenly remembering himself.</p>
<p>The Skipper told me, as we walked back to the landing-place,
that several Europeans had been seen during the
night, and that they were evidently in command of parties
of Chinamen, who had prevented the inhabitants
extinguishing the flames when they first started.  This made
it positive that it had been the work of the pirates, and
confirmed the rumours that Europeans had frequently been
seen among them at different times, and when any outrage
on a large scale had been carried out.</p>
<p>What made the Skipper so furious was that they had
so completely outwitted him; and he became purple in the
face with fury at their daring to swoop down on the town,
under his eyes, as it were, burn half of it, kidnap Hobbs and
his daughter, probably Travers too, and get away scot free.</p>
<p>He took it as a personal insult, and I can't tell you
all the mad things he suggested.  He felt very much as
I did—he wanted badly to batter somebody's face, but
he soon quieted down, and walked beside me with great
strides, grunting and growling, and screwing up his face,
and I knew that he was trying to work out some plan in
his bull-dog brain.</p>
<p>But you can't hit a man till you've caught him, that
was the difficulty, and we had to catch him first, and
knew well enough that among these islands were a
thousand places where those two steamers—the tramp
and the yacht—could lie concealed for years.</p>
<p>"Unless they want to make money over 'em, they're
as good as done for," the Skipper said, as we went on
board.  "Poor little lass, not more'n a couple of years
older than my lass Nan!"</p>
<p>I had served with "Old Lest" seven years, and I
would do any mortal thing for him.  He pretended he
was a thundering bully, and was really as gentle as a
child; and the men worshipped him, his gruff voice and
great red face—even his bad temper.  I was extremely
sorry for him too, because the responsibilities resting on
him were so great, prompt action so necessary, and the
difficulties so enormous.</p>
<p>He did what I suppose was the best, and sent the
gunboats and the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> cruising, whilst we remained
at Tinghai, with fires "banked".  Leave to officers and
men was forbidden, and that meant, of course, that the
Skipper himself did not go ashore, and had to give up
his shooting, which was the one thing for which he lived.
The <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> was, in fact, kept ready to start within an
hour of receiving any news.</p>
<p>Meanwhile natives—as trustworthy as Ching and the
Taotai could procure—had been scattered through the
archipelago, and the war junks also had been induced
to leave Tinghai and endeavour to procure information.
The Skipper seemed to depend upon these particularly,
because they had naturally more intimate knowledge of
the islands and the character of the people.  They could
cruise, too, without attracting so much attention as our
gunboats.  They generally cruised for a week, and at
the end of that time came sailing back to Joss House
anchorage, covered with flags and firing off guns, but
with never a particle of news.</p>
<p>Week after week went by, and not a trace of the
pirates could be found.  Indeed, they seemed to have
disappeared off the face of the seas, and not a single
outrage had been reported since they had burnt Tinghai.
Rashleigh, coming back in the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, did certainly
report that he had one night heard what he thought
was the sound of guns somewhere off the Chung-li Tao
group, but had discovered nothing when he steamed in
the direction of the noise.  "Silly fool!" roared the
Skipper to me, "he don't know the difference between
thunder and guns."</p>
<p>These weeks of weary waiting were most depressing,
and the constant confinement on board, without any
exercise, most bad for our health—and tempers.</p>
<p>We now felt sure that someone, probably the dead
Mission servant, had guided Travers down to the shore
that night; that he, like the mad fellow that he was,
had rushed off alone, hoping to rescue Sally and her
father single-handed, and that he had been kidnapped
with them.  I forgot to tell you that Barclay, our
Surgeon, had found the bullet in the body of the mutilated
Chinaman, and that it was a service Webley revolver
bullet, so it was quite possible that Travers had shot
him.  There probably had been a scuffle, and the Mission
servant, not being worth capturing, had been killed and
mutilated to prevent recognition.</p>
<p>We all were so worried and depressed, that two days
of strenuous work, coaling ship from a collier, and another
day of cleaning ship afterwards, came as a welcome relief.
It's precious seldom that one does welcome that job, but
we did then.</p>
<p>For some long time I had not heard the noise of the
gunroom piano.  Someone or other would be banging it
at all hours of the day, and as the gunroom was immediately
beneath my cabin, the noise was a continual source
of annoyance to me.  My messenger used to be always
taking down fiery messages to the Sub, Langham.  The
absence of this noise was now a blessed relief, and when
I mentioned it to Langham, he asked me to go down and
see for myself the reason of it.  I went down, and found
that the piano was shut, and that <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> cap-ribbons
had been glued across, to prevent it being opened.  "Miss
Hobbs was the last to play it, sir, and the Mids and all
of us have sworn that no one shall play it again till she
does, and till she cuts those ribbons with the senior
mid's dirk."</p>
<p>"Who suggested that?" I asked, smiling.</p>
<p>"Mr. Langham, sir," several of the mids cried; but
he, getting red in the face, said it was Hamilton, the
Engineer, and he put it on to Moore, the A.P., so I
left them settling the subject, and only too glad that
the piano was so effectually sealed.</p>
<p>I think that everyone did feel, as the gunroom did,
that some day we should see them all aboard again—Travers,
with his mad, chivalrous notions and "tired"
manner, and the pretty little girl, with her winsome face
and funny twang.</p>
<p>At the end of the third week after the fire at Tinghai,
the United States gun-vessel, the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis>, came down to
place herself under the Skipper's orders and assist us in
our search.  She was larger than our gunboats, very
much more modern, and was rather quaint looking, with
one mast and an enormously long, thin smoke-stack.</p>
<p>"If that chap comes along here giving Old Lest advice,
Old Lest will——  Umph!" the Skipper growled when
she was sighted.</p>
<p>Her captain, a man named Parkinson, was a tall, gaunt,
disappointed man, with grey hair, and as old as Captain
Lester himself, though actually junior in rank to me.  He
came across to report himself, and I heard him say, "Guess
my boys thought the old <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> was a fixture in the
'chow-chow' water at Shanghai, and our mud-hook could never
be hauled out again.  Say, Captain, we are right pleased
to come and assist you."</p>
<p>He was sent away cruising.</p>
<p>Another weary week went by, and still no news came.</p>
<p>Then it turned out—one of the gunboats actually caught
them at it—that those war junks, on which the Skipper
relied so greatly for information, simply went out of
harbour, round the corner, and hid in a neighbouring creek
till their provisions ran out, and they had to come back
again for more.</p>
<p>This news put the finishing touches to the Skipper's bad
temper, and he was mad with rage, and sent for the Taotai
at once.</p>
<p>"Umph!  A pretty how d'ye do!  Those lumbering
junks of yours simply skulk out of sight round a corner,"
he roared; and when this had been interpreted to the
Taotai—I wondered how much the interpreter understood
and passed on correctly—the frightened old man gesticulated
feebly, and then out it came: "Taotai speaks, sir!
If junks caught by Pilons, he makee buy new ones—he no
caree."</p>
<p>So that was it, was it—the old chap didn't intend to risk
losing them?  He was given so much a year to keep so
many in good order, and if one was lost he would have to
replace it.  No wonder that we could gain no information
from them.</p>
<p>You should have seen—and heard—the Skipper when
he understood this, and you should have seen the old
Taotai hurry down to his state barge, hide under his red
umbrella, and shove off for the shore—glad enough he was
to get away, too.</p>
<p>Late that evening the Skipper sent for me.  He was
beaming all over his face, puffing out his cheeks and
working his shoulders, as I hadn't seen him do for a
fortnight.  He banged me on the chest and nearly knocked me
over.  "Willum, where the dickens is Willum?  Willum,
you scoundrel! bring the Commander one of my eighteen-penny
Havanas," he roared.</p>
<p>It was half past eleven; I wanted to turn in, and didn't
care to smoke, but it had to be done.</p>
<p>"Hit on a scheme, Truscott; I'll wipe the old Taotai's
eye; I'm going to put our own people aboard those junks,
and see if we can't make them useful like that.  Umph!
What d'you say to that?" and he thumped the table with
his huge fist, and glared at me.</p>
<p>"Six of 'em I'm going to take."</p>
<p>"Won't the old chap object, sir?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Object!  I'll teach him to object!  He's got it down
in black and white from his boss at Ningpo to put all his
forces at our disposal," and the Skipper winked at me from
behind a cloud of blue cigar smoke.  "He'll be pretty sorry
he tried to pull Old Lest's leg before he's done with me.
Umph!  Our only sporting chance is to catch some of
these rascals, and I'm not going to be too particular
how I get information from 'em when I do catch 'em."</p>
<p>Fortunately the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> came in that night, and
Ching helped us negotiate with the old gentleman in
the walled city.  He, I am certain, did his best; but
he told me, very candidly, that if we persisted in our
demands, we should touch their pride very greatly, and
that it would increase the already hostile feeling of the
Chinese towards us, and would very possibly prevent
any information coming in from private sources.</p>
<p>Captain Lester was much annoyed at the attitude he
took up, and always thought that he was the cause of
what happened, though, personally, I am sure that he
had acted honestly by us.  At any rate, the Skipper had
blurted out, "If he won't lend 'em to Old Lest, Old
Lest'll borrow 'em;" and somehow or other this threat
got to the Taotai's ears, and so scared the old gentleman,
that next morning not a war junk remained in harbour.</p>
<p>Ching came across directly, and protested that neither
he nor his Captain had any knowledge of their going to
sea.  I believed him, and so did everyone, except the
Skipper, who flew into a terrible rage, and I was very
glad to get Ching away and soothe his ruffled feelings,
but could not induce him to stay to breakfast.</p>
<p>"Made a fool of Old Lest again, have they?  Umph!
I'll—I'll—" he stuttered and bellowed when I reported
"divisions" to him, "I'll do 'em yet.  I'll buy half a
dozen of their big merchant junks and man 'em myself!
Old Lest'll sell a farm or two, if the Admiralty don't
pay for 'em."</p>
<p>"D'you mean that, sir?" I asked.</p>
<p>"D'you ever hear me say anything I didn't mean?"
he roared; and though I must confess I had done so,
I dare not say so.</p>
<p>I slipped away directly in my gig, and went across
to the old <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.  I saw her Captain and Ching
pacing gloomily up and down the poop, and it was
very pleasant to see their faces open out again when
they heard the news, and that their country's honour
was not to be disturbed.</p>
<p>Ching gripped me by the hand—"You English, sir,"—and
the muscles of his face were working strangely—"do
not understand how these things, these slights,
and—these little insults to our country hurt us.  All
you Western nations think we have no such love and
pride of country as you have, and do not feel it.  We
do, sir!  We do!"</p>
<p>I have always been glad that I did go aboard that
morning, for my ideas of the Chinese were very much
changed.</p>
<p>Ching himself came of a very old fighting stock—his
people had always belonged to a high military caste, and
his father had fought against the French well and nobly.
He himself—Lawrence had told me this—had fought
against the Japanese in the Yalu battle, and when all
his senior officers had been killed, and his ship almost
a wreck, had taken her out of action and staggered
across to Wei-hai-wei, keeping the light cruisers, which
hung round him, at a respectful distance with the one
gun that was able to fire.</p>
<p>Japanese naval men had told me the story, in admiration
of his plucky ship, but it was not till Lawrence told me
that I knew who had commanded her.</p>
<p>I knew Ching a good deal better after that.  He had
done more fighting than I ever hoped to have the luck
to do, and when one's job is to fight, and one gets paid
to keep oneself ready for it, one always admires a man who
has earned his pay.</p>
<p>Ching took me into his cabin once, a strange kind of
barn, half Chinese and half English, with two old faded
photographs hanging on the bulkheads, one of the
<emphasis>Inflexible</emphasis> and the other of her Mids, Ching in the middle,
and Lawrence, a fat little chubby-faced youth, by his side.</p>
<p>I often chaffed Lawrence about that photo—he looked
so angelic.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER V</strong></p>
<p><strong>Midshipman Ford's First Command</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Junk—H.M.S. "Sally"—"Here's Luck to the 'Sally'"—Ready
to Start—Under Way—In Command—Night at Sea—The
Strange Junk</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>If anybody had told me a week ago that by this time
I should be captain of my own ship, I should have called
him a blithering Ananias, and probably punched his head
if he was anything like my size, and made him jolly sorry
for trying to pull my leg.</p>
<p>But there it is.  I am the captain of the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, converted
junk, two guns, tender to H.M.S. <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and who, do
you think, is my first lieutenant?  Why, Dicky Morton,
"Dear Little Dicky" of all chaps in the world, and he's
turning out not to be half such a silly fool as he looks—I
often tell him so, just to buck him up.</p>
<p>I must tell you how it all happened.</p>
<p>The Captain had found out that those war junks never
cruised at all, simply hid round a corner out of sight, and
as he depended a great deal on them for news of the pirates,
he was simply furious when he heard of it, and sent ashore
and bought six of the biggest merchant junks.</p>
<p>I was with the party of men under Mr. Whitmore sent
to bring them off.  The steam pinnace was to tow them,
one by one, but got a rope round her screw, and delayed
everything whilst it was being cleared.  I happened to be
on board one of them with six men, preparing to be taken
in tow, and it struck me that it would be a jolly good
"wheeze" to sail off.  Mr. Whitmore sung out that I
might try, and I did, and got her off quite comfortably,
without breaking anything when I came alongside.</p>
<p>I had had a jolly lot of experience in sailing at Upton
Overy, both before and after going to the <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>, and
I don't want to be cheeky or anything like that, but it
seemed to come quite naturally to me to sail any boat,
and I always seemed to be able to feel exactly what was
wanted to make it sail its best.</p>
<p>The Captain was very pleased with me for doing this,
and that is how I got the command of my junk.</p>
<p>He had all of us Midshipmen and Cadets fallen in on the
quarterdeck, glared at us and growled, "Now, you young
gentlemen, you've got a job to do at last—no skrim-shanking
about it either—jolly hard job—and I want those
of you who can sail 'em best to take charge of 'em.  You've
got to get hold of some of those pirate fellows for
me—don't care how you get 'em, but get some of 'em alive.
Can't get anything out of the dead 'uns, umph!"</p>
<p>You can't imagine how excited that made all of us, and
when the six junks had all been lashed alongside, we had
to clean them first and fit them out afterwards.</p>
<p>The Commander told me that I could have the one
which I had sailed off, and told me that I could choose
one of the cadets to go with me.  Dicky came and offered
to do any mortal thing for me if I would take him—he was
nearly blubbing with keenness—so I said I would, and we
both had to start the job of cleaning her out.  The
Commander gave me twelve hands, and it was a jolly beastly job.
She was perfectly filthy, and we had to scrape away half
an inch of stuff from her inside with shovels before we
could even commence scrubbing.  The smell in the holds
was almost enough to knock anyone down, and we worked
till long after it was dark, and they had hoisted big
yardarm group lights to make it easier for us.</p>
<p>It rained too, but we didn't worry about that in the
least, because we were so jolly happy.  I'd never seen
Dicky like it before.  He was chirping about like a bloated
sparrow, and was much too happy even to speak.</p>
<p>You can see what the junk was like by the picture.
The great stern place was where we all had to live, and it
was something like a huge pigeon loft with three sliding-door
places in it.  One opened from the deck into a fairly
big place, where the rudder head came up through the
stern and the long tiller worked.  The ten bluejackets
were to live there.  Above it and under the poop deck
were two little places about eight feet square, and only
just a little more than four feet high.  In one of them
Dicky and I were going to live, and the two petty officers
who were coming had the other.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>
H.M.S. Sally</p>
<p>
<emphasis>H.M.S. Sally</emphasis></p>
<p>A narrow platform was below the two upper doors, with
a ladder running down on deck at one end, and one
running up to the poop at the other.  It looked exactly
like a pigeon loft.</p>
<p>All the time we were busy scraping and shovelling and
scrubbing, the carpenters and blacksmiths were busy
fitting two great balks of timber with some cross-pieces to
take a six-pounder Hotchkiss quick-firer and its mounting.
They were bolting them down to the deck and the sides of
the junk, just in front of the mainmast, and on the top of
the poop they mounted a Maxim gun.  The <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> hadn't
enough Maxim guns for all six of the junks, so three had
had Nordenfelt machine guns from the gunboats.  I had
never seen the ship so busy; she was humming from morning
to night, and for most of the night too, for four whole
days.  Besides the carpenters' and blacksmiths' work, the
anchor gear and all the standing and running rigging had
to be refitted or overhauled.  I only wish, as you will
know by and by, that more of it had been refitted, because
it really was not strong enough.</p>
<p>You can just imagine how excited Dicky and I were when
they did at last lower a six-pounder down into our junk,
and we saw it sitting in its mounting, and knew we might
soon have to use it.</p>
<p>We got most of the filth out of ours by the middle of
the second day, and the holds didn't smell so badly, though
we could never get the Chinese kind of smell out of the
living places under the stern.  What troubled us most
were the fleas and bugs and cockroaches.  They were
perfectly awful, and we couldn't get rid of them in the few
days we had.  We must have drowned thousands of them,
but there seemed to be just as many left, and we were
itching all over and covered with bite marks, even whilst
we were only working in her.</p>
<p>The cockroaches would watch us cleaning the bottom
boards, and when we went on to another spot they would
swarm down over the clean places, and squashing the
brutes made them dirtier than ever again.</p>
<p>It was Dicky who first thought of giving our junk a
name.  I wanted to call her <emphasis>Nan</emphasis>, because Nan was my
chum, but then I thought perhaps the Captain wouldn't
like it, and Dicky suggested <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> instead.  It turned out
that all the others wanted the same name, but Dicky was the
only one of them that got it.  You see, the letters had to be
cut out in wood first, and as all the carpenter people were so
frightfully busy, it was almost impossible to get anything
extra done at all.  But Dicky had made great friends with
the old Boatswain and Carpenter.  He used to go and yarn
with them in their cabins on the other side of the gunroom
flat, and used to take refuge there sometimes when we
had driven him out of the gunroom with our chaff, and
sometimes hide there when he was afraid of being bullied,
and Jim was not there to protect him.  It was really owing
to this that we were the only ones who did manage to get
it done, and then Dicky actually had the pluck to ask the
Commander for some gold leaf to gild the letters.  He
volunteered to do that too, and I went with him to the
Commander's cabin—outside the door—to give him
courage.  When he knocked timidly, and we heard the
Commander sing out, "Yes, what is it?" in his gruff voice,
Dicky looked as if he would have bolted away—I expect
he would have done so if I hadn't been there and the
sentry as well—but he just squeezed his lips together,
wriggled in at the side of the curtain, and squeaked out,
"Please, sir, gold leaf," and couldn't say another word,
he was so frightened.  I went in then, "Please, sir, we've
got Mr. Williams, the Carpenter, to cut out <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> for our
junk—in big wooden letters—and we want gold leaf,
please."</p>
<p>The Commander grinned at us—he was a perfect
ripper—took a book of gold leaf out of a drawer, and
gave it to Dicky.  "D'you boys think I'm made of gold
leaf?"  We didn't even thank him, we were so excited,
but rushed for'ard to the "paint shop" under the fo'c'stle to
see old Modley, the painter, and ask him to put the gold
leaf on for us.  We couldn't get anything out of him,
though.  He was a bit of a sea lawyer, and he "wasn't
going to do nothink but what he'd orders to do from the
Commander or the First Lootenant".</p>
<p>We didn't know what to do then, and went on deck and
climbed down to the junk, feeling miserable.  Scroggs was
there screwing the letters on to a board—Scroggs was the
petty officer who was coming with us—and we told him
all that had happened, and how we'd got the gold leaf, but
couldn't get Modley to gild the letters.</p>
<p>"You just give it to me, sir," he said; "that 'ere
Modley be a bit of a 'ard nut, but we both comes from the same
village down Dorset way, an' 'is missus goes to the same
chapel as my old missus, and 'e may do it for me."</p>
<p>He managed to get round him somehow, and when,
next morning, Dicky and I ran up on deck in our pyjamas,
as soon as it got light, to have another look at the junk, the
first thing we saw was the board on her stern, and the letters
all beautifully gilded.  We had to climb down, just as we
were, and lean over and look at them.  They looked
simply gorgeous, and there were Scroggs, and Sharpe, the
other petty officer, and one of the carpenter's crew, and old
Modley grinning at us.  They had just finished fixing the
board to the stern.  "Thank you very much," was all we
could think of saying; and when we all climbed up aboard
the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> again, the ship's cocoa was just being served
out, and Scroggs brought us a bowl of it and said, "Here's
luck to the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>," and we all sipped it, and Modley said,
"May the Lord have mercy on the little lass!" but the
carpenter's crew didn't say anything religious, because he
burnt his mouth.</p>
<p>Then we jumped down below before the Commander
could see us on deck in pyjamas, and rolled ourselves in
our hammocks again—we were jolly cold.</p>
<p>We had a good bit of gold leaf left, and I nudged Jim,
whose hammock was next mine, to tell him that he could
have it.  I knew he wanted it very badly to make his junk
look smart, and when we woke him and he knew about it
he gave a whoop! and tumbled out and woke the others;
and Dicky and I watched them having a grand pillow fight,
till we couldn't stand it any longer, and joined in, and got
splendidly hot—even Dicky joined in!</p>
<p>All that day we were busy getting ammunition on board,
and it was simply grand to see the boxes being lowered
into the hold and jammed there, so that they would not fall
about.  There were 200 cartridges for the six-pounder—the
long brass cartridge and the little shell all in one—and
three thousand rounds for the Maxim gun.  Then there
were the casks for the water, and a boat's stove to be
secured, and one of the <emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis> dinghies to be lashed
down amidships.[#]  We took the native boat, which you can
see in the picture hanging over the stern, so that we should
look more like an ordinary junk.  Then there was all our
own gear and boxes of biscuit and corned meat, and any
amount of stuff.  Dicky and I got heaps of things from old
Ah Man—jam, sardines, ginger-bread biscuits, and things
like that—and when we'd got them all into our little square
pigeonhole, and our sea boots, mackintoshes, greatcoats,
and a uniform tin case between us, there was hardly any
room left for our hammocks, and, of course, it wasn't
possible to stand up inside—it was much too low.  When
everything was ready we took her away to practise sailing,
and the Captain came with us, and was jolly pleasant,
and Mr. Whitmore, the Gunnery Lieutenant, came too,
and we tried the guns and, I must say, made very wretched
shooting.</p>
<p>[#] See page 77.</p>
<p>After that we had to wait for the gunboats to come back
from cruising, fill up with coal, and take us away in pairs.</p>
<p>The only thing that did make Dicky and me feel rather
sad was that Jim hadn't a junk all to himself.  But he
was going with Mr. Trevelyan, and as he was a splendid
chap, we knew that they would have a grand time together.</p>
<p>They called their junk the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>.  The Captain had said,
"Ferret 'em out for me, Trevelyan," so we all thought the
name was jolly appropriate.  They only had it painted on
the stern, not done with big wooden letters as ours was.
They had tried to use the rest of our gold leaf, but had
made a mess of the job and wasted it all, which was
rather a pity.</p>
<p>The Commander sent Mr. Langham a list of all the
fellows who were to go in the six junks, and he stuck
it on the notice board in the gunroom.</p>
<p>This is a copy of it, and will explain how they were
"told off", and who were to go in them.</p>
<p>


<emphasis>H.M.S. Vigilant</emphasis>,</p>
<p><emphasis>Tinghai Harbour.</emphasis></p>
<p>The six junks will be told off as tenders as follows:—</p>

completed with coal and provisions.</p>
<p>


CHAS. E. LESTER,</p>
<p><emphasis>Captain.</emphasis></p>
<p>We had nothing to do now but wait for the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>,
so Mr. Trevelyan took his junk and our junk the
<emphasis>Sally</emphasis> away sailing every day, till we really got quite good
at managing the clumsy gear and the huge matting sails.
We did some more gun practice as well.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> and <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> took their junks away before
our gunboat arrived, and we gave them a jolly good send-off.
At last our turn came, and the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> finished
coaling, and we were given orders to be ready to start at
daybreak.</p>
<p>The evening before we had to start there hadn't been
a breath of wind, and Dicky and I sat up whistling for
it till very late.  This was the first time we had spent
the night aboard, and we really couldn't sleep because of
the excitement and the fleas.  The wind did come by the
morning, but from the wrong direction, and the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>,
to save time, simply towed us away behind her.</p>
<p>It wasn't a very glorious start, but they gave us a
grand cheer, and the Captain had shouted, "Good luck,
Dick! pull your pound for the good old West Country,"
and that made me gloriously happy, because he had never
called me "Dick" since the first day I joined.</p>
<p>When we had got round the corner, out of sight of the
<emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and knew that we were in for any amount of
adventures, we felt simply ripping, and the sun came
out too, and we sat on deck and dried our things.</p>
<p>We were so close to the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> that we could talk to
Jim, and presently he came out of his "kennel"—he
called his a "kennel", and we called ours a "rabbit
hutch"—and yelled across to us to look.  He had a
huge cake in both hands.  "You've got one too, I
expect," he shouted, and we crawled into our hutch; and in
a corner, under the sea boots, was just such another, all
covered with icing, and "Chin Chin Joss from Ah Man"
scrawled on it in sugar.  Wasn't that jolly decent of the
old messman?  Of course we'd spent no end of money
getting sardines and jam and biscuit from him—those
sovereigns the Captain had given Jim and myself had
come in jolly useful—but we never expected anything like
this, and it just made us completely happy, and we had
a piece each on the spot, and waved across to Jim whilst
he and Mr. Trevelyan had slices too.</p>
<p>The pilot who came to us was named Ah Chee, a funny-looking
old chap, and I'm sure you wouldn't have guessed
his age within twenty years.  He could talk a little
"pidgin" English, and volunteered to do the cooking—in a
tiny little galley place over a brazier belonging to the
junk, and that boat's stove which we had fitted up—and
did it jolly well too, except when he'd been smoking too
much opium.</p>
<p>As I told you before, Scroggs was the name of one
petty officer, a fine great chap, and Sharpe, a fat,
good-natured little man, the other.  They were both jolly good
at their job, and the Commander had given us a good lot
of seamen too.</p>
<p>When it got dark they started a "sing song", and
Dicky and I each sang a song.  I sang "We'll rant and
we'll roar", and Dicky sang "Clementine", and we had
an awfully jolly time, and were just as happy as anything,
but for those wretched crawling and jumping things.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> towed us along for two whole days, and
on the morning after the second night Mr. Rashleigh had
towed us to wind'ard of the Chung-li Tao group of
islands.  He then stopped her engines and hauled us
alongside for orders.  We took our charts with us,
Mr. Trevelyan and I, and he told me I was to cruise to the
eastward and search all the channels, and rejoin him to
leeward of a certain island within four days—I forget the
name of the island; and he told us a lot more of what
we must do in case the weather or the wind changed,
but as he had written it all down, it was not necessary
to remember it.  Then he said goodbye, wished us good
luck, and his final orders were: "Keep your guns
covered up with old tarpaulins, don't let your people
show themselves when you're close to a village or a
junk, and don't attempt to look too smart.  Don't hoist
your sails as if you were in a blooming hurry, and if
you're not sure where you are, anchor for the night.
You're intended to be ordinary merchant junks, and you're
just bits of bait—sprats to catch a whale—and you have
to get hold of some of these fellows for the Captain, and
get 'em alive too—he doesn't want dead 'uns.  If you
meet more than you can tackle, just run down to me,
and," he added solemnly, "if other things happen, keep
one cartridge in your revolvers for yourselves."</p>
<p>That made me feel rather creepy and coldish, but not
exactly frightened, because Mr. Rashleigh is so plump
and so—well—funny looking that, however solemnly he
tried to say anything, you really wanted to laugh.</p>
<p>Just before we went away Dr. Hibbert, the jolly Surgeon
of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, gave Mr. Trevelyan and myself two
big wine bottles each.  They were marked "Foretop"
and "Maintop".  He winked cheerily at us: "You'll find
'em useful, you fellows.  If any of your chaps gets a pain
below the belt, shove in a big whack of the 'Maintop'
bottle; if he gets a pain above the belt, give him half a
dozen whacks of the 'Foretop'."</p>
<p>I marked mine "Above" and "Below", and stowed
them away very carefully in a corner.  He gave me some
tobacco too; for though I oughtn't to have smoked—I
wasn't eighteen—it was rather different when I was away
from the ship.  I had brought my pipe with me, but, like
an ass, had forgotten any tobacco.</p>
<p>Well, we shook hands and then off we went, the
"Ringdoves" cheering us, and all of us cheering each other.
She steamed off to the north'ard to get to leeward of
the islands, we went away towards the sun, and the
<emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> the opposite way, Jim waving from the poop and
sending a last "Luck to <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>!".</p>
<p>There was quite a good breeze blowing, and when we'd
got all our sails hauled up and the leeboard down, we
went flying along, heeling over till the lee gunwale raced
through and under the water.  It was simply grand.  The
sun came up too, and made it all the more cheerful,
although there wasn't much warmth in it, and when the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> had both got out of sight, Dicky
gave a great sigh of contentment.</p>
<p>I must say that, at first, I felt frightened at being alone,
and should have been jolly pleased to see the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis>
masts and funny little funnel sticking up over the horizon;
but presently I forgot to be nervous, because the junk
sailed so well, and it was simply ripping to be in
command, all by myself, with a six-pounder and a Maxim
gun, and all those two hundred shells down below, and
to think of the surprise we should give any junk which
tried to take us, because, you see, none of them had ever
known what a bursting shell was like.  There was Scroggs
to fall back upon too, if one really got into a tight fix and
couldn't make up one's mind.  He was such a huge chap,
that he could have lifted Dicky and me up with each hand;
but he would always talk about his missus and his "kids"
if we gave him the slightest opening, and—well—neither
Dicky nor I were the least enthusiastic about them after
the second day, and I'm quite certain that Sharpe felt
just the same—he had to live with him, too—because I
heard him say, "Now chuck it, if you don't want to drive
me off'n my blooming rocker."</p>
<p>To show you how the pirates had scared everything
off the sea, we never saw a single junk all those two
days we were being towed by the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and now we
had the sea all to ourselves.  Our first island was right
ahead, and we soon got up to it, and Ah Chee came
out of his pigeonhole and sniffed and looked, and sniffed
and looked again, and smiled, so we knew everything
was all right, from the "running-on-rocks" point of view.
I didn't tell you before, but Mr. Trevelyan had had a
great idea before we left Tinghai, and bought enough
loose-fitting blue Chinese short coats, and enough native
caps to go round his men and mine too; so now, as we
got quite close to the land, we made the men stick them
on, and Dicky and I put ours on, and looked jolly funny,
I expect.  I couldn't help thinking what my mother would
imagine had happened if she'd been able to see me rigged
up like this, and I was pretty sure that Nan would say
something to make me get red and angry.  But it was
grand fun, all the same.</p>
<p>We had one of the <emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis> dinghies, besides that native
sampan hung over the stern, and it had to be covered
up with a tarpaulin, so that its shape wouldn't show
through.  Good old Ah Chee seemed to understand our
game, and ran in quite close, and when we were nearing
a small village, began gesticulating and signing to me
to lower the sails a little.  "Too plenty quick—plenty
too quick—pilons thinkee you no got"—and he pointed
down to the hold, and I suppose meant "cargo"—"no
good makee catchee."  We lowered our mizzen altogether—it
wasn't doing much good anyhow—and slacked off the
sheets, and went past very slowly, Dicky and I looking
through our telescopes, and hoping to see something
coming after us.  There was nothing there, though, and
Ah Chee shook his head—"Too plenty good fellow can do."</p>
<p>One or two small junks were hauled up above high-water
mark, with their masts out—to make it all the
more difficult for pirates to carry them off, I suppose—a
few children were playing with the dogs and the pigs
on the shore, and one or two miserable wretches were
hauling in handlines and picking small fish off the
hooks—we could see them glitter in the sun as they wriggled.</p>
<p>Then Ah Chee signed to us to go faster, so we hoisted
the mizzen again, and hauled in our sheets and boomed
along.  We spent all that day doing this, running down
one channel and beating up another, and only once saw
any junks.  There were two beating to windward very
slowly, and when we sighted them Dicky and I were
very excited, and brought Ah Chee out to look at them.
He only shook his head and repeated, "Plenty good
fellow can do."</p>
<p>Dicky suggested that we should see how fast we could
sail and try and overhaul them, and we were getting on
finely, gaining every minute, though we could see them
doing their best to go faster; but presently Ah Chee, who
had borrowed my telescope, made us slow down, shaking
his head, "Plenty bad joss can do—if too plenty quick
go—him Chinaman," and he pretended to dive overboard.
Dicky understood what he meant first—that the
Chinaman would think us pirates, and would jump overboard
if we overhauled them, so we lowered our foresail,
just to comfort them, and eased down.</p>
<p>We had to keep under way that night, because the next
lot of little islands which we had to examine were about
nine miles away, and the breeze had fallen considerably.
I slept jolly soundly till midnight—I rolled myself in my
blanket and slept on deck, to escape the bugs under the
poop—and then relieved Dicky for the middle watch.</p>
<p>It was jolly cold, but the stars peeped out every now
and again, and it was just light enough to see rocks or
land a hundred yards ahead, so there was very little
danger of our running ashore.</p>
<p>It was the first night I had spent at sea under sail since
the Upton Overy days, and this made me think a lot of
the old village, and to wonder what they were doing at
home.  It was so jolly to know, after all the time—the
years, in fact—that I'd been longing to come to sea with
the Captain, that I was now doing quite an important
job for him, and that I might be lucky enough to help
him, and even be able to find Mr. Travers and Sally
Hobbs and her father.  It was grand, and I did so
enjoy myself that night, with, everyone, except myself and
the men at the helm and a lookout man for'ard, sound
asleep.</p>
<p>I had only the foresail and mizzen set, because there
was no reason for going fast, and I was rather nervous
about squalls.  You couldn't see them coming at night—at
any rate I couldn't, because I'd had so jolly little
experience.</p>
<p>I stood up alone on the poop, near the Maxim gun, and
kept my eye on the sails and the long, narrow deck below
me, and I don't know whether you will understand what
I mean, but I felt frightfully proud and conceited.  I'd
felt like that ever since we left the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, but I'd
done my best not to let it ooze out, for fear that Dicky
and the men should think me an ass, or too cocky, and
now it seemed to swell up from my boots, and gave me
an awfully funny feeling all over.</p>
<p>We sighted the island about six bells, and then I tacked
away again, as it was no use to go in close till daylight.
Scroggs relieved me at four o'clock, and I felt almost
sorry, but crept in alongside Dicky, as it was raining,
and went to sleep directly, without disturbing him.</p>
<p>It didn't seem many minutes before Scroggs woke me.
"The breeze is steady, sir, and the island's on our port
bow, and I think, sir, that something is following us and
just smelling 'around'."</p>
<p>I crawled out like a shot.  It was raining gently, and
the sails were all damp and dripping, but I couldn't see
anything at first except the long dark line of the island
to the east.</p>
<p>Scroggs pointed down to leeward, and I thought I
made out, just for a second, three great sails.</p>
<p>"She's there, sure enough, sir; I've seen her, off and
on, for the last half-hour, and she's working up to
wind'ard, as if she wanted to have a look at us."</p>
<p>I watched and watched, my heart thumping like mad,
and presently I caught sight of her dark sails again.</p>
<p>We went off on the other tack, and, sure enough, the
next time I saw her she'd done so too.</p>
<p>I knew then that she must be following us.</p>
<p>"She don't quite know what we are, sir," Scroggs
chuckled.  "She'll know a bit later."</p>
<p>Presently, as it grew lighter and she got closer, we
could see her all the time.  She looked huge in that
light, and had four masts and four immense sails, not
three, as we had thought at first.  She was heeling
over tremendously, sailing two knots to our one, and
overhauling us fast.</p>
<p>If you think that I was frightened you are jolly well
right.</p>

<p>"What shall we do?" I whispered to Scroggs.  "Go
down and have a look at her?"</p>
<p>"Beggin' your pardon, sir, you'll just keep straight on,
and edge a bit more up in the wind, if she'll do it.  Once
you've got the wind, sir, and can keep it, you can do about
what you like; keep away if you want to, run down to her
if you want to, and she'll have to do what you want her to,
and when you want her to."</p>
<p>Then I remembered reading all about fights in the old
time, and when we were in the <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>, and learnt about
actions in the old sailing days, how each side always
tried to get to wind'ard first, before fighting, and that
the man who was to wind'ard could fight or not just as
he pleased.  I'd never thought much of it before, but
now that Scroggs had put it so plainly, I saw, all at
once, how practically everything depended on having the
wind'ard position.</p>
<p>"How about giving her the mainsail?" I asked Scroggs.
"She's gaining very fast."</p>
<p>"She's doing all right, sir!  We doesn't want to run
away.  Just you edge up a bit more in the wind and
wait for her.  Time enough for the mains'l if she be a
pirate, and we have to chase her."</p>
<p>So we edged up into the wind again and began to
stand out to sea, beyond the island.</p>
<p>I pointed that out to Scroggs—I felt fearfully excited
and nervous.</p>
<p>"That's all right, sir, never mind about the island;
you'll be getting her out in the open, and she'll think
you're just trying to give her a wide berth."  Then I
remembered Dicky, and shouted through the little sliding
door for him to come and see the fun.  He scrambled
up on the poop, rubbing his eyes, and we both stood
looking at her, feeling frightened because she looked
so big and came on so like a ghost, and didn't notice
that we were getting wet through.  I did wish then
that the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> was in sight.</p>
<p>"How about letting the hands have food, sir?  Maybe,
if we've luck, we're like to be busy later on, sir!"</p>
<p>Of course Scroggs was right, and Dicky said that
Nelson always gave his men food before going into
action—he squeaked again, he was so nervous—and
that settled it; and the men were turned out, and were
almost too excited to eat anything.  Ah Chee was quite
stupid and silly when we tried to wake him—he must
have been smoking opium during the night—and the
men had to make their own cocoa.  Dicky and I managed
to gulp some down, and had a couple of gingerbread
biscuits each.  We didn't like looking at each other
for fear of giving away our—well—funk, though it
wasn't exactly funk.</p>
<p>By this time it was quite light, and the island was
about three miles away, right under our port bow, and
the huge Chinaman was about half a mile astern, and
still a little to leeward.</p>
<p>We dragged Ah Chee out of his hole again, but he
hadn't recovered, and staggered about, shaking all over;
and when he'd steadied himself, got both eyes to focus
properly, and seen the junk, he simply let out a howl
and crawled back, yelling "Pilons!  Pilons!" which made
me feel creepy, although I had to pretend it didn't.  I
had to pretend jolly hard.</p>
<p>"He'll kill himself with that pipe, sir, and we'll want
him later on," Scroggs said, but I didn't know what to do.
"You leave 'im to me, sir," and Scroggs dragged him out
again, took away his pipe and tobacco and opium, and
then shut him down in the forehold and jammed the hatch
cover over it.  Glad enough too he was to crawl into it.</p>
<p>The strange junk was coming up finely, heeling over and
splashing through the water.  We could only see one man
on board, standing on the poop watching us, and he
looked peaceable enough.</p>
<p>"She's got guns—I can see them sticking out!" Dicky
squealed; but that didn't make it certain that she was
a pirate, because all merchant junks carry guns too.
"Couldn't we go for her now, Scroggs, don't you think?
She isn't half a mile off."</p>
<p>Dicky and I were so excited and "quivery", we could
hardly breathe, and this waiting for her to catch up with us
was the worst part.  But Scroggs wouldn't alter course,
and said: "Just you 'oist the mains'l, sir, and get them
tarpaulins off the guns, and stand by.  When she sees
that 'ere mains'l creaking up, she'll guess we're frightened,
and maybe she'll let fly at us."</p>
<p>We got the tarpaulins off, and the men began working
the clumsy windlass which hoisted the mainsail, and the
great "clammy" thing went squeaking up the mast.
That made us go faster and heel over more.</p>
<p>The guns were all painted a dirty grey, so didn't show
up at all, but just what Scroggs had expected happened.
The junk all at once luffed up, shot up into the wind, came
on to an even keel, her great sails began flapping, we could
see men pouring up from below, and four white clouds of
smoke shot out from her port side, and before we could
say "knife", there were four splashes in the water behind
us, and one shot came ricochetting over us, humming like
a top, and fell into the sea ahead of us.</p>
<p>Dicky and I ducked, and then we looked up to see if the
ricochet had done any damage, and Scroggs pointed out
a hole in the mainsail, close to the mast, where it must
have gone through, and a piece of sail flapping down.</p>
<p>I'm certain that I wasn't frightened then, for I thought
more of the mast than myself, and knew what a bad
"egg" it would have been if the shot hadn't missed it.</p>
<p>I looked at Scroggs.</p>
<p>"Give 'em one, sir!  Give 'em one!" he was beaming
all over his face; "we can 'ardly miss 'er, sir."</p>
<p>I shouted for the six-pounder to open fire, but the mainsail
was in the way, and they couldn't get the sights on.</p>
<p>"Gun won't bear, sir," the captain of the gun shouted,
and I jumped for'ard to see for myself that he was right.</p>
<p>"What shall I do now?" I asked Scroggs, and felt
stupid, and could just see the pirate junk paying off
again to give us her other broadside.</p>
<p>She seemed so close that there wasn't time to think.</p>
<p>"Put your helm down and come into the wind yourself, sir."</p>
<p>I shouted to Dicky to do so, and the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> came up
all shaking.</p>
<p>"Now you've got her," Scroggs said, and as he spoke
the junk shot off her starboard guns, and we could hear
them yelling and beating tom-toms.  There was too much
to do this time to "duck", and besides, they had fallen
astern by luffing and then paying off again, so their shots
didn't come so close.</p>
<p>Then Fergusson, the captain of the six-pounder, fired.
The little shell burst as it touched the water halfway
across, and we heard the pirates yell again.  Scroggs let
out a dozen oaths, and told him to steady himself; and his
next went nearer, and the next burst close alongside, and
they didn't cheer that—they'd never seen shell burst before,
I expect, and wondered what it was, and how we could
fire so fast.</p>
<p>"Take your time," I shouted, and was so excited that I
bit a great piece out of my lip.  We fired again, and must
have hit her, for a cloud of smoke came out of her bows,
and a very different kind of yell came back, and we yelled
too; but she'd loaded again by this time, luffed up, and
gave us her port guns.  There was a crash and a whistling
sound, and out through the poop bounded a round shot,
struck against a big chock of wood at the foot of the
mainmast, and bounced overboard.  It only missed one of the
men at the tiller by a hair's breadth, and he let out a squeal,
he was so surprised, and then got red and tried to pretend
that it wasn't him.  "They're only smooth bores," Scroggs
shouted.  "Who's squealing like a furry rabbit?" and
Fergusson fired again—she wasn't four hundred yards
away—and missed her.  They started easing off rifles at
us too, and the bullets went splattering through the sails
and splashing into the water.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> had been jumping about up to now—that was
why Fergusson had kept on missing—but for just about
two minutes she was quite steady.  She almost seemed to
know things were not quite all right, and Fergusson must
have got off a dozen rounds, and nearly all of them hit.  I
was so excited, I yelled every time, and we could see smoke
coming out and pieces of wood flying, and though she
turned to give us her starboard broadside, she didn't fire
them, and fell right off the wind, with her stern facing us.
She wasn't three hundred yards off, and suddenly remembering
the Maxim gun, I rushed aft; but before I could
climb up the poop, Dicky turned out "trumps" and began
firing.  "Tut tut—tut tut," it went, and you could see
a lane of bullet splashes; and as we lifted our stern they
must have poured into her, and we heard shrieking, and
could see the Chinamen throwing up their arms and falling,
till the roll of the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> took the sights off again.[#]</p>
<p>[#] A Maxim gun is an extremely difficult weapon to use,
unless the gun platform is absolutely steady.</p>
<p>Then the signalman shouted, "They've had enough,
sir!" and we saw that they daren't turn round again,
and were easing off their sheets to run down wind.</p>
<p>You should have heard us cheer; and there wasn't
any need to tell the men at the helm to "hard a-starboard",
for they did it of their own accord, and we eased
away our sheets and ran after her.</p>
<p>"I thought he'd be sorry for it, sir," said Scroggs
coming up.  "Look up there, sir; that does one real
good."</p>
<p>I looked, and saw that we had the White Ensign flying
from the mizzen peak.  Dicky and I grinned with delight.
We'd been told not to hoist it—they'd not even given us
one—but there it was—grand!</p>
<p>"I did that, sir," the signalman said bashfully.  "Stole
it aboard the <emphasis>Vig.</emphasis>, sir," and he grinned, and everybody
grinned at everybody else, and looked to see what damage
that round shot had done, just for curiosity.</p>
<p>My aunt! we did just bubble through the water, half
burying our bows; the breeze must have freshened up
without our noticing it.  The pirate was digging out too,
and had got a good start, and it wasn't any use firing at
her, because we had a funny corkscrew rolling motion, and
couldn't be certain of hitting anything.  We only had
two hundred rounds of shell to begin with, so I didn't
dare to waste them, and waited till we could draw up closer
and make certain of hitting.  She was making straight for
the island, and at one time we thought that we must try
and disable her before she ran herself ashore.  Dicky and
I began to talk about capturing her.  We were little fools,
as it turned out.</p>
<p>Presently we saw that a channel opened out, right in
the middle of the island, and she was making straight
for it.  I got out our chart, but couldn't find the
island—not to make sure of it—so hauled Ah Chee out from the
forehold.  He was plucky enough now the pirate was
running away, and nodded his head and said, "Vely
good—vely good—plenty good," and pointed to the
channel, so I knew we were all right to follow her.</p>
<p>She was almost in it before we began firing at her,
and we hit her big square poop time after time, and
saw pieces of wood flying in the air; but it didn't seem
to make any difference to her, and she still kept on
steadily.</p>
<p>In another three minutes we shot into the channel
ourselves—between high cliffs—and as the tide was
running with us and the strong wind behind us, we
scooted along at a tremendous pace.  We were catching
her up fast, too, and had got to within two hundred
yards, and Fergusson began pouring in six-pounder
shells.  I really wanted to frighten her so much that
she would surrender, and I would be able to tow her
back to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and give her up to Captain Lester.
And I wanted to take back some of the crew as well,
for Captain Lester had told me, "Don't want dead 'uns;
dead 'uns don't tell things".</p>
<p>The noise our little gun made was tremendous, now
that we were in between high rocks.  You could hear
a crash! crash! and then a rolling sound and another
crash after every shot.  It must have frightened the
pirates, if it did nothing else; and whatever happened
I don't know, but we suddenly saw her main shrouds
on one side give way, her fore mainmast bent over like
a whip, and before they could do anything, down it came
with a snap, and the great sail with it, and the foremast
and foresail went too a moment later, and she simply
seemed to stop dead, turning her broadside to us and
unable to move—just like a huge bird with one wing
broken.</p>
<p>I had an insane idea of running alongside, but Scroggs
put our helm hard down, and we swung round like a top,
not fifty yards from her, and slid up into the wind.  I
rushed aft, furious with him.</p>
<p>"You'd have been atop of her in another second, sir."</p>
<p>"That's what I wanted," I said angrily.  "What d'you
mean by touching the helm?"</p>
<p>"Begging your pardon, sir, if you once got alongside,
we'd be done for!  She's got a hundred men aboard, and
we twelve wouldn't 'ave stood a chance."</p>
<p>But I was so excited, that I never thought of that, and
was just going to give him a piece of my mind about
his cheek, when the pirate let off his broadside right
in our faces.  We were so close that the noise seemed
to knock our ears in.  I was half stunned and dazed,
felt something hot all over me, and was thrown against
the mast.  I picked myself up, and found my hands and
my clothes covered with blood.  Scroggs was nowhere to
be seen, two of the Hotchkiss gun's crew were lying near
the gun groaning, and the dinghy had been smashed to
pieces.</p>
<p>Sharpe, the second petty officer, was bringing the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>
round into the wind again, and Dicky was busy with the
Maxim gun, but the six-pounder wouldn't bear—the
mainsail was in the way.</p>
<p>"Heaps of time, sir," Sharpe said, looking at me in a
funny way.  "They daren't go near their guns to reload
'em.  I thought you'd been killed, sir!"</p>
<p>"What happened?" I asked him, trying to shake the
blood from my face and eyes; I felt quite stupid.
"Where's Scroggs?"</p>
<p>"Scroggs is gone, sir.  One o' them round shot took
him in the middle, just as you were standing by, and
carried what was left of him overboard, and another
struck some of the six-pounder cartridges, and they
blew up and knocked over Adams and Cooke, and threw
you up ag'in that mast, sir."</p>
<p>Poor old Scroggs! and I'd been beastly to him too.
I have always been sorry for that.</p>
<p>Dicky gave a yell when he saw me.  He looked funny
about the eyes—rather mad—and burst out crying, just for
a second.  "I thought you'd been killed," he stuttered,
"and I've killed dozens of those brutes to revenge you."</p>
<p>I shouted something, and a funny hot kind of feeling
came up inside me, and the only thing I thought of was to
go on killing; and we edged up, just to leeward of the
junk, and fired at her with the six-pounder as fast as
Fergusson could load—Sharpe had sent him two more
hands, and had hauled Adams and Cooke aft, out of
the way.</p>
<p>Not a single live Chinaman could we see on deck—they'd
all gone down below out of sight—but every now
and again we could hear shrieks coming from inside her,
and knew that our shells were finding them out.  I felt
mad, and Dicky was mad, and only Sharpe kept his head.
We must have made some holes in her below the
waterline, because she was now much lower in the water, and
I simply longed to see her sink and drown all the
crew—I'd forgotten all about trying to capture her.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, as we were expecting her to go under,
someone pointed down to leeward, down the channel,
and, looking there, I saw four great junks beating up
towards us.  They were about a mile away, and had
covered themselves with pendants and streamers—all the
colours of the rainbow—and began firing guns to frighten
us, I suppose.</p>
<p>I went cold all over, for I knew we couldn't manage
four more, and I saw that Sharpe thought so too.  Dicky
didn't seem to be quite right in his head, for he shook his
fist at them, and yelled to me that there were more for him
to kill.  "Off out of it, sir; we can't tackle that lot.  We're
only nine all told, not counting orficers, sir.  Back again,
sir; beat up to wind'ard, sir; and get away into the open sea."</p>
<p>We hadn't a moment to lose, either, and I knew he was
right, and stood away from the sinking junk, and started
to beat up the channel, through which we had just entered.
The entrance was about half a mile to wind'ard of us, the
tide was against us, and jolly slow progress we made,
though I knew it was the same for those who were chasing
us.  We'd sailed so much more quickly than that sinking
junk, when we ran before the wind, that I hoped we should
be as good when we were beating; but I soon had a most
horrible feeling that we were not pointing so high as they
were, and not going so fast through the water, either.</p>
<p>We had time to look after Adams and Cooke now—Adams
had one thigh broken, and I knew that that
wasn't so bad; but Cooke had his hands and face and
legs all badly burnt with the explosion, and was in awful
pain.  We made them as comfortable as we could down
below under the poop, but it was horrid to hear Cooke
moaning and shrieking sometimes.</p>
<p>We soon got so close inshore that we had to go about
on the starboard tack, and we swung round and plugged
away for the entrance, which never seemed to get any
nearer.  The junks behind us were still gaining, two of
them very quickly.  These two were leaving the others
a long way astern, and just to show you what asinine
ideas come to one, I thought for a moment that we
might draw them on and on, till they were so separated
that we could tackle them one at a time.</p>
<p>The breeze had been gradually freshening, and was
now blowing down the channel quite hard, and as we
went off on the starboard tack, we heeled over till the
deck seemed almost upright (we were heeling over to
port—the left side).</p>
<p>But then an awful thing happened.  Suddenly, above
my head, there was a noise like a pistol shot, and,
looking up, I saw that one of the starboard main
shrouds had parted, and that the mainmast was
beginning to bend over.  If I held on for another minute,
the other two would be certain to go—the strain on
them was awful—and the mast would have gone too.
There was only one thing to be done, and I shrieked
to "Hard a-port!"  She heeled over, another shroud
uncurled and parted, but before the last could go she
staggered round into the wind, the strain was taken
off, and the mast straightened again.</p>
<p>Sharpe came running aft; he was as white as a sheet.
"It will take us an hour to repair, sir!  What can we do?"</p>
<p>It was plain as a pikestaff that we couldn't beat out.
Everyone on board knew that at once, and they all looked
to me, but knew what would have to be done just as well
as I did, and I could see them watching the pirates out of
the corners of their eyes.</p>
<p>The current was taking us down towards them, and
they were all coming along at a tremendous rate.  It was
no use drifting among them helplessly; we couldn't beat
out with only the mizzen and foresail, so the only thing to
do was to get before the wind again, with our sails out to
starboard, so that most of the strain came on our port
rigging, and try to run past them.  Clarke and another
man sprang up the mainmast, going up the big bamboo
hoops which kept the sail close to the mast, and began
reeving a temporary rope to act as a backstay, and we
swung round, gybed very carefully, and the little <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>
went bounding back to them.</p>
<p>The only one on board who wasn't—well—frightened
was Dicky.  He'd have charged an express train; he was
so mad with fighting and killing people with that Maxim.
We moved Cooke and Adams from under the poop, and
put them down below in the big hold, out of danger,
and by that time we were abreast the sinking junk;
and as we went rushing by she gave a lurch, we saw
her guns slide overboard, she went under, and we could
see at least fifty Chinamen struggling in the water.
Dicky yelled and shook his fist at them, and called
them all the names he could lay his tongue to.</p>
<p>I had tried to keep my eye on those four junks all
the time, and though I was still feeling "silly" after
being "bashed" against the mast, I could see that they
didn't seem to know quite what to make of us.  The
leading ones were half a mile ahead of the others, and
we were coming down so fast towards them that we
didn't give them much time to make up their minds.
We saw them run into the wind for a second or two,
and then they came along, on the other tack, straight for
us, the leading one about two hundred yards in front of
the second.  They were almost as big as the one we
had sunk, but only had three masts, so didn't look
quite so ferocious.</p>
<p>I thought that we could slip by and pass the first
two to port (our left-hand side), but as we got closer
it seemed to me that the first one was trying to ram
us, and I had sense enough to know that if she did,
our masts would probably go overboard, and that all
would be U P with us.  Sharpe was still up aloft,
reeving that temporary shroud, so I couldn't ask him
what to do, and began to feel very frightened.
Fergusson kept on firing the six-pounder very fast, and
kept on hitting her, but that didn't seem to have any
effect, and she didn't alter course.  We were hardly
fifty yards away now, and Fergusson let off that gun
faster than ever, and we could actually hear the shells
bursting and see the pieces of wood flying out of her
bows, and gashes opening out in her foresail.  Her
crew were yelling most awfully, and making such a
banging noise with tom-toms and brass clappers, that
that frightened me all the more.  We were simply
tearing along, with the water bubbling along the sides
like a mill stream.  We should be into her, or she into
us, in a moment, and I held my breath and clutched
hold of something, not knowing what to do.  The men
at the helm were looking at me for orders—they looked
scared, too—and I was just going to tell them to
"starboard", when I saw her begin to luff up.  I yelled to
them to "steady", and before you could say "knife",
she slid along our port side, with her huge sails leaning
right over us.  The horrid brutes were all hanging on and
glaring at us, and they shrieked and yelled, and I saw
some of them throw things at us, and some of them
fire off rifles.  She couldn't fire her guns, because she
was heeling over so much; but I knew she would let
them off directly she was on a level keel, and I saw
a lot of them scrambling over each other to get at
them, and knew they would fire almost directly—right
in our faces.  But as they slid past, like an express
train, Dicky began firing the Maxim right down in the
middle of them.</p>
<p>I shall never forget how they screamed and fell down
in heaps; and then, whether I gave the order or not
(Clarke said I did, but I think that the men who were
steering did it of their own accord), we put our helm
"hard a-starboard", and flew round under her stern.
Fergusson fired two shells straight into her poop, and
in their fright they let off their guns—right away from us.</p>

The battle between the Sally and the pirates</p>
<p>
<emphasis>The battle between the Sally and the pirates</emphasis></p>
<p>We put up our helm and flew away down wind, and left
her standing still, all her sails shaking, and in any amount
of confusion.</p>
<p>"Well done, sir!" Sharpe shouted from aloft, and that
seemed to wake me again, and Dicky and his Maxim gun's
crew were yelling with delight, and then everybody cheered
because the second junk wouldn't face us, but luffed up
and popped off her guns.  She was too unsteady, or too
much in a hurry, and we were going too fast, to give her a
chance of hitting us.  "Passed two of 'em, sir," Sharpe
sang out cheerily; "get those stink things overboard,
sir."  That was the first thing which made me notice that
I'd been coughing, and choking, and running at the eyes,
and that there was a horrid smell.</p>
<p>There was a round basketwork thing spluttering and
fizzing, and the beastly stinking smoke coming out of it,
lying jammed in a corner close to me.  I got it overboard
somehow, and heard it fizzle as it fell in the water—ugh! the
stink was awful.  The others which had come on
board were got rid of somehow or other—the men had
thrown them or they had rolled overboard—but everyone
was coughing and wiping their eyes, especially the
six-pounder gun's crew, who were to leeward, and so had got
most of the smoke.</p>
<p>When I could see out of my eyes properly, there was
Dicky grinning at me from the poop, and I did really
think, at the time, too, that he must have either gone off
his head or was actually enjoying himself.  The two junks
which we had passed were coming along after us now;
the first one was a long way astern, and the second broad
on our port quarter.  Fergusson had got the smoke out of
his eyes too, and began banging at this cowardly second
one; and we could see that she was trying to edge away
out of range of his shells.</p>
<p>But now we were rushing down towards the last two
junks.  They were lashing along on the port tack, heeling
over till we could almost see their keels, and were coming
straight towards us on the other side—to starboard (our
right-hand side).  I couldn't see them at all from the high
poop because our sails were in the way, so went down
close to the men steering, and could then see them by
looking under the foot of the mainsail.  Sharpe came
and stood by me, and I didn't feel so nervous.</p>
<p>The nearer one was about a hundred yards off.</p>
<p>"Wait a little, sir!  Wait a little!" Sharpe said.  We
were both peering under the sail, and Dicky had gone
for'ard to see if he could get the six-pounder to fire.
"When she's a leetil bit closer, turn away from her, sir."</p>
<p>There was only fifty yards between us now, and we were
rushing to meet at a point.</p>
<p>Thirty yards!  Twenty yards!  I couldn't breathe.
They yelled and shook their arms about; we could see
them all clinging to the weather gunwale.</p>
<p>I looked at Sharpe.  "Now, sir!" he cried, and I sang
out, "Starboard!" and our bows slewed away from her.</p>
<p>"Haul in the sheet, sir!  Quick, sir! or she'll be on to
us and carry away the sails," and everyone jumped to the
sheets and began hauling in the huge booms of the foresail
and mainsail.  The <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> heeled over, with the wind on her
beam, and seemed almost to give a leap through the water.
We thought that we should just shoot past the third junk,
and were going to cheer, but the next thing I knew (the
sails hid her now) there was a bump, and the junk suddenly
appeared right on top of us.  I was flung down—we all
were—the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> seemed to rebound, and there was another
crash under her poop.  I bent my head down, expecting
the masts and sails to come toppling on top of me; but she
must have only struck us grazing blows, because they
didn't, and when I looked up again we had cleared her.
"For God's sake, ease off those sheets!" Sharpe yelled,
"or we'll gybe," and I had enough sense left to know
that if we did gybe we should either capsize or carry away
all our damaged starboard main rigging and lose our
masts.  The men at the helm scrambled to their feet, and
had enough wit left to "starboard" a little.  The sails
were just shaking, uncertain whether they would swing
right across to port, but that extra bit of starboard helm
just did the trick and saved her.  They were all too busy
with the sheets to fire the Maxim or the six-pounder,
and the next I knew was a roaring hot noise right in our
faces—she had fired her broadside at us.  My head and
ears seemed banged in, and I shut my eyes, wondering
where I should be hit.  Then I heard Sharpe yell,
"Mr. Morton's down, sir!" and I opened them to see Dicky lying
on the deck where the dinghy had been, with his face and
head covered with blood.  I forgot about everything else,
and jumped across to him, and tried to stop the blood with
my dirty handkerchief, and make him say something; but
Sharpe sang out, "For God's sake, sir, look where you're
going!" and I heard the most awful noise of yelling under
our port bow, and there was the fourth junk, towering
above us and rasping along our side.  I was knocked over
again.  I saw some iron things, like grapnels, thrown on
board, with ropes fastened to them.  One near me caught
in the starboard gunwale, but jerked itself free; another
missed the main rigging, but two caught somewhere on the
poop, and I could see the lines on them tautening and the
pirate junk turning after us, to ease the strain.</p>
<p>There was a horrid feeling that the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> wasn't going
so fast.  Sharpe rushed past me with an axe in his hand,
and I found myself on the poop next to him.  He was
hacking away with all his might, and cut through one
rope; but there was the other grappling iron, caught in the
damaged woodwork, and it had about six feet of chain
secured to it, and he couldn't break that.  He hacked and
hacked, and we all tried to pull the grappling iron itself
free, but couldn't move it, because the crew of the junk
were hauling on the rope at the other end of the chain,
and there was a tremendous strain on it; the rope and
chain were as taut as a bar.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>
"HE HACKED AND HACKED"</p>
<p>
<emphasis>"HE HACKED AND HACKED"</emphasis></p>
<p>I can't quite tell you what happened for the next few
seconds; they seemed like years.</p>
<p>The third junk was firing her broadside guns, and the
one that had got hold of us was firing rifles; and we were
covered with smoke, and could hear woodwork smashing
somewhere all round us, and how it was we were not all
killed I don't know to this day.</p>
<p>"I can't do it; God help us, sir!" Sharpe groaned, and
left off hacking at the chain, and began to try and cut away
the side of the poop where the grappling iron had fixed
itself; but the edge of the axe was all blunted, and would
hardly even cut wood.  It was perfectly awful, and you
could see the cruel brutes in the bows of the fourth junk
hauling in the rope, hand over hand.  They thought that
they had caught us, and were making the most tremendous
noise, shouting and yelling.</p>
<p>They had hauled themselves to within twenty feet of us,
and would be alongside in another few seconds.  We
could see them crowding for'ard, waving swords, and
getting ready to pour on board.  They began throwing
stink balls, too, but these fell into the water, or, at any
rate, we were too terrified to notice them.</p>
<p>I suddenly wondered why the Maxim wasn't working—I'd
not thought of it—and looked round and saw why.  It
was all battered in a heap, and two of its crew were lying
underneath it.</p>
<p>I don't know what I did, or quite what happened then,
but I found myself under the poop, hunting among all the
wreckage for my revolver.</p>
<p>I didn't find it, but got hold of a cutlass and was
rushing up again, when I heard Sharpe give a yell of joy,
and was just in time to see that awful rope "part", and
the people in the bows of the pirate junk fall on their backs
in a heap.</p>
<p>"We're away, sir!" Sharpe shouted, and, darting for'ard
to the six-pounder, sang out to the men steering to turn
her round a little, and fired four times right into the pirate's
bows.</p>
<p>They came round, too, and fired their guns at us; but we
were beyond worrying about gunshots now, after all we'd
been through, and paid off again before the wind, the third
and the fourth junks following us close behind, and the first
two a long way behind.</p>
<p>My head was simply going round and round, and my
ears were ringing and buzzing.  We were still in a cloud
of powder smoke from the junks, and our poop was a
perfect wreck.</p>
<p>I had time to look round now—the Maxim gun was lying
there, knocked to pieces, the two men near it were quite
dead, horribly smashed up one was, and there was hardly
an undamaged plank to be seen.  The native boat hanging
over our stern had been smashed to pieces, and the
wreckage of it was trailing in the water.  We cut it
adrift.  Bits of wood and sail and rope were lying all
over the decks, and up above our sails were full of holes.
The main gaff was hanging down and beating against the
sail, and tearing long strips out of it; but the mast still
stood, and the rudder wasn't damaged, and we were simply
roaring through the water again.</p>
<p>Then the third junk began creeping up on our starboard
quarter, not overhauling us very fast, which showed that
our speed wasn't much decreased; and directly the
six-pounder would bear, Sharpe, who had taken charge of it,
began firing into her, and hit her several times.  We could
see her trying to edge away.</p>
<p>Right astern was the fourth junk, and half a mile
astern the first and second.  The third and the fourth kept
on yawing, so that they could bring their guns to bear and
fire at us, but lost ground doing this, and only made a few
more holes in our sails.</p>
<p>My people began to cheer—the seven who were left—because
the open sea showed right in front of us; and
then they cheered more loudly, because the first junk,
which seemed to be very low in the water, suddenly shot
up into the wind, the second junk, which had always given
us a wide berth, followed her, and both of them began
tacking over to the island.</p>
<p>That left us only two to tackle—the fourth, which was
about three hundred yards astern, and the third, which was
broad on our starboard quarter, but was edging away to
try and get out of range of Sharpe's little shells, and was
quite out of it, as far as her own guns were concerned.</p>
<p>But before she could get out of range, something
happened which made her gybe badly—we were all running
before the wind, you must remember.  Whether Sharpe
had smashed her steering gear or not, I don't know, but, at
any rate, she lowered her foresail and hauled into the wind
as if to repair something, and lost a great deal of ground
before she paid off, and came after us again.</p>
<p>Something, whatever it was, must have been very badly
damaged, for she hauled her wind again; and the fourth did
so too, sailing close up to her, and then—hurrah! how we
cheered!—they both began beating to wind'ard towards the
island, and we were left alone.</p>
<p>I don't know how the men felt, but I felt giddy and weak
and horribly sick, and had to hold myself up against the
mizzen mast, because my knees trembled so much, and
my head was splitting, and my mouth felt absolutely dry,
and my ears were all buzzing and humming, and very
painful.</p>
<p>I jumped down to Dicky; he was lying just where he'd
fallen, and he was quite unconscious, and had an awful
gash across the side of his head.  Some splinter must have
struck him.</p>
<p>The signalman said he knew something about "first
aid", and brought the "first aid" bag, and bandaged him
up, and wiped the blood off his face, and we brought him aft.</p>
<p>Please don't think that I was cool enough to have
written this down right on the spot.  I couldn't possibly
have done it.  Everything went so fast, that you had
no time for thinking, and really, after being thrown
against the mainmast, when Adams and Cooke had been
injured, I wasn't any use at all.</p>
<p>I was shaky and "jumpy" for days afterwards, and
it wasn't till I got back to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> that I could write
this down, and then I had to get everyone who was on
board the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> to help me.</p>
<p>It was Scroggs, and after he was killed, Sharpe, who
had done it all, and but for them—well—I shouldn't have
been able to write about it, or any of us either, for the
matter of that.</p>
<p>And if, after Scroggs and Sharpe, you asked me to
tell you who did next best of the men, I should say
the two able seamen who stood to the tiller ropes and
steered for that horribly long hour, and did things—right
things—at the proper time, even without orders.
They hadn't had the excitement of firing back, either, to
keep them keen and from getting in a funk.  One was
John Corder, and the other William Young, and they
both got their ratings as leading seamen some time
afterwards, and I only wish that my father were a rich man,
and could do more for them.</p>

<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>It must have been some time between seven bells and noon
when we found ourselves clear of that hateful channel and
the smoke that seemed almost to fill it, and the last of the
pirates had given up the chase.  We hadn't even enough
energy to cheer, but we all wanted to lie down.  Not a
single one of us had escaped bruises or cuts from bits
of splinters, and I know that I felt almost dead, as if
I'd been bruised all over—being thrown against the mast,
when poor old Scroggs was killed, did that.</p>
<p>I would have let the men sleep, but Sharpe shook his
head and said that there was too much work to be done,
and of course he was right.  All the wounded had to
be looked after, and the rigging and sails to repair
temporarily.  When we'd got well away from the island,
we found that the wind had begun to go round to the
west, and what bothered us most was a plank, under
the starboard side of the poop, which had been smashed
in when the third junk collided with us.  The breeze
going round to the west was good, because it brought
all the strain on our port rigging, and the fore and
main rigging on that side hadn't been injured; but it
was bad for us, because it made us heel over to
starboard, and this smashed plank kept on going under
water and letting a lot in.</p>
<p>We had to turn the Sally round into the wind and lower
her sails, and stayed like that for nearly an hour, all the
time looking to see whether any junks were coming after
us, and standing by to scoot off again if they did.  But
none tried to follow us, and when Sharpe had nailed some
canvas and some of the dinghy's broken planks over the
hole, we hoisted our sails again and sailed away for the
island where we had to meet the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Ah Chee was plucky enough now, and began to cook
something hot for us all over the big brazier.  It had
been knocked over and emptied, but there were so many
bits of wood lying about, that he made a fire out of them.
He kept pointing to himself and jabbering, "Ah Chee
belong plenty blave fightee man," and then to the island,
shaking his fist, "Pilons all same pig."</p>
<p>I had crawled under the poop to look at Dicky.  I was
almost afraid to go there, because I thought I should
find that he had stopped breathing; but I watched him
very carefully, and could just see his chest moving, and
his lips too sometimes, when he breathed in and out.
I crept back again, feeling very funny and glad.  Adams
and Cooke were moaning and groaning, and it was awful
not to know the proper thing to do for them.  Sharpe had
wrapped the two dead men in their blankets and put them
down below out of sight, and we had put Adams and
Cooke and Dicky in the men's part of the poop, because
all the upper part, where Dicky and I and Scroggs and
Sharpe had lived, was simply a wreck.  My hammock and
bedding had been carried halfway through the bulkhead by
a shot, which was still fixed in it, and my uniform tin case
was almost doubled in half, and I couldn't open it.  I know
that you will think me an ass, but when I found Ah Man's
cake, with only a gash across the icing, I could have
whooped with joy, and divided it among the men, leaving
a bit for Dicky, if he ever got well—I knew he wouldn't
mind.  That was the first thing we had to eat after the
pirates left off chasing us.  You should have seen us drink.
I had never been so thirsty in my life, nor the men in theirs
either, I should fancy.</p>
<p>Our compass had been smashed, but we could guess our
course roughly, and Ah Chee knew his way pretty well
among the islands, so we didn't worry much about that.</p>
<p>We were really too "played out" to worry about anything.
By the middle of the afternoon it was blowing very
hard, and we were plunging, and shaking, and heeling
over so much, that we had to lower the mainsail altogether,
and could only carry the foresail hoisted halfway
up, and the little mizzen sail.  That eased her, and made
her much more comfortable, and I should have let the
men go to sleep, but Sharpe wouldn't hear of it.  "No,
sir.  It's going to be a dirty night, and we'd best set
up that damaged rigging tempor—arily."  So he and
the four hands—all that were left, if you don't count
the two men at the tiller—worked wearily away till it
was nearly dark.</p>
<p>But long before that I'd gone to sleep myself.  I was
very ashamed then, and am still ashamed of myself; but I
had got into a corner, more or less out of the wind and
the spray, propped up between the poop and the side
of the junk, close to the men at the helm, and must
have simply gone to sleep standing up, and slipped down
without knowing it.</p>
<p>"The <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> is in sight, sir!" I suddenly heard, and
there was Sharpe standing over me, and trying to shake
some life into me.  "She's asking for news."</p>
<p>I hardly dared look at him, because I felt such a
"worm", and got on my feet again.  At first I thought
he meant the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, but it was only Mr. Trevelyan and
Jim in their junk.  Oh!  I felt so stiff and sore, and had
to rub my eyes to get properly awake; but then I was
frightfully glad, for I thought that Mr. Trevelyan might
know something about doctoring.  She was slanting down
towards us, with only a bit of her mainsail hoisted, and
flying some signal.</p>
<p>"We've given her our name, sir," the signalman said,
"and now Mr. Trevelyan wants to know what news you
have, sir."</p>
<p>I told the signalman what to say, and he semaphored,
"Captain to Captain" (that didn't even make me smile, or
feel proud, so proves how tired I must have been).  "We
have sunk one pirate junk, and escaped from four more in
the channel between East and West Nam Chau Islands"
(we had found the name on the chart, after all).  "Petty
officer Scroggs killed, two able seamen, Midshipman
Morton and able seaman Cooke badly wounded, and able
seaman Adams has leg broken."</p>
<p>We saw them take it in, and I knew how unhappy
Jim would be about Dicky.  Then they hoisted a signal
which meant "heave to", and we lowered the bit of
foresail and swung round, with our mizzen to keep us
in the wind, whilst Mr. Trevelyan came lurching down,
swung up into the wind just ahead of us, lowered his
mainsail, and hoisted a tiny bit of mizzen.  I could see
them all looking at us, and Jim was standing on the poop
waving to me, and I waved back to him.  They got out
their dinghy and two men, and Mr. Trevelyan began
dropping down towards us.  We threw them a rope and they
caught it, swung in under our stern, and Mr. Trevelyan
clambered up over our poor old wrecked poop.  It was
a jolly tricky thing to do, because a big sea was running.
I was so awfully "done up", that I could almost have
burst into tears when I saw him.  I was never so
thankful to see anyone in my life before.</p>
<p>"Holy Moses!  Ford, you've been and smashed up the
Skipper's junk, and no mistake!  My jumping Jupiter! you
must have had a warm time, and you look like a blooming
butcher yourself."</p>
<p>"It's not mine, sir," I told him; "it's Scroggs's."  I had
been too tired to wash my face and hands and my clothes,
and the spray hadn't done it either; it was all caked and
brown by now.  I implored him to come and see Dicky
and Adams.  "I don't know a blooming thing about doctoring,"
he said, scratching his head, and looking awfully
serious; but he picked his way across the smashed-up poop,
and where the Maxim gun had been, and we crawled in
to see Dicky.  He was still unconscious; he wouldn't even
look at me, though his eyes were open, and we shouted
his name, and every time the junk flopped about, both
Adams and Cooke moaned terribly.  Mr. Trevelyan did
make it more comfortable for them all, because he made
us roll Cooke in blankets, so that his legs did not stick
together, and he made us tie Adams's legs together to
keep the broken one steady; and then we put them in
their hammocks and slung them, somehow or other, and
after that it didn't hurt them so much when the junk
rolled and pitched.</p>
<p>All this time I had told Mr. Trevelyan everything, just
as I have told you, and he was fearfully excited, and
made us show him on the chart exactly where we had
been, as far as I could make out.  "You have had luck,"
he kept on saying; "and I'm going to have a go at
them."  You see, I hadn't really got any information—none
worth having—and no prisoners.  I had been much
too excited to notice anything on the islands themselves,
and, as Mr. Trevelyan said, "They might have their
whole bally 'fit out' there."</p>
<p>"Don't bother about that, you lucky little beggar"
(I suppose I looked miserable); "you can't do every
blessed thing!  Now you shove along to the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>,
and I'll beat up to your pirates, if my crazy old 'ditcher
will face it—she won't sail for nuts, Ford—and just 'makee
look see' first thing in the morning.  Give old Rashleigh
my love, and if I'm not back again by to-morrow night,
or the morning after, get him to come along and pick
up the scraps."</p>
<p>He was just as excited as you can imagine.  I wanted
him to take back all the Maxim ammunition I had left—of
course it was no use to me now—and he jumped at
the idea, and we hauled the dinghy under the stern and
passed the boxes, with the unused cartridge belts, into her.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> had dropped down to leeward of us, so that
he would not have to pull back to wind'ard; I don't think
he could have done so even if he had tried.  "Goodbye,
my sucking Nelson; keep your pecker up, and I'll give
'em 'beans' in the morning," he said as he slid down
into the dinghy.  He was always so awfully cheerful and
"buckish".  "What d'you think of Dicky?" I asked him
before he let go.  "I'm jiggered if I know!" he shouted.
"Get him to the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and Hibbert as quickly as you can."</p>
<p>He was just casting off, when he happened to look up,
and sang out to the bow man to hold on.  He had seen
our white ensign, and shouted out to me: "I say, Ford,
let me have that, there's a good chap; you'll have no
more fighting, and I'd like it so much."  I had it hauled
down and passed it into the dinghy, though the
signalman wasn't half pleased.</p>
<p>Back he went, alongside the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>.  I saw the flag
and ammunition boxes and then the dinghy hoisted on
board, a man hauled himself up the mizzen and made
the flag fast there, and then she hoisted part of the
mainsail again and began to pound away back to our
islands.  We cheered her and she cheered us, and the
last shout I heard was a "tiger" from Jim.</p>
<p>Then I hoisted the foresail halfway up, and off we
went again; and by this time it was nearly dark, and
we soon could only make out where the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> was by
the white splash when she flopped down on top of a sea,
and in a very few minutes we couldn't even see that, and
felt awfully lonely.</p>
<p>I should never have found the way back, and I don't
think that Sharpe would have done so either, but for Ah
Chee.  He was a grand chap, when there wasn't any
fighting to be done, and seemed to know every island
we passed that night, and just where we could trust
ourselves.</p>
<p>Sharpe and I had to be on deck nearly all night, it was
blowing so hard, and of course there were those islands
to avoid.  Sharpe wouldn't leave off talking about Scroggs
and the family he had left behind him, and that made it
more miserable still, that and hearing Adams and Cooke
groaning, and knowing that Barton and Hicks, the two
men who were killed, were lying down in the hold.  We
got a little lee from one of the islands some time during
the middle watch, so then we made better weather of it.
It must have been soon after that when Sharpe woke
me—I had fallen asleep again.</p>
<p>"Who's that?" he cried, his voice all of a shake, and
I listened, and all of a sudden could hear someone singing
out "Dick" from under the dark poop.  All the blood
rushed to my head, and I could have blubbed with
delight, for it was Dicky's poor little bleating voice; and
I crept in with a lantern, picked my way over the men
asleep, held up the lantern, and there he was looking at
me and asking for a drink.  Well, I did blub then—just
for a second—and don't mind saying so, I was so happy,
and went and found a little water and gave it to him; and
Sharpe stirred up the hot bits of wood in Ah Chee's brazier,
which the wind had kept glowing, and we warmed some
tinned milk and gave that to him.  When he'd drunk it
he turned over and went to sleep, without asking anything,
only just saying, "Thank you".</p>
<p>Still, that was enough, and I do believe that Sharpe was
a little bit husky too; and I wanted him to let me shove
on a little more sail, so that we could get back to the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> all the more quickly, but he wouldn't let me
do it.  "She's carrying all she can do with, sir, and the
men are asleep."  He was right, too, because we should
have had to turn them out to hoist more sail.</p>
<p>Ah Chee knew all right where he was going, and at
daybreak we sighted the island at which we had to meet
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and two hours later saw her three masts
and her funny little funnel sticking up.</p>
<p>I had signalled across all my news, and you can imagine
how thankful I was to run the Sally alongside her, and
to see Dr. Hibbert clambering on board us over her
"nettings", smoking his pipe and looking jolly.</p>
<p>"Find my medicine stuff any use?" he asked me.</p>
<p>"Both bottles were broken, sir," I told him, "so I
hadn't the chance," and took him under the poop, and
a lot of men came and hoisted all three of the wounded
on board the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Dicky woke up and managed a bit of a smile as they
took him away, but he was still dazed and half silly.
They took Hicks's and Barton's bodies on board too,
and before we went off again buried them overboard.</p>
<p>Then Mr. Rashleigh sent for me.  He was angry that
I hadn't reported to him directly I had come alongside.
I told him all that had happened, and how Scroggs had
done nearly everything, and when he'd been killed, how
Sharpe had practically done everything, and how
Mr. Trevelyan had taken all my Maxim ammunition and
gone back to have a look at the pirate place himself.
The last bit seemed to make him jolly angry, and he
muttered something about "confounded disobedience".</p>
<p>The wind, too, had gone round to almost due north,
so that Mr. Trevelyan couldn't possibly get back for at
least three days.</p>
<p>"That ass Trevelyan would put his head into a lion's
mouth, if he thought he could get any news there," he
said, and swore angrily.  "I'll have to go and haul him
out by the feet, and hope the pirates won't have snapped
his head off.  If they haven't, I will."</p>
<p>We had to go back with him, he couldn't leave us
there, and as soon as his people had set up some more
rigging, and done a bit more to make our poop water-tight,
and the stern as well, we had to follow the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> back
again.  It was a fair wind for us, and we didn't delay her
very much.  Mr. Rashleigh had offered to let me sleep
aboard his gunboat, in order that I could get a good rest;
but I had had a jolly good feed in the ward room, and had
had a bath, so this made me rather angry.  "Just as you
like; I don't care a tuppenny biscuit," he said, and gave
me another petty officer to take Scroggs's place, so at
last Sharpe was able to get a little sleep.</p>
<p>I must say that I felt frightened about Jim and
Mr. Trevelyan, because neither of them would have thought
twice of taking on all the pirates in the world; and they
had already had nearly thirty hours to themselves, and
I wondered what had been happening.  By noon next
day we were two miles off the islands, and the channel
from which we had escaped; but we had heard or seen
nothing of the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>, and thought that we might possibly
have passed her beating back to the rendezvous during
the night.</p>
<p>Presently someone shouted that they thought they had
heard the noise of a gun.  Everyone listened, and in a
few minutes we could hear three sharp bangs.  "That's
the <emphasis>Ferret's</emphasis> six-pounder," someone said, and we were all
frightfully excited.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> signalled us to follow as fast as
possible—she had heard them also—and shoved on for all she
was worth.</p>
<p>She had all her little sails set, and smoke was pouring
out of her funnel.</p>
<p>We saw her enter the channel, half a mile ahead of us,
and just as she got into the mouth of it, two clouds of
white smoke jumped out from the left-hand side, down by
the water's edge, we saw two great splashes of water leap
up behind her stern, and then came the roar.  If you've
never heard the roar of a gun, it's awfully difficult to
describe it; but with cliffs all round, you can hear the
noise smashing up against them with a crash, and rolling
about and crashing again.</p>
<p>"They've got some guns there, sir!  Now we've got
some information as will please the Captin, sir, when he
hears of it, sir, eh?" and Sharpe winked at me.</p>
<p>We kept our eyes glued on the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and saw that
she was clearing for action.  I have always thought that
Mr. Rashleigh might have done that before; and the two
guns had reloaded before he could commence firing, and
they plugged in two more shots.  "One's hit her," the
signalman sang out, "close to the foremast, sir."  But
she didn't seem to be badly damaged, and started off
with her four-inch guns (three she had on each side, one
on the poop, one in the waist, and one on the fo'c'stle).
They made an awful noise in the narrow channel; and
we could also hear the rattle and see the spurts of smoke
from under her bow and stern, and knew that she was
working her Nordenfelt machine guns.  "They're digging
up the ground all round them pirates' guns," one of
my men sang out, though, as far as I could see, most
of the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> shells were falling in the water—at first,
at any rate.</p>
<p>I couldn't find the guns, but soon the "Ringdoves" made
better shooting, and I could then spot them.  Just as I
had spotted them they fired again.  "Short," yelled a
man.  "Two hundred over," another shouted.</p>
<p>"They're too much bothered by those 'Ringdoves' to
do much aiming, sir," Sharpe said very coolly.  Then I
began to wonder what would happen whilst we were
passing them, and whether the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> would wait for
us.  She didn't, however, and you can imagine how
frightened I was to see her steaming away out of range,
and cease firing, after the shore guns had fired another
round at her, which fell a long way astern.  She was
almost hidden in powder smoke too.  "They'll just have
time to reload before we get abreast of them," I said to
Sharpe; and I don't mind telling you that I felt in a
horrid funk, and, if there had been no one to know
anything about it, should have turned the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> round
and run away.</p>
<p>"All right, sir!" Sharpe said; he didn't look frightened.
"Keep her across as far as you can, and send all of 'em
who aren't wanted down below.  Mr. Rashleigh will be
back in a minute."  He took charge of the six-pounder,
with one man to help him load, and, "my eye!" he did let
off quickly.  I sent everyone else down below into the hold
except Fergusson and another man, who looked after the
tiller tackles, and went amidships myself and stared at
those two guns reloading—I couldn't take my eyes off
them—and—and—then they began slowly to train round,
till I could only see the black muzzles pointing straight
at us, with Sharpe's little shells bursting on the ground
in front of them.  I've told you how frightened I was,
so I must tell you that I did not get behind the
mainmast.  I would have done anything to get there, but
something inside me prevented me, and I have been
awfully proud that I didn't, ever since.</p>
<p>It's bad enough standing behind a big gun and waiting
for it to go off, but it was awful standing in front of two;
and I felt that they couldn't possibly help hitting me—to
say nothing of the junk—because, although we had crept
over to the far side of the channel, we were only about
four hundred yards away.  Then off they went, the smoke
and the flashes and the roar, Sharpe's yell, "Look out,
sir!" a crash somewhere in our poop, and another crash
up above; all seemed to come together.</p>
<p>"The tiller's smashed, sir!  We can't steer," Fergusson
shouted, and I saw that one side of the poop had been
blown clean out, and the whole of the upper part of
the mainsail had fallen down, and the top of the mast
with it.</p>
<p>Sharpe rushed aft and cut the mizzen halyards, and
down that sail came.  You must understand that we
were sailing very fast before the wind, and, of course,
if we had only the foresail set, we should have blown
along in more or less of a straight line, but the mizzen
made us yaw from side to side.</p>
<p>This steadied the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> a little, and we were going to
lower the rest of the mainsail too, when there was a
tremendous roar, and the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> came splashing back,
in between us and the guns, with all her sails flat
"aback", and she didn't give those guns a chance to
fire again.  She ran in quite close, and we could see
men running away from them; and then round she turned,
still firing, and followed us as we staggered this way and
that way up the channel.</p>
<p>"Lower that cursed fores'l or you'll be ashore,"
Mr. Rashleigh shouted, "and we'll take you in tow."  Jolly
coolly he did it, too, and everyone hauled in the grass
hawser and made it fast.</p>
<p>In five minutes we were out of range.</p>
<p>"What the furies is the matter?" he shouted from the
poop.</p>
<p>"First shot carried away our tiller," Sharpe shouted.</p>
<p>"Anybody hurt?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," he answered.  I was too excited to shout.</p>
<p>Still there wasn't a sound or sight of Mr. Trevelyan's
junk, and we went very slowly up the channel, almost as
far as where we had sunk that first pirate junk.</p>
<p>Then all of a sudden we could hear the six-pounder
banging away somewhere on our left, and the tut—tut,
tut—tut of the Maxim, and in a little opening in the rocks
I caught sight of the white ensign I had given Mr. Trevelyan,
against the dark shore, and could make out the
<emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> herself, jammed at the foot of some rocks, and
people on board waving their arms.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> had spotted her as well, and we all
cheered and steered straight across towards her—at any
rate, the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> steered and we were towed round—and
the gunboat dropped her anchor about a hundred yards off.</p>
<p>The poor little <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> was all over to port.  She had
only her mizzen mast standing, and was evidently hard and
fast on the rocks, right in the middle of a small creek.</p>
<p>Mr. Rashleigh went across in the whaler at once, and
as he got close to her we could see his boat's crew pulling
very fast, and noticed some bullet splashes round the boat,
and the <emphasis>Ferret's</emphasis> Maxim spluttered out.  We couldn't see
what they were firing at, and it was most exciting.</p>
<p>"Mr. Trevelyan, he's bottled 'em, sir; that's what he's
done, sir," Sharpe said.  He was busy repairing the tiller,
and going about the job as if he was on board the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>
at Hong-Kong, or Portsmouth, or anywhere else where
there was no chance of a scrap.</p>
<p>Well, that was just what it turned out to be.
Mr. Trevelyan had fetched the mouth of the channel the
morning after he had left me, hadn't been fired at by the
battery, but had coolly crawled through and examined
the shore on each side.  He had found this creek, sailed
up it right past a bend, and found himself in sight of a
dozen or more junks all anchored together.  He had carried
on and opened fire on them, but found that they were too
much for him.  He had lost his mainmast, had two men
killed when it fell, had to haul out again, and, not being
able to avoid the rocks in the middle of the creek, had
run hard and fast on them.</p>
<p>Jim told me the story, and how they daren't try and
get her off again because she had such a big hole in her
bottom, and how the junks had tried to come and capture
her, but had to come singly, and couldn't face the
six-pounder shells and the Maxim, and had drawn back.
Last night they had tried to rush them in boats, but
Mr. Trevelyan had rigged nets all round, and it blew
very hard, and many boats were stove in on the rocks,
and the nets and the Maxim gun drove off those that
did not get alongside.</p>
<p>"It was a most awful night, Dick," he said, "but I
wouldn't have missed it for the world, now it's all over.
And what we should have done without that ammunition
you gave us, I don't know."</p>
<p>All that day the pirates had been firing rifles at them
from both sides of the creek, and only one man at each
gun was allowed on deck, and they had had to be changed,
because three of them had been wounded.  Everyone else
had kept down below in the hold, with the dirty water
up to their knees.</p>
<p>"We couldn't have stuck it for another day," Jim told
me, "and Mr. Trevelyan was going to attempt to land
the guns on one of the bigger rocks, which had some
trees on it, that very night, and try and cut them down
and make a breastwork of them, and hold out till you came."</p>
<p>Mr. Trevelyan had sent him across to that rock during
the night to see if it was all right, and he had waded and
swam across, and then in the dark slipped down on his way
back, and cut himself against the rocks.  His hands, and
face, and chest, and all over, in fact, were all scratched—great
long scratches—and he was so stiff, he could hardly
move.  He had to be bandaged pretty well all over, but
was as happy as anything.  "Mr. Trevelyan is a fine
chap," he kept on saying.  "He's always thinking of
some new dodge.  It was grand."</p>
<p>"What are you firing at?" I asked him.  "Can you see
the junks from the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>?"</p>
<p>"No, they're round the corner, but the cliffs are full of
the brutes with rifles."</p>
<p>Dr. Hibbert wouldn't let us see Dicky.  "He's asleep
again," he called out from the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> poop.  "Don't
you come aboard, bothering round.  He'll do all right."
He had a lot of work to do, because one of the "Ringdoves"
had been very badly smashed "up" by that shot which had
hit her, and four or five of Mr. Trevelyan's men had been
more or less badly wounded, and had come across with
Jim in the whaler.  Dr. Hibbert, and the Paymaster, and
the sick-berth attendant were busy in the ward room
patching them up.</p>
<p>They had got up steam in the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> little steam
cutter, and Mr. Rashleigh and Mr. Trevelyan steamed up
past the rock and out of sight round the corner.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> fired her Maxim and the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> her
Nordenfelts to keep down the rifle fire, and they got past the
entrance safely and out of sight, but came back very soon.</p>
<p>I could see that Mr. Rashleigh was puffing out his
cheeks with importance, and that Mr. Trevelyan was
looking very vexed about something, as they went aboard
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and I heard afterwards that Mr. Rashleigh
had wanted to steam back to Tinghai at once to report
that he had found the headquarters of the pirates.
Mr. Trevelyan, however, wanted to burn the pirate junks first,
and, if the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> wouldn't go in and try, had offered to
do the job with her boats.</p>
<p>Eventually Mr. Rashleigh gave way, but he wouldn't
take the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> in till his Sub-lieutenant had surveyed
the creek, and he sent him away in the whaler to take
soundings, although Mr. Trevelyan swore that there was
enough water.</p>
<p>The whaler was all right whilst she was in sight, but
directly she got round the corner she lost a man wounded,
and came hurrying back again.  There was another row
then; but Mr. Trevelyan had his own way, and a Nordenfelt
machine gun was put in the bows of the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> cutter
and another in the steamboat, and we saw that they were
going to follow the whaler and protect her.</p>
<p>Jim and I were supposed to be getting some sleep all
this time, but we couldn't—of course we couldn't; and
just then Mr. Trevelyan shouted to us that I had to go
away in charge of the cutter, and Jim in charge of the
steamboat, if we'd had enough sleep.  The boats dropped
down alongside the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, and we were aboard in a jiffy,
Jim grinning with delight.  We shouted that we'd had
all the sleep we wanted and were quite wide awake, and
shoved off after the whaler, Jim taking me in tow and
I taking the whaler astern of me.</p>
<p>The steamboat towed us past the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>, quite close to
her.  She was an absolute wreck, and all one side looked
as though it was smashed in by a big rock.  She fired a
shell or two to prevent the brutes firing rifles at us from
the shore, and the five men left aboard her cheered us.
We got past without being fired at, and then we were out
of sight of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and the steamboat cast us off,
and we had to pull in towards the starboard side of the
creek and search that with our Nordenfelt, if anyone
fired.  The steamboat did the same on the other side,
and the Sub in the whaler went on taking soundings
between us.</p>
<p>"Cutter!" the Sub had shouted, and I held up my hand
(he didn't know my name), "open fire directly you hear
rifle shots;" and I sang out, "Ay, ay, sir!" and you may
bet we were keen as mustard, and "stood by" with the
Nordenfelt's hopper full of one-inch cartridges, and the
lever all ready to jerk backwards and forwards.</p>
<p>You should have seen us watching the banks.  I had
borrowed the signalman's field glasses, because my
telescope had disappeared in the wreckage of the <emphasis>Sally's</emphasis> poop,
and watched every bit of rock or bush, and saw several
Chinamen creeping about.  They had rifles, but didn't fire
them.</p>
<p>"There's a shot, sir!" cried the coxswain, and I saw a
splash near the steamboat, and Jim began banging away
with his Nordenfelt, but stopped after he'd fired three
times, and we had never another shot fired at us.  I was
rather pleased.  To make up for it, we suddenly came in
sight of the whole fleet of pirate junks, and a whole crowd
of ordinary junks lying behind them.  They weren't more
than five hundred yards away, and, when they saw us,
began beating drums, and clashing brass things, and
yelling, and letting off crackers to frighten us.  One of the
nearest had her side turned towards us, and began letting
off her guns as well, and the din was simply hideous.</p>
<p>It was just like going up to a peaceful wasp's nest and
stirring it up with a stick.</p>
<p>We were both close to the whaler, and the little round
shot began to come rather too near.  I heard Jim shout,
"Couldn't we go for them, sir?" and my boat's crew bent
forward to be ready for a spurt; but the Sub, who was
standing up in the whaler, shook his head, and ordered
Jim to take us in tow again.  He looked as if he'd jolly
well like to have tried, but he had to obey orders.</p>
<p>"There's enough bally water for an ironclad," he
shouted, "all the way up, but we must go back, or it'll
be too late for the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> to do anything."</p>
<p>So back we went again, the men pulling their oars to
make it easier for the steamboat, and the round shot
bobbing about in the water astern of us, till we'd got out
of sight.</p>
<p>But Mr. Rashleigh wouldn't move for anything the Sub
or Mr. Trevelyan said to him.  It would be dark in half
an hour, and he wasn't going to risk anything in the dark,
and would wait for daylight.  I was ordered to take my
cutter alongside the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>, and transfer her guns and
stores to the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.  This took nearly two hours in
the dark, and Mr. Trevelyan came in charge.  He was
simply bubbling over with anger.  "She's got a searchlight,
and the old <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> could go up there without
winking.  I bet 'Old Lest' would have cleared out the
whole blooming crowd by now.  My aunt! fancy wasting
the whole jumping day!  Call himself Rashleigh!  My
blessed grandmother!" and he spat in the water to show
his contempt.</p>
<p>The last thing I took away was my white ensign, and
although it was nighttime, I hoisted it on board the Sally
again.  It had several bullet holes through it, and was
torn and looked jolly warworn.  I thought even then that
I'd keep it—if the signalman didn't collar it himself—for
my mother, or perhaps give it to Nan when I got home.</p>
<p>We had cast off from the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and had anchored
close to her.  My orders were to make the cutter "fast"
along-side, man it in the morning with all the <emphasis>Sally's</emphasis> crew
who were left, and follow the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> up the creek directly
it was light.</p>
<p>I was very excited, but managed to find some place to
lie down, and slept jolly well, which only shows how very
tired I must have been.</p>
<p>Sharpe woke me at six, half an hour before sunrise.
We all had some hot cocoa and some biscuit, and then
we got as many rifles and revolvers and cutlasses as we
could find, and filled the Gardner's hopper with cartridges.
We crept about in the dark without making any noise,
could presently hear the hands "turning out" aboard the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and took our places in the cutter and waited to
shove her off.  When it was light enough to just see the
rocks, Mr. Rashleigh called out that he was not going to
weigh for another half-hour, and there we had to sit, and
the longer we waited the less brave we felt—at any rate,
I felt.  I don't believe that anyone can feel brave on a dark
cold morning.</p>
<p>It seemed like hours before we heard her cable "clanking
in", and that woke us up again with a funny, cold
feeling, and in a few minutes the water under her stern
began to swirl, and she started very slowly for the
entrance, and we pulled away from the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> after her.</p>
<p>Then there came a surprise, if you like.  My aunt! it
did startle us.</p>
<p>Right on top of the cliffs, over our heads, a terrific roar
broke out, and splash went a shot right under the
<emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> stern, and the water fell right aboard her.</p>
<p>"They've hauled a gun up there—on the right, sir,"
Sharpe said very quietly, and somehow or other I felt
certain that this would decide Mr. Rashleigh not to go
up that creek.  I am certain that he never really wanted
to go there.</p>
<p>He yelled to me to come alongside, and then he yelled
for me to go back to the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, cut her cable, and clear
out of it.</p>
<p>I was very frightened, and hurried back to the
<emphasis>Sally</emphasis>—Ah Chee was the only one aboard her—when another roar
came from above, the shot fell between the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and
ourselves, and wetted us all.  I saw the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> hurrying
towards the foot of the cliffs, where the gun couldn't touch
her.</p>
<p>"We must be nippy, sir," Sharpe said, very excitedly
for him.</p>
<p>Just as we were going to run alongside, someone sang
out, "What on earth's that, sir?" pointing to a small rock
on the other side of the creek.  We all looked, and could
see someone standing there and waving his arms.  "He's
trying to semaphore," several men cried, and a moment
after, "It's Lootenant Travers, sir."</p>
<p>None of us thought of that gun then, and we shoved off
towards him as hard as we could—there were only six of us
in a ten-oared cutter—and gave a shout.</p>
<p>"Swim towards us, sir," I yelled, as we got closer and
bullets came round, though I didn't really notice them
much.  There was a Chinaman with him, and they both
waded out as far as they could, and we grabbed them and
hauled them in, and pulled back again with another shout,
Mr. Travers taking one of the spare oars, and the
Chinaman, who was almost dead of fright, hiding under the
gunwale.</p>
<p>As we hauled Travers on board he asked, "Have you
found Sally Hobbs?" but I shook my head, and hadn't
time to think what that all meant, and shouted to Sharpe,
"Cut the anchor rope directly we get aboard and hoist
the fores'l."  I needn't have troubled, because that gun
above us fired again, and we saw the stump of poor little
<emphasis>Sally's</emphasis> mainmast come toppling down, big pieces of her
deck went flying about, and she began to heel over as we
ran alongside.  Mr. Travers and I jumped aboard, but I
saw that she was done for.  Her deck was absolutely
smashed up amidships, the six-pounder had fallen on
top of the cartridge boxes in the hold, and water was
bubbling up through two great holes in her bottom.</p>
<p>"We shall have to leave her, sha'n't we, sir?" I asked.</p>
<p>But there was no doubt of it, and I only just had time
to haul down the white ensign and get back into the boat
and shove off, before she settled right down, and with a
bubbling noise slid under.</p>
<p>"'Twill drown all them cursed bugs and cockroaches
what's been biting at us, curse 'em!" Sharpe said coolly,
and we shoved off for the gunboat under the cliff.  You
bet that Ah Chee had jumped into the cutter directly
we'd got alongside!</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> was waiting for us, and we were all aboard
in five minutes.  She sneaked out round the foot of the
cliffs—Mr. Rashleigh didn't wait to take soundings now—ran
out of the channel past where the two guns had been,
without being fired at, and started off for Tinghai.</p>
<p>I saw Mr. Rashleigh rubbing his hands, and heard him
chuckling, "I've rescued Travers, and the 'Old Man' will
be jolly pleased."  He seemed to be awfully proud of
himself, but Mr. Trevelyan told Jim angrily: "Of course the
Skipper will be pleased; everyone knows that; but he
might have burnt the whole nest of them as well, wiped
out the whole boiling crowd, if he'd only had the pluck to
go in yesterday.  Instead of which he gives those chaps
time to haul their guns up over his head, where he can't
touch it.  Confound him!"</p>
<p>Mr. Travers came up on deck soon afterwards, shaved
and clean, with some of the Sub's plain clothes on.  He
shook my hand.  "Long time since you shoved me in the
back in that crowd outside the Mission House, Ford.
Thought they would have plugged some of you in that
boat.  They were firing pretty fast."  That was
tremendously demonstrative for him.</p>
<p>It was jolly good to have got him back safely, but we
were all awfully disappointed that we hadn't found where
Sally and her father were.  We had thought we had
done so, but he told us they weren't there, and he
hadn't the faintest idea where they were.  The Chinaman
who'd helped him to escape, and had come along
for his reward, didn't know anything about them either.
Ah Chee found this out.</p>
<p>Dicky was a jolly lot better, and could talk, but hadn't
the faintest remembrance of anything after we'd sighted
those four junks beating up to wind'ard after us.  He
remembered the junk running away from us and the masts
coming down, but nothing after that.</p>
<p>Dr. Hibbert wouldn't let him talk to us much.
Poor Cooke died before we had got out of sight of land,
and we stopped our engines and buried him at sea.</p>
<p>That brought the killed ones in the two junks up to
six—two of Jim's and four of mine—and there were six wounded
besides Dicky.</p>
<p>I managed to hide away the ensign before the signalman
could claim it, and felt rather a beast; but I meant to
keep it and get it home—some day.  Jim lent me another
monkey jacket.  It was quite "sopping" wet, but it was
clean, and we soon dried it, so that I looked more
respectable, and didn't feel so horrid as I had felt in my
bloodstained one.</p>

<p><strong>The Vigilant Sails Again</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Padré Complains—Mr. Hoffman Returns—Under Way
Again—Good News—"Good Old Dicky!"—Mr. Rashleigh's
Report—A Unfair Report</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Commander Truscott</emphasis></p>
<p>I had had an extremely busy ten days superintending the
fitting out of those junks, and getting them and the
gunboats away to their cruising grounds.  I think that I had
offended pretty nearly everyone in the ship, from the Fleet
Surgeon, who disliked parting with so many sick bay
stores, to the youngest cadet, who thought that he ought
to have been given a chance.</p>
<p>The Skipper was positively in a vile temper all the time,
and I, myself, and old Bax, the Fleet Paymaster, who came
from the same part of the country as he did, were the only
ones who dared to approach him.  He simply spat fire
whenever anyone spoke to him, and the simplest thing
used to bring forth a torrent of oaths, and it was best to
beat a hasty retreat.</p>
<p>Don't think that I minded, or anyone else—really.
"How's 'Old Lest' this morning?" they would ask, after
I had reported morning "divisions" to him, and I must
say that I generally had to say "Worse than ever".
They would all chuckle at that.</p>
<p>For some reason or other everyone, except the Skipper
himself, seemed to be proud of his temper, and the more
he roared and swore, the more the men liked him.</p>
<p>"He's the worst-tempered man in the service, I should
imagine," the young Padré had remarked one morning,
when he and I and Mayhew, the Fleet Surgeon, were
walking up and down the quarterdeck, and could hear him
storming at "Willum" down below.</p>
<p>"For worst-tempered read best-tempered," Mayhew had
replied fierily.  "You've only been a 'dog watch' in the
service, and when you know something about it, you'll
know that you are wrong.  Why, man, he's the best
Skipper to serve under in the whole blessed navy.  Call
him bad tempered!  Why, great snakes! that's the temper
coming out of him instead of being bottled up.  It's only
fools and rotters who have tempers that don't come out."</p>
<p>I fancy that the Padré's knowledge of human nature was
of the slightest, and I also must admit that it was probably
very difficult to preach a good sermon to the accompaniment
of the Skipper's snores, but he hadn't quite shaken
down in his new surroundings.</p>
<p>When he first joined the ship his sermons were full of
"my dear brothers", or "dear brethren", and it was
as good as a play to see the Skipper's face when he
happened to be awake and first heard himself called a
"dear brother".  I thought he would have had a "fit",
and after church he stalked down below without saying
a word, Blucher at his heels, and sent for me.</p>
<p>Then out it came.  He had bottled it up for nearly
twenty minutes, and he pretty well excelled himself.
"That little—little—whipper—snapper call 'Old Lest'
his 'dear brother'!  Don't let him come near 'Old
Lest'.  I'll 'dear brother' him if he does it again!" and
he glared at me and shook his huge fists in my
face absolutely unable to say anything more.</p>
<p>"Very good, sir; I will speak to the Chaplain," I
had answered, and fled.</p>
<p>For some reason or other I forgot to do so, but, after
lunch that morning, the younger people in the mess spread
him out on the sofa, very gently, and sat on him.  I
happened to go into the ward room at the moment, and
found eight of them and Old Bax in a heap, with bits
of the young idiot showing out here and there under
them, and heard them sing out, "Here's another dear
brother," as they bumped him and he gasped for breath,
and implored them to leave off.  I slipped back to my
cabin, and, as I expected, there was a knock at my door a
few minutes afterwards, and in he came, very dishevelled,
and complained of the indignity.</p>
<p>"You surprise me, Padré," I told him.  "I can only
say that I happened to go to the mess, and saw you
'scrapping' with your brother officers in the most
unbecoming manner, and endeavouring, as far as I could
make out, to break up the mess furniture.  I trust that
such conduct will not occur again."</p>
<p>He got very red and confused, and was going away,
when I called him back: "Of course, Padré, you must
remember that if they do dislike any of your expressions,
you often enough complain of some of theirs, and I should
advise you to humour them.  It's often a great effort on
their part to humour you, and you should be proud that
they do try.  I will speak to them, but strongly advise
you to drop the 'dear brother' part of the show."</p>
<p>I'm glad to say that he did, and eventually became quite
proud of relating the bumping incident as "a stepping-stone
in my education for a life so strange, and at one
period so apparently uncongenial, ah!"</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he was always called "dear
brother" after that, so never had the chance to forget it.
To come back to my yarn, the absence of three
watch-keepers and so many petty officers and men, to say
nothing of the midshipmen, made it difficult enough to
carry on the ordinary work of the ship.  This was a
constant source of irritation to Lawrence, Whitmore,
and myself, and above all, there was the added
overwhelming anxiety at the fate of Travers, Sally, and
her father.  It was now five weeks since they had
disappeared, and I assure you that these weeks had only
increased our anxiety and the feeling of utter helplessness
at our inability to discover their whereabouts and
rescue them.  Somewhere, but whether north, south,
east, or west, we had not the faintest notion, they were
waiting for a sign of our coming, and every evening,
as the sun set and the dark clouds and grey twilight
shut out the islands all round us and wrapped them in
darkness, the feeling of depression used to become still
more acute, and we used to imagine them beginning
another dreary night of waiting, and longing, and praying
that the morning would bring them rescue, which we all
knew it wouldn't.  These things, and the want of exercise
on shore, were excuses sufficient to account for any
irritability of temper.</p>
<p>The Skipper used to tramp the quarterdeck from after
"evening quarters" till sunset, but then the sight of the
long skeins of ducks, geese, and swans flighting across
the harbour to the mud flats round some of the smaller
islands used to drive him down below.  He used to
growl: "Umph!  That's what 'Old Lest' came down
here to do, to shoot 'em, and he's only made a fool of
himself so far.  Umph!" and he'd send "Willum"
round for three of us to go aft to make up a rubber of
whist.</p>
<p>But at last the long period of inaction came to an end.
One morning, just a week after the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and her two
junks had left, I had turned out with the hands, and was
walking up and down till my servant had made my morning
cup of tea, the quarterdeck men scrubbing and holystoning
round me in the dismal light.</p>
<p>I noticed a little native sailing boat beating up to
Tinghai, and I remember that I thought it strange for so small
a boat to have been out at night time.  As it came towards
the harbour, I watched it idly through my telescope, and
presently saw that there were three men in it—a Chinaman
steering and two people pulling lee oars, one a Chinaman
and—I looked again to make sure—the other a tall gaunt
fellow with a shaggy black beard.  "That's a rum go," I
thought, and was still more surprised when I saw them
lower the sail—they were directly to leeward of us—and
begin to pull straight towards the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"What on earth's going to happen now?" I thought,
as the boat crept alongside, the men pulling very feebly.
The gaunt European half crawled up the ladder and
advanced towards me, and for a moment I did not recognize
him.</p>
<p>"Hoffman!" he said.</p>
<p>Good heavens!  I recognized him then, even with that
black beard, and with his face sunken and starved looking.
"We thought you'd been burnt," I said, holding out my
hand, as he tottered on to the quarterdeck.</p>
<p>"Give me some drink and food, and those men too," he
gasped; and I led him down below to my cabin—I thought
he would have fallen down the hatchway, he was so weak.
Fortunately my servant had just brought my tea and some
bread and butter, and he drank and ate as if he had not
touched food for a week.</p>
<p>I sent for another plate of bread and butter, and when
he had finished that, and drunk all my tea and two tumblers
full of water, he didn't wait for me to ask him any
questions, but, clutching at the chair, and with a wild look
in his eyes, began, "For God's sake, Commander, get the
Captain to start at once!  I know where Hobbs and his
daughter are, or were, six days ago, and if you are quick
you may rescue them before they can be hurried off
somewhere else."</p>
<p>"Good heavens, man! and Travers, do you know where
he is too?" I shouted, jumping up.</p>
<p>"Yes, I do; but he's not with them," he answered.</p>
<p>"Is she safe?" I asked eagerly; and he nodded, "Yes;
up to the present."</p>
<p>"How the dickens did you escape being burnt?  We've
actually read the funeral service over the ruins of the
Mission."</p>
<p>"Wait," he half moaned.  "Go and tell your Captain
I am here, and give me a cigarette—I haven't tasted one
for a month."</p>
<p>I woke the Skipper.  "That German, Hoffman, has
come aboard, sir.  Says he knows where Sally is and
Travers."</p>
<p>"What?" roared the Skipper, opening his eyes.</p>
<p>"That German chap Hoffman has come aboard, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, don't wake me," he grunted, not hearing me
properly.</p>
<p>"He's that man we thought had been burnt in the
Mission House.  He knows where Hobbs and Sally and
Travers are," I repeated in a louder voice; and he jumped
out of his bunk, swearing angrily, "Why didn't you tell
me before?" and roared for "Willum" to help him dress.
"Bring him aft in five minutes' time," he growled.</p>
<p>"For goodness sake, don't suggest anything to him!
Don't attempt to give him any advice," I implored
Hoffman.  "Ten to one, if you do, he'll put obstacles in
the way.  Just tell him what you know, and nothing more."</p>
<p>"I'll remember," he said wearily, as I took him aft.
He had to steady himself with one hand on my shoulder,
he was so weak; his clothes simply hung in loose folds.</p>
<p>I slipped away and turned out Hutton, our Engineer
Commander, telling him what I knew, and that the Skipper
would be sending for him in a minute or two.  In fact, he
hardly pulled his trousers over his pyjamas before he
was sent for.  "How long will it take to get up steam?"
I asked him, as I helped him on with his monkey jacket.
"An hour; we're still under banked fires—have been all
the time," and then I went round, turning everyone out.
It was such a godsend to have at last some news to tell.</p>
<p>"D'they know where Mr. Travers and the pretty little
lady be, sir?" the captain of the quarterdeck asked me;
and I heard him tell his men, and they left off scrubbing
to discuss the situation.  "Little lady or no little lady,"
he sang out, "just you go on with your 'olystoning."</p>
<p>In less than half an hour we had steam on the capstan,
and were shortening in the cable, and in another hour were
under way.  It was glorious to feel the engines moving
round again and the beastly steam steering gear rattling
under my cabin once more, and to know that at last our
long six weeks of inaction were at an end.</p>
<p>There wasn't a long face or a sour face in the ship that
day.</p>
<p>The Skipper had filled his pockets with his beloved
Havanas, and pulled one out for me on the fore bridge
too—a sure sign that he was in the best of tempers.</p>
<p>"That chap Hoffman couldn't lift a hundredweight
now," he chuckled.  "I'll take him 'on' when he's had
a bit of sleep—the only chance I'll get," and he gurgled
and croaked with laughter.  "He don't exactly give
himself away, does he, Truscott?  Couldn't get him to
suggest a single thing."</p>
<p>"I told him not to, sir," I said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Umph!  Think 'Old Lest' an obstinate old fool, do
you?  Think you know 'Old Lest' better'n he knows
himself, do you?  That's the worst of having a commander
who's been shipmates for seven years.  Umph!"  And he
glared at me, and was in a grand humour.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, there were several reasons which
made it inconvenient to leave so hurriedly.  For one
thing, we were, as you know, very shorthanded, and
for another, we expected the gunboats to return at any
moment with their tenders, and it would, at the best,
be a tedious business to call them all in.  Fortunately
we met the old <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> pounding back to Tinghai
for more coal; judging by the smoke she made she seemed
to grind it into dust and then blow it up her funnel.  We
stopped her, and the Skipper sent on board to tell her
Captain where the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> was going, and to ask him
to communicate with the other gunboats, and with the
<emphasis>Omaha</emphasis>, which had gone off by herself.</p>
<p>Ching evidently wrote the letter which came back,
promising to do this, and he sent a private one to his chum
Lawrence to say that they were all immensely pleased to
hear that there was a chance of rescuing the captives, and
that the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> would come along after us as soon as
possible.</p>
<p>"He says that his shoulder is practically all right again
now, sir.  He's made a jolly sight less fuss about it than I
should have done."  Lawrence smiled when he'd finished
reading this letter.  "I wonder how much he cares whether
we ever see Hobbs or Travers again?  He doesn't hurry
the old <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> round these islands to find them, I bet
you anything you like, sir.  He's hunting for Sally.  He's
simply head over heels in love with her."</p>
<p>"More power to his elbow," I said.  "We all are,
more or less."</p>
<p>We had left orders for the gunboats to follow us—left
them with Macpherson the missionary, so felt sure that
they would fetch up, sooner or later, even if the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>
missed them.</p>
<p>The island for which we were now steering was right
away in the SE. corner of the archipelago, one of a group
marked on the chart as the Hector Group (it was so named
after a transport which was wrecked there in 1851).</p>
<p>It was there that Hobbs and his daughter were reported
to be by Hoffman, and it took the Skipper but a very few
minutes to determine that he would go there first and leave
Travers till later.</p>
<p>As it happened, by great good fortune, there was no
necessity to regret his decision, because just after dark
we sighted the lights of a steamer, flashed the "demand"
from our masthead lamp, and it turned out to be the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> on the way back to Tinghai.  I wasn't on the bridge
at the time, and had only just reached the deck after she
was reported to me, when I heard men cheering, and a
midshipman rushed up, "Mr. Travers is on board, sir,
and well, sir!  Isn't that grand?"</p>
<p>It's extraordinary how good—and bad—news comes in
lumps together, and this seemed suddenly to make me feel
ten years younger.  I was up that bridge in a "brace of
shakes".  We had stopped our engines, and the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>
was flashing across a long signal, and everyone bent eagerly
forward to try and take it in, whilst the signalman wrote
it down, and clicked the shutter of his hand lamp to show
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> that he had taken it in correctly.</p>
<p>Most of us were so much out of practice that we only
got a word or a number here or there, but enough to know
that she and her junks had lost a lot of men.  At last
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> had finished, and the signalman brought his
signal pad to the Captain.</p>
<p>"Read it out, Truscott; your eyes are younger than mine."</p>
<p>Someone held up a lantern, and I read: "Have rescued
Lieutenant Travers uninjured from island of Chung-li Tao
Group.  No news of whereabouts of Hobbs or daughter.
Tender <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> sunk by gun fire; tender <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> wrecked
and abandoned, guns saved.  Losses—<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, one man
wounded, since dead, two wounded; <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, four[#] men
killed, Mid Morton, two men wounded; <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>, two men
killed, five wounded."</p>
<p>[#] Cooke, A.B., had died as a result of his injuries.</p>
<p>"Phew!" whistled the Skipper.  "They've had a hot
time!  Read it again."</p>
<p>I did so.</p>
<p>"Do they mean young Morton's killed or wounded?"</p>
<p>"Ask them."</p>
<p>Click, click went the shutter of the signalman's lamp.</p>
<p>You could not hear a sound whilst the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> light
twinkled the reply, and we all gave a gasp of relief when
we read—W-O-U-N-D—O-F—S-C-A-L-P—O-U-T—O-F—D-A-N-G-E-R.</p>
<p>"Get 'em all aboard," the Skipper told me; "best send
both cutters," and he sent a midshipman running aft.
"Tell the Doctor—ten wounded coming from <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>."</p>
<p>We signalled across for her to "close", and that we
were sending for the wounded and for the rest of the crews
of the two junks.</p>
<p>This was a jolly ticklish job, because a rather heavy sea
was running; but we ran our searchlights, and I sent
Lawrence and Whitmore away in charge of the boats, and we
managed to transfer them all without anything happening
worse than breaking one or two oars.</p>
<p>We gave Travers a cheer when he came across, and all
crowded round and congratulated him; and we cheered
Trevelyan, young Rawlings and their men, and Ford
and his.  They had come over in the first boat, and
Rashleigh had come as well—to report personally.</p>
<p>Whilst he was down below I got a list of the names
of those killed and wounded from Trevelyan, and had
it stuck on the lower deck notice board.  Scroggs was
a serious loss to me—the captain of the fore top, and
a fine reliable man—and the others were all good men;
they wouldn't have been sent there, of course, if they
hadn't been.</p>
<p>Ford and his six men had lost everything except what
they stood up in, but every one of them was in the best
of spirits.  The second cutter came along-side with the
wounded, and young Morton was the first to be carried
up the ladder, managed a smile from under his bandages,
and we gave him a cheer.</p>
<p>The mids who'd been left behind sang out, "Good old
Dicky".  I knew perfectly well that he had been called
"Dear Little Dicky", and that the inoffensive, harmless
little chap hated it, and was glad to hear them drop it for
once.  I knew a good many more of the "ins and outs"
of what went on in the gunroom than the Mids used to
give me credit for.</p>
<p>The rest of the wounded were carried up, or hobbled up
the ladder, and they all went for'ard to the sick bay.</p>
<p>Then Rashleigh went back, simply bubbling over with
importance and excitement, the Skipper actually coming
up to see him over the side.  He didn't often pay anyone
under the rank of post captain that compliment.</p>
<p>"I thought that chap a blooming blockhead—told you
so often—but he's done a jolly sight better than I gave
him credit for; that he has, Truscott, that he has.  And
he's found a place where they're as thick as thieves—big
guns mounted, and all that.  I've sent him back to
keep his eye on it.  Jolly smart chap!  Things are just
coming along now, eh?  They'll find 'Old Lest' ain't
such a fool as they think, eh?"</p>
<p>"We've made a good start, sir, although we've lost
rather heavily."</p>
<p>"Put up a subscription list, Truscott; some of those
men have left families.  Stick me down for twenty-five
'thick 'uns'.  It's more than 'Old Lest' can afford, but
stick 'em down.  If the Admiralty don't pay for those
junks, and the others get knocked about or lost as well,
'Old Lest' 'll find himself in the Bankruptcy Court, umph!"</p>
<p>"Make a signal: Captain Lester to Captain, officers,
and men of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"The Captain, officers, and men of the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> congratulate
you on the plucky rescue of Lieutenant Travers
and the two junks' crews."</p>
<p>He sent for'ard to tell the Fleet Surgeon to let him know
directly he could come down to see the wounded, and then
stalked along the upper deck to the bridge, swinging his
great shoulders and striding down an admiring lane of
men, who made a gangway and stood to attention as
he passed.  You could see, even by the little light there
was, how they worshipped him.</p>
<p>We hoisted in our boats and steamed off towards our
island, the little <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> turning back to hers and
signalling, "Captain, officers, and men," to ditto.  "Thank you
very much.  We are very proud to have the honour of
serving under your orders."</p>
<p>That pleased the Skipper—the last part, I mean—for
he was simply a huge simple-minded baby, and he grunted,
and puffed at his cigar.</p>
<p>"He's tickled to death with that," Lawrence whispered
to me.  "Old Rashleigh knows how to get the soft side of
him, doesn't he?"</p>
<p>Rashleigh had brought over a written report of his
proceedings, a copy of which I give you, so that you
may draw your own conclusions.  He had not had time
to finish it properly, and I hardly think that he could have
read it over either, after having written it.</p>
<p>


H.M.S. <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>,

Off the Chung-li Tao Group, Chusan Archipelago,</p>
<p><emphasis>May</emphasis> 7th.</p>
<p>SIR,—In pursuance of your orders, I have the honour to
report that I towed the two tenders, the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>,
Lieutenant Trevelyan, and the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, Midshipman Ford, to
a position five miles to wind'ard (the wind being SSW.)
of the Chung-li Tao Islands, arriving there at 8 a.m. on
the 2nd May.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. I despatched the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> to search to the
east'ard, and the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> to the west'ard, and repaired
to a rendezvous to leeward of them, giving them
instructions which should meet any probable eventualities
which might arise.</p>
<p>I waited at the rendezvous till the morning of the 4th
May, and then sighted the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, and ordered her to come
alongside.  She reported that she had three men killed,
Mid Morton and two A.B.'s severely wounded, and that
she was much damaged by shot above the water line.  She
had chased a pirate junk and sunk her, but had then most
unwisely attacked four others, and only escaped with the
above losses.  Her Maxim gun had been destroyed, and
she had expended practically all her six-pounder ammunition.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford also reported having met the tender <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>
the night before, and that Mr. Trevelyan, contrary to my
orders, had at once altered course to the island where
the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> had been attacked.  The wind had veered to
NW. by N. during the night, and was now blowing a
strong breeze.  As it was therefore impossible for him
to beat back to me under three days, I took the wounded
on board my ship, buried two of his men at sea, and
steamed towards the island and channel in which
Mr. Ford had engaged the four junks.  The <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> followed
me at all speed.</p>
<p>I arrived off the entrance to the channel at noon of next
day, and on entering it was fired at by a two-gun battery
at close range.  One shot came aboard me and wounded
two men—one, Edward Larking, ord. sea. No. 867037,
has since died.  I silenced these guns, and proceeding
up the channel, discovered that Mr. Trevelyan had
wrecked his junk at the entrance to a small creek, and
was in a desperate position, being attacked by rifle fire
from both sides of the creek.</p>
<p>I made a hasty exploration of the creek, and found that
a quarter of a mile inland it opened out, and that anchored
there were a number of war junks, and a very large
number of merchant junks.</p>
<p>I determined to attack, but first deemed it necessary
to survey the channel, which operation was successfully
performed, under a heavy fire, by Sub-lieutenant Harrow,
who worked with great coolness, and lost one man wounded.</p>
<p>By the time the channel was reported as being sufficiently
deep to allow the passage of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, it
was dusk, and I determined to take her in at daybreak
of the following day.  Meanwhile I transferred
the guns and most of the stores of the <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis> to my
ship.</p>
<p>At daybreak I weighed, and was at once fired upon by
a gun, mounted on the cliffs three hundred feet above my
head, to which it was impossible to reply.</p>
<p>I immediately recognized that it would, under the
circumstances, be impossible to force the entrance, and stood
off, ordering the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> to follow me.</p>
<p>She was, however, struck by a large shot or shell,
and commenced to sink, and I had only sufficient time
to bring off her crew, and could not save any of her
stores.</p>
<p>The cutter which brought off her crew sighted a man
on the rocks, who semaphored that he was Lieutenant
Travers, and most pluckily brought him off under a heavy
fire.</p>
<p>I then altered course for Tinghai with the crews of
my tenders on board.</p>
<p>My officers and crew behaved with gallantry and
coolness under trying circumstances.</p>
<p>


I am, Sir,

Your obedient Servant,</p>

To

Captain CHARLES E. LESTER, R.N.,

H.M.S. <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,</p>
<p>Senior Officer, Chusan Archipelago.</p>
<p>It was no doubt written hurriedly and finished off abruptly
after sighting the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>; but from what I learned
afterwards, hardly gave a correct, or rather fair account
of the doings of his tenders.</p>
<p>I was rather amused by young Ford coming to my cabin
next morning.  He had a boat's ensign under his arm,
looked very sheepish, and wanted to know if he might
keep it.  "The signalman of the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> borrowed it, sir,
and hoisted it, without my knowing, whilst we were fighting
those junks—he didn't know that it was against orders—and
I do want to take it home 'so badly'."</p>
<p>I told him to run and hide it, and he could not have been
more pleased.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER IX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mr. Hoffman's Secret</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Bored Travers—Bored Travers Continues—"Old Lest" in
Form—"We've Got 'em at Last"—A Dirty Night—"Old Lest"
Unfolds a Tale—Mr. Hoffman's Tale—"Old Lest" and
Hoffman—A Marvellous Old Chap</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Commander Truscott</emphasis></p>
<p>At the time of parting company with the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> the
weather was extremely unpleasant—heavy rain squalls and
a bitterly cold northerly wind—but it was snug enough
down below, and, to celebrate the return of Travers,
we gave him a great dinner in the ward room.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to tell you that we were all in the
very brightest spirits, and spent a most jovial and riotous
evening—all except, funnily enough, Travers himself.  He
was always a bit bored at these shows, and "turned in"
early, only too glad to find himself once more in his own
bunk.  He was known throughout the fleet as Bored-Travers,
or "B.-T.", his full surname being Gore-Travers,
and was rather a weird chap, with a superior, supercilious,
"Bond-Street-on-a-swagger-morning air" about him, which,
somehow or other, gave everyone the idea that he looked
"down" upon everybody else.  You couldn't help liking him,
however, for all that.  I had never seen him enthusiastic
about anything except a pretty girl or a game of cricket,
and now after dinner he looked bored to distraction, leant
wearily against a stanchion, and told Lawrence and the
others his yarn.  It was like drawing teeth out of a horse,
to get him to tell anything at all.</p>
<p>"Oh! that night, um!  Oh yes!  I remember.  One of
those Mission native chaps got hold of me when I'd got
inside the gates—couldn't shake him off—too much bore
altogether, you fellows.  He was so jolly earnest, I just went
along with him.  He said something about Old Hobbs and
his daughter being carried away, or something.  I had to
go, you know—had never seen the girl—all you fellows
said she was pretty—forgot 'A' company wasn't coming
along too."</p>
<p>He stopped in the most irritating way to fill his pipe.
"Same beastly old tobacco in the mess—can't get it to
draw—never could."</p>
<p>"Didn't you find them, and have a scrap down there on
the beach?" Trevelyan asked.  "There was a Chinaman
down there—dead, with a Webley revolver bullet in him."</p>
<p>"Did I kill him?" he asked, without the faintest display
of interest.  "I knew the beastly revolver would go off
some day and hurt someone.  Someone took it away after
that—lots of them—shoved a beastly cloth over my head,
and shoved me into a boat.  They seemed to want me to
stay still, so I did."</p>
<p>"Did they knock you about much?"  "Didn't you see
Sally?" several asked, and Trevelyan very eagerly added,
"How many boats did you see?  We thought there were
three.  We saw the keel marks of three in the mud."</p>
<p>He seemed quite amused at their eagerness.</p>
<p>"Well, you chaps, I think they must have knocked
me on the head.  I didn't remember much about it—didn't
see anything I could swear to—rather fancy, though, there
were two boats, and, now you mention it, that I did hear a
girl's scream just before.  Don't remember anything else
till I woke up, with a beastly headache, and a mouth like
a limekiln, in a jolly sight better cabin than I've got on
board here."</p>
<p>"That must have been Hobbs's yacht!  What happened then?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all—couldn't shave—had forgotten to
bring my razors and" (yawning) "my dressing case with
me—there wasn't a towel there, or water even—and there
they kept me till they shoved me ashore, where young Ford
found me."</p>
<p>"Ford?" I said, chipping in.  "I thought Rashleigh
did that."  The Skipper had just shown me his report.</p>
<p>"Rashleigh!  No, sir.  He was shoving out of it as hard
as he could go.  Young Ford came along and picked me
off—he and the rest of his junk's crew—in the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis>
cutter.  The Chinamen wasted a lot of good ammunition
over the lot of us, and I'd have made 'em pay for it if I'd
been in" (yawning) "charge of 'em.</p>
<p>"Plucky chap that," he went on placidly, ordering the
marine servant to bring him more sugar for his coffee.
"I told him so.  Hope it won't make him more conceited
than he is.</p>
<p>"How about that Chinese cove who came along with me
in the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>!" he asked, with some little display of
interest.</p>
<p>"He's all right, B.-T.," someone said.  "Came aboard
with the wounded."</p>
<p>"Um!  I thought I'd given him the slip.  Promised him
a hundred dollars for getting me out of it, and" (yawning
several times) "I haven't got a hundred cents in the
world."</p>
<p>"That's all right.  You've got your last month's pay
due to you," Old Bax growled impatiently.  "But, man
alive, shove on with your yarn."</p>
<p>Travers simply opened his eyes a little more widely,
looked amusedly at him, and yawned again.</p>
<p>"What did you do all the time?"  "Give you decent
grub?"  "Did you see the boss of the show?"  Questions
simply poured in, but he languidly helped himself to more
sugar, and stirred his coffee.</p>
<p>"Why the dickens can't our cook make better stuff
than this?  The grub was beastly, and I grew a beastly
beard, and everything was" (yawning) "beastly.  There
was a chap there—an old Scotch engineer fellow—seemed
to belong to the show—came across to yarn once or
twice—said he was tired of having no one to talk to—but he
bored me, so didn't come often."</p>
<p>"Weren't you excited when you heard the firing?" the
young Padré asked.</p>
<p>"Interested," Travers drawled; "I'm never excited—just
interested," and he put on his most superior look,
and the young Padré retired in confusion.  "There was
a bit of a shindy—guns, and all that—about a week after
I'd been there.  It was rather interesting—at any rate the
coves there thought so."</p>
<p>I remembered now that Rashleigh had reported having
heard the sound of guns in the direction of the Chung-li Tao
Group about that time, and had had his head snapped off
by the Skipper for his pains.  He may have been right, after
all.  "What happened?  Who were firing?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I don't know, sir; think they must have had a bit of a
'pick up' among themselves.  I did mention it to the old
Scotchman, but he wasn't giving anything away just then,
and I never thought of asking him again."</p>
<p>"Was he a prisoner too?" I asked.  He was very irritating.</p>
<p>"Oh no!  Think he bossed the show—when he was
sober.  Told me one day that they'd sent the Old Yank
and Sally somewhere, where we'd never find them.  Seemed
to know a good deal about it, and seemed sorry for the girl
too."</p>
<p>"I'm going to turn in now, you fellows, if you don't
mind.  Thank you very much, but I haven't slept in a bed
for six" (yawning) "weeks," and he stretched himself and
yawned again and went away.</p>
<p>Trevelyan disappeared with him and came back
triumphantly.  He had that glove which we had picked up
behind the Mission House.  "We were right, after all,
sir!  That was his glove, and he had borrowed
Lawrence's handkerchief.  I've got that much out of him.
He says he'll never stuff a handkerchief up his sleeve
again.  He'd given a couple of pounds" (if there had
been anyone to borrow from) "not to have dropped it."</p>
<p>"It's the first thing I've ever got back after he once
borrowed it," Lawrence sang out, and we all laughed with
him.</p>
<p>The Skipper came in presently (Hoffman had been dining
with him, but had turned in directly afterwards), and we
dragged Old Bax, the Fleet Paymaster, to the piano and
made him sing, "Tam Pearce, Tam Pearce, bring me my
grey mare"; and the Skipper joined in the chorus and
smoked, and Old Bax "cadged" his best cigars from
him and smoked them, one after another.  The Skipper
grunted and growled, and was redder in the face than ever,
took off his mess jacket and loosened his braces, and beat
everyone else at feats of strength, and was as happy as a
sand-boy.  He went down into the gunroom to say a few
words, as he put it, and I went with him.  He squeezed
himself in, and, as they all stood up, growled out, "Umph!
Sit down, please!  'Old Lest' will give you all a
show—later on.  If those two steamers are there when we get in
to-morrow afternoon, umph! we'll go in and sink 'em.  If
there ain't enough water for the boats, we'll swim" (huge
yells of delight).  "Good night, gentlemen; three of you
have done a bit of fighting, the Fleet Surgeon hopes to get
Morton off the sick list in a day or two, and I hope you
others will do as well.  Umph!  You can have half an
hour's extra lights."</p>
<p>They made a perfect deafening noise, gave three cheers
and a "tiger", and then he came back to the ward room,
and stayed there till after midnight—the youngest of the
lot of us—he and Old Bax chaffing each other in broad
West Country dialect.  Old Bax had "wiped his eye",
the last time they had gone shooting, by bagging a
woodcock which the Skipper had missed with both barrels, and
never lost an opportunity of reminding him of it.</p>
<p>Whitmore and I slipped away long before the ward room
singsong was finished, and the ship quiet again, because
we had to make all arrangements for manning and arming
boats if necessary.  You see, we had so many seaman
ratings away, that it was rather difficult to fill their
places.</p>
<p>Hoffman had his breakfast in his cabin, and spent two
hours alone with the Skipper during the morning, and I
did not see him again till we were nearing the Hector
Group late in the afternoon.  He then came up and helped
Lawrence pick his way among the islands towards the
one where he said that Hobbs and Sally were imprisoned.</p>
<p>We all hoped to discover the tramp steamer and the
yacht anchored there, but very much feared that the
prisoners might have been spirited away again in one or
other of them.  The anxiety grew greater as we drew
nearer, and was shared by every soul on board, for
everyone knew by this time all that I myself knew.</p>
<p>It struck me as peculiar how intimate and accurate was
Hoffman's knowledge of the local pilotage.  There seemed
to be some strange "bond" between him and the Skipper,
and I felt sure, from the Skipper's manner to him, and from
his silence to me, that there was something which I did
not know, and which would explain a good many things
when I did know it.</p>
<p>One thing indeed the Captain had told me, blurting it out
when I reported "defaulters" to him, and found him and
Hoffman together.  "Hoffman tells me that that rascally
Englishman, who sold that yacht of his to Hobbs, is
bossing this show.  He's hanging on to Hobbs and Sally, and
trying to force the poor little lass to marry him—umph! or
make her father pay a pretty penny.  He'll skin him out
pretty thoroughly, I'll be bound."</p>
<p>"If you don't get hold of her quickly, Captain, I believe
she'll consent," Hoffman said.</p>
<p>"Just to save old man Hobbs's dollars, eh?  Poor little
lass, eh?" the Skipper grunted.</p>
<p>"Partly that and partly because he is such a handsome,
dare-devil scoundrel, that I don't think she'd be unwilling;"
and Hoffman moaned and buried his face in his hands.  He
was still as weak as a rat, and couldn't control his feelings.</p>
<p>"Poor little soul!" the Skipper said softly.  "God help
us to get her out of his clutches!"</p>
<p>At about five bells (2.30 p.m.) in the afternoon we eventually
sighted the island, a low irregular line on the horizon
right ahead, a gloomy enough prison under its dark sullen
banks of rain clouds.  The wind had gone down during
the morning watch, and the sea was fairly smooth, but the
rain still came down mercilessly, and everything was
dripping with moisture and extremely uncomfortable.
"Masthead lookout!" roared the Skipper from the fore bridge,
"keep your eye lifting for two steamers lying under the
land," and to assist him sent up the sharpest eyed signalman.</p>
<p>In spite of the drenching downpour, the fo'c'stle and
under the fore bridge was crowded with men, all their
eyes glued on the land as we very slowly forged towards
it through the muddy yellow water.  I don't suppose that
there was a single field glass or telescope in the ship not
in use.</p>
<p>Then there came a yell from the masthead which made
us all look up.  "Yes, sir, I can see them—two steamers
under the land, right ahead, sir;" and we all stared ahead,
and in a few minutes could see them ourselves, and, quite
without orders, everyone cheered and waved his cap,
looking up at the Skipper from the fo'c'stle to see whether
he was looking happy.  The cheers were as much for
sighting the steamers as for knowing that now "Old
Lest" would have a chance of paying off old scores, and
the Skipper, looking bigger than ever in his dripping
tarpaulins, roared out to ask me if I'd ever been aboard a
man-of-war before, and knew what discipline was; so I
sent my midshipman down to stop the noise.</p>
<p>"Umph!  Truscott, we've got 'em at last;" and he
slowly dug his fingers into the palms of his hands, as if he
was crushing something, glared at me, and shook them in
my face.</p>
<p>We slowly steamed along, till we took soundings under
six fathoms, and then anchored.  "Can't go in any
farther," I heard Hoffman tell Lawrence, and again
wondered how he had picked up all this knowledge.</p>
<p>The cable had scarcely finished rattling out before the
Skipper, turning to me, said, "Man and arm boats,
Commander; I'll go in directly.  Old Lest ain't going to let
grass grow under his feet."</p>
<p>"We've only got about two hours more daylight, sir," I
told him, thinking that there was scarcely time for the
boats to get ashore.</p>
<p>"Umph!" he growled, and went down below.</p>
<p>In forty minutes I'd got them all away, the steam
pinnace, with the Skipper and Hoffman aboard, towing the
launch and sailing pinnace, and the steam cutter towing
the barge and the two cutters.  We were so short of men
that Marshall and his marines had to man the sailing
pinnace, and very few men were left aboard to give them a
cheer as they shoved off, only about half a dozen seamen,
a few marines, and the stokers.</p>
<p>I had thought of keeping Trevelyan on board, but the
Skipper growled out, "Send him in with me.  'Old
Lest's' brain's not as sharp as it was.  He'll smell out
something."</p>
<p>It was still raining hard, but the sea remained smooth.
Personally, I thought it rather unwise not to wait for the
morning; but the Skipper was so anxious not to give the
pirates a moment's rest, and to start by sinking those
steamers or driving them ashore—to do anything, in fact, to
prevent them escaping—that the risk was probably worth
taking.  The steam pinnace had her fourteen-inch torpedo
dropping gear fitted, and the Skipper's main idea was to
blow holes in the steamer and the yacht, and so effectually
to prevent them moving.  Once more, it was not so much
our chief object to destroy the pirates or recapture the
yacht, as to rescue the little American girl and her father.
We hoped that we had now found where they were concealed,
and our first object was to prevent them being
smuggled away again.</p>
<p>We kept the boats in view till they disappeared in the
gathering dusk and the heavy rain, and then could only
wait for them to return.  It was so cold on deck, that I
went down to warm myself in front of the ward room fire.
Mayhew, the Fleet Surgeon, was sitting cosily in front of
it, and made room for me.  "Heard or seen anything?" he
asked.  "I shall have them all on the sick list if they ever
do come back.  I've never seen a night I should less like
to spend in an open boat."</p>
<p>I hadn't been there five minutes, when the quartermaster
came clattering down from the quarterdeck in his dripping
oilskins and sea boots.  "We can see some flashes ashore,
sir.  I think our boats are firing as well, sir."</p>
<p>Both of us ran on deck.  Several dull "booms" gave
us the direction in which to look, and every now and again
we could see the twinkle of a gun flash a very long way
off, generally a single one, then perhaps two or three
quickly, one after the other.  It was just as if someone a
hundred yards away was striking matches, which the wind
blew out as they were struck.  The reports came along a
few seconds later, and among them we could hear quite
distinct sharp cracks.  These were from our boats' guns, I
expect.  In spite of it being so wet, every soul on board
was on deck, staring through the darkness and the
incessant rain, to try and make out the boats returning.  We
ran a searchlight, throwing the beams vertically upwards
to guide them, and could do no more.  This beam lighted
up the raindrops, and made everything even more
depressing than it was before.</p>
<p>I only wish that all men were obliged to supply themselves
with oilskins or thick pea-jackets, for, as it was,
hardly one in twenty away in those open boats had them,
and I could imagine pretty plainly the state they were in
now.</p>
<p>By ten o'clock there was no sign of them whatever, and
I was very anxious.  Midnight came (I don't know what
foolhardy ideas hadn't occurred to me in the meantime),
and shortly afterwards we heard the sound of more guns,
and a muffled, long-drawn-out "boom", which made me
almost jump out of my skin, my nerves were so very much
on the stretch.  "That's a torpedo, sir," the signalman
said.  I didn't much care what it was; I really was so
thankful to know that they were still in existence.</p>
<p>The noises ceased almost immediately, and I again
trusted that they were on their return journey.  A long,
dreary wait followed, and then one of the people on the
bridge spotted flames from the steam pinnace's funnel.
We watched them flicker out every now and again,
drawing steadily nearer, and I sent down to Mayhew to have
everything ready in case there were any wounded.  Presently
she came close enough to hail, and to see that she
was towing the launch, sailing pinnace, the barge, and the
cutter.  She had a good deal of "list" to port, and I
thought at first that she must have been damaged, but
then saw, as she rounded up to come alongside, that she
had dropped her starboard torpedo, which accounted for it.
The boats ran alongside, and the Skipper came up the
gangway.</p>
<p>"What luck, sir?" I asked him.  "Where's the steam
cutter and the second cutter?  Anyone hurt, sir?"</p>
<p>His face was purple blue with the cold, but he was in
the highest spirits.  "Blown a hole in that tramp steamer;
made the little yacht run up inside the creek.  That's a
good beginning for 'Old Lest', eh?  Haven't had a man
touched, and left the second cutter and the steam cutter
inshore to come off at daybreak.  Got the galley fires
alight?" he asked, before he went below.  "The men are
pretty well dead with the cold and the wet."</p>
<p>"I'd thought of that, sir," I told him; "they shall have
some hot cocoa and pea soup directly they have fallen out."</p>
<p>I had never seen such a washed-out crowd of people as
clambered on board that night.  Even though those in the
boats had pulled their oars on the way off to the ship, they
were simply blue and shivering and stiff.  You may guess
that I got all the gear replaced, and the men dismissed to
their messes as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>When I went in to report to the Captain, he was standing
in front of his blazing fire in a thick dressing gown.
He had a great bowl of pea soup in his hands, and Blucher
was leaning up against his legs.  "Umph! that's good,"
he said, smacking his lips and rubbing himself.  "Warms
one's inside, eh?" and he roared to "Willum" to bring
his eighteenpenny Havanas, and made me smoke one: I
should have very much preferred a pipe.</p>
<p>"Willum" had been sent round to collect all those
officers who had been away, and they came trooping
in in all kinds of rigs, all looking jolly pleased with
themselves, and Willum served them out hot drinks,
and the Skipper said, "Here's luck to the little lass
and the old <emphasis>Vig</emphasis>," and when they were thoroughly warm
sent them all away to turn in.</p>
<p>"They're not going to turn in yet, sir," I told him;
"they are going to have a sardine supper in the ward
room."</p>
<p>"Umph!  Good idea that!  'Willum'," he roared,
"make me some sardine sandwiches, and put plenty of
onions in 'em."</p>
<p>"How about sending the steam pinnace inshore with
some hot soup for the people in the boats you left behind?"
I asked him, after he'd devoured a plateful of sandwiches
and had sent Willum for more.</p>
<p>"No good; couldn't find 'em in the dark.  I've stuck
'em right in under the guns, in the middle of the creek
which runs up there.  They've got to fire a Very's[#] light,
if the yacht tries to get away, so tell 'em to keep a good
lookout on the bridge."</p>
</section>
<section>
<empty-line/>
<p>[#] A Very's light is somewhat the same idea
as a Roman candle firework.  It
throws out one very brilliant ball of coloured light.</p>
<p>"It was grand work in those boats," he continued;
"they couldn't see us, and went on firing and wasting
ammunition.  I kept on running away in the steamboat,
easing off a few shells at them, and then going back
again, and they'd fire off twenty or thirty rounds where
she had been."</p>
<p>"I expect you had some pretty narrow shaves, for all
that, sir?"</p>
<p>He growled out "Umph!" and winked at me very slowly.</p>
<p>Now that he and I were alone, I saw that he had something
which he wanted to tell me, and when presently he
had sent Willum to bed, he lighted a fresh cigar and
began.  "You know that man Hoffman?  What d'you
think of him, eh?"</p>
<p>"I can't quite say, sir.  Can't quite 'place' him."</p>
<p>"What would you say if I told you he <emphasis>is</emphasis> the pirates—bosses
the show, or did.  What d'ye say to that?"</p>
<p>I supposed I looked surprised.  I certainly felt so.</p>
<p>"He's told me all about it.  He is running this show, or was."</p>
<p>"What d'you mean, sir?" I could hardly understand him.</p>
<p>"It's this way, Truscott," and, puffing his cigar, and
grunting and growling, the Skipper told me the most
extraordinary yarn I had ever heard.</p>
<p>Hoffman had for years owned quite a small fleet of
merchant steamers, and had endeavoured to compete
with the native junks for the coastal trade between
Ningpo, Shanghai, and the Chusan Archipelago.  Local
prejudice and the hatred of the white foreigner had been
too much for him, and he had failed.  The idea then
occurred to him that if he could make a clean sweep
of the merchant junks throughout the islands, he would
have the monopoly of the carrying trade.</p>
<p>"That explains why we have seen so many small
steamers about lately," I burst out, absolutely
dumbfounded.</p>
<p>"Umph!  It does," the Skipper nodded, and went on
to tell how Hoffman had built and armed a fleet of large
junks, and carried out the raids of which we knew so well.</p>
<p>"But what's he doing now?" I exclaimed.  "Coming
on board here half starved?"</p>
<p>The Skipper explained.  "That rascally skipper of the
yacht was his first lieutenant.  It was he who did most
of the work, headed most of the expeditions, and thought
himself as big a 'pot' as his master.  He thought he
would strike out a new line for himself, too, and
kidnapped Hobbs and Sally.  Thought he'd get enough
ransom to make his 'pile' in one swoop."</p>
<p>The Skipper went on to tell me that this wasn't
Hoffman's idea of doing business, and that it was owing to
him that they escaped, that time they were picked up
by the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.  It meant finally breaking with the
Englishman, and (Hobbs told us, I remember, that he
had heard a scuffle that night) they actually had come
to blows, Hobbs and his daughter being shoved off
alone in the boat during the confusion.</p>
<p>Next morning Hoffman had found himself practically
a prisoner.  Nearly the whole of the Chinese sided with
the good-looking scoundrel, who had so often led them
on their forays, and the German had to clear out, and
was lucky to find a junk whose crew remained faithful
to him.  That is how he first came to Tinghai, and it
was there that he saw Hobbs and his daughter for the
first time.  The girl reminded him of his wife, or daughter,
at home in Germany.  He hadn't seen either of them for
twenty years, and the daughter would have been about her
age.  At any rate, whatever it was that made him take
such a fancy to her, he wasn't going to let her fall into
that chap's hands again.  Directly he had heard of the
raid at the Tu Pu Monastery, he had gone across to
endeavour to regain his influence over his men, found
that impossible, but learnt that they were going to raid
Tinghai itself and kidnap Hobbs and the girl again.  He
had come back in his junk as fast as he could, but too
late to save her.</p>
<p>That accounted, then, for his sudden appearance at the
burning Mission.  He had landed in the same bay as the
pirates themselves, an hour or more behind them, and
rushed up to the Mission, but too late to save her.</p>
<p>"Travers says that he saw two boats there, sir.
Probably those were the two close together, and probably
Hoffman's made that third mark we saw farther along
the shore."</p>
<p>"Dare say it was," the Skipper grunted; "and he tells
me, too, that he got away about half an hour after they
had left."</p>
<p>"Trevelyan is a regular Sherlock Holmes," I said.  "I
must tell him; he'll be very pleased."</p>
<p>But the Skipper scowled and growled, "No, no; I
don't want anyone to know yet;" and went on with his
yarn, whilst I listened, wideawake enough, you may be
sure, although it was past two in the morning.</p>
<p>"Hoffman thought that the people at his dépôt in the
Chung-li Tao Group would still stand by him, so packed off
there," the Skipper went on to tell me, "and found the
old Scotch engineer in charge of the place.  It was this
man who had separated him and the Englishman—that
night they fought.  He was a friend of his, and gave
up the place and the junks; and everything was going
well, till one morning the Englishman appeared off the
town, fired a few rounds from the tramp steamer, the
junks' crews wouldn't fight, and Hoffman had to
surrender.  He was eventually taken to the Hector Group,
and kept there till he managed to escape to us again."</p>
<p>"Travers heard some fighting, but never saw Hoffman,"
I interrupted.</p>
<p>"Well, Hoffman was hardly likely to give himself away
by interviewing him.  At any rate, that was the reason he
gave me when I asked him," the Skipper said.  "He was
waiting until he felt more sure of his people before trying
to get him away—he couldn't trust any of them—and the
chance never came."</p>
<p>"By the way, sir," I said, suddenly remembering that
he had not come back, "where is he now?"</p>
<p>"Umph!  I left him and one of his Chinese fellows in
the boats.  They're going to try and get ashore to-night
at low water, find their way across the mud, and see if
Sally and Old Hobbs are still there.  The boats are to
wait for them for half an hour after daybreak.  If
Hoffman and his man don't turn up then, the boats have
to come back to the ship, and I've told him I'll have
another waiting at the back of the island for him.  There's
a big rock somewhere there—can't mistake it, he says—and
I want you to send a boat round there in case he can't
get back this side."</p>
<p>"He's not strong enough for much hard work, I fear,
sir," I said.</p>
<p>"'Fraid not, Truscott; 'fraid not."</p>
<p>"Whenever did you know all about this, sir?" I asked.
I was a little nettled that I hadn't been told before.</p>
<p>"Only this morning," the Skipper replied; he was
lighting his third cigar since coming back.  "Only this
mornin'—couldn't keep it to himself any longer—came
and told me.  Umph!" (I suppose that he saw I looked
as if I might have been told too) "I'd have told you then,
Truscott, but I wasn't certain of him till to-night, and
wasn't going to let you think 'Old Lest' had had his leg
pulled again, if he turned out a wrong 'un."</p>
<p>"What happened to-night, then, sir?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Directly they saw us coming along, the yacht began
to push inland—close up to the town, up a bit of a creek—and
just as it was getting dark, we saw the tramp steamer
trying to do the same.  I wanted to shove along after
them, but he wouldn't let me, said we should have to
pass within twenty yards of a battery, and they had had
plenty of time to man the guns.  He said it didn't matter
either, as the tramp couldn't get up there, and would be
aground before she'd gone fifty yards.  He promised to
find her, too, later on, and I took him at his word.  They
blazed off a few rounds at us, I kept 'em busy for a few
minutes, and then lay off, out of sight, as if I'd gone back
again."</p>
<p>"I didn't know what had happened, sir, when I could
neither hear nor see anything of you.  I was in a bit of a
'stew' when you didn't come back.</p>
<p>"I wanted to go and torpedo her, but he wouldn't let
me.  Said she'd be half out of water in another two hours,
and he'd do the job then, without getting into danger."</p>
<p>"He did, too; guided us in—how he did it, beats me—somehow
or other got her in between us and the battery,
and we let rip a torpedo right into her bottom, just
amidship.  We weren't fifty yards away, and not a soul saw
us till we'd fired.  I tell you, Truscott, that man's straight.
'Old Lest' don't often make a mistake when he's sized
a man up and seen him under fire.  He's as straight as a
die.  It was his own steamer he blew up."</p>
<p>"Well, he's the first man's advice you've ever listened
to, sir," I said, smiling.</p>
<p>"Umph!" he growled, "but 'mum's' the word;" and
he patted old Blucher, who was squatting between his
knees and yawning.</p>
<p>"If he can't get back to that cutter—and I don't know
how the dickens he means to do so—he'll go across to the
back of the island."</p>
<p>"What boat shall I send, sir?" I asked, getting up, for
it was time to be off; it was nearly three in the morning.</p>
<p>"Send the other cutter, and Trevelyan; I believe in
that chap," he growled.  "Umph!  You are going to turn
in, eh?  Umph!  All right!  I'll write home to the Missus
and the Admiral.  Don't know when I can send 'em.  Umph!"</p>
<p>"Have you read Rashleigh's report?" he asked me, as I
was going out.  "I've read it again.  He don't say much
about Trevelyan and Ford."</p>
<p>"No, he doesn't, sir; and I've heard their accounts.
They throw rather a fresh light on the loss of the two
junks.  Well, perhaps not quite that, but they seem to
have done better than we thought."</p>
<p>"Umph!  Good night!  Tell 'em to send their reports
to me—to write 'em."</p>
<p>I left him lighting a fresh cigar—a marvellous old chap
he was—and warned Trevelyan and his boat's crew before
I turned in myself.</p>
<p>On deck they had seen nothing of the two boats, still
remaining inshore, and I felt extremely sorry for the
drowned rats in them.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER X</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vigilant under Fire</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A Foolhardy Undertaking—"Who's Captain?"—Mr. Trevelyan
Returns—Taking Precautions—The Skipper's Plans—A
Ticklish Job—The Commander's Show—The Skipper's Few Words</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Commander Truscott</emphasis></p>
<p>I sent Trevelyan away an hour before sunrise, and told
him where to lie off and wait for any sign of Hoffman and
the Chinaman—they were to wave a piece of red bunting—and
then turned in for another forty winks, and was
called as it grew light.  I went up to the fore bridge and
found the Skipper already there.  He was smoking, even
at this hour, and looked as fresh as paint, although he
probably had had no sleep at all.</p>
<p>Hardly had I reached the bridge before we heard guns
firing again, strained our eyes to see what was happening,
and presently saw the steam boat puffing towards us, with
the second cutter in tow.</p>
<p>"Get their breakfasts ready for 'em, Truscott; they'll
want 'em, and 'Old Lest' wants his too;" and he went
down below.</p>
<p>In twenty minutes the boats ran alongside, and pretty
well worn out all the people were.  Hoffman was the first
to come aboard.  I have never seen such a dirty object in
my life.  He was covered with mud from head to foot;
even his face and hair were caked with it.  He looked
terribly exhausted.  I felt a strange feeling of curiosity
in speaking to him, now that I had learnt his history and
the part he had played in shaping the events of the last
two months.  "Found out whether they are still there?"
I asked him anxiously; but he shook his head, "Couldn't
do it; too weak, Commander; had to give it up."</p>
<p>The Captain coming up then, took him down below.</p>
<p>"Brought back the steam cutter and the second cutter,
sir," Whitmore reported.  "I waited as long as I could,
but that Chinaman never came back, and I daren't stay
any longer, sir, as they began to plank shots all round us."</p>
<p>"What happened to Hoffman?" I asked.  "He looks
as if he had had a bad time."</p>
<p>Then Whitmore told me that Hoffman and his Chinaman
had tried to get across the mud flats at low water, and find
their way ashore in the dark.  It was a foolhardy
undertaking, because Hoffman was evidently not strong enough;
but they lashed flat pieces of wood to their boots.
Whitmore ran the cutter's bows into the mud, and they had
crawled overboard and soon disappeared.</p>
<p>Whitmore backed the cutter into deep water and waited
for them to return, and in about half an hour had heard
a cry coming out of the darkness and had answered it, and
rammed the boat into the mud again.  Presently Hoffman
came stumbling back, falling and scrambling to his feet,
and floundering through the mud.  He had lost one of his
flat pieces of wood, and was unable to reach the shore.
Sending on his Chinaman, he had tried to retrace his steps,
and had had an awful time before he heard their hail.  He
only just had sufficient strength to get back to the boat,
and had to be hauled in.</p>
<p>"That Chinaman didn't come back at daylight, sir.
I don't know how he intended to do so, but, at any rate,
we saw nothing of him."</p>
<p>I told him that Trevelyan had gone round to the back of
the island, in case he tried to get off there.</p>
<p>"I hope you don't think I shoved off too soon, sir?"
Whitmore asked me anxiously.  "We were very nearly
hit several times—as it was."</p>
<p>"My dear chap, of course not.  Go down, have a hot
bath and some food; you look as though you wanted both
pretty badly.  You've not had much of a time, I should
fancy."</p>
<p>"I've never spent such a night in my life," Whitmore
said, and I could quite believe him.</p>
<p>"That steamer is as safe as 'eggs', sir.  She's right
over on her side," he called out as he went below.</p>
<p>That was one thing accomplished satisfactorily.</p>
<p>As it turned out, he might have waited for that Chinaman
till he was blue in the face—well, hardly that, for
he was already blue in the face, but till he'd been
sunk—because the Chinaman came off with Trevelyan a couple of
hours later.</p>
<p>The Skipper was waiting for his return before making
any plans; but long before that, something occurred which
thoroughly upset him.</p>
<p>We were all at breakfast, when suddenly we heard the
distant report of a heavy gun, and through the open
scuttles could hear the "swish, swish" of a shell.
Everyone jumped up and rushed on deck, the gunroom
people clattering up behind us.  "They've fired a gun
at us, sir," the midshipman of the watch told me.  "It
went right between the masts and fell over there, sir,"
and he pointed to where you could still see the spray of
the splash, just drifting to leeward, about four hundred
yards away.  "Don't think it was a shell, sir; no one
heard it burst."  He was extremely nervous and excited,
twitching all over.</p>
<p>The Skipper came up his ladder, red in the face and
indignant, and as he stepped on the quarterdeck there
was a shout from for'ard, "They've fired again, sir!"</p>
<p>Several people sang out, "Can see it, sir, coming
straight this way, sir!" a spout of water leaped into
the air, and, "whizzle, whizzle"—with that funny
whistling, whispering noise only a ricochetting projectile
makes—it passed overhead, and fell close to where the
first had fallen.</p>
<p>It was rather amusing to watch how our people "took
it".  One officer, whose name wild horses shouldn't drag
out of me, threw himself flat down on deck, several tried
to get behind each other, and most of them looked as
if they were—well—thrown off their "balance".  But you
should have seen the Skipper.  He stood there, with one
foot on the quarterdeck.  His mouth was wide open,
his face was absolutely crimson, his eyes stood out of
his head like lobsters' eyes, and his neck was so swollen
that it was a purple colour, and even from where I stood
I could see the veins standing out.  He actually couldn't
speak, he was in such a frightful rage.</p>
<p>"Close water-tight doors," I sang out, and "steam
on the capstan," not knowing what else to do, and then
went up to the Captain.</p>
<p>"Who's captain aboard this ship?" he managed to
bring out; "Old Lest or you?"</p>
<p>Then, pausing to take breath, he roared: "What
the—the—Jerusalem d'you mean by ordering steam on the
capstan?  D'you think 'Old Lest' is going to get up
anchor, and move off, because a lousy Chinaman fires a
gun at him?  Umph!  What's the range?"</p>
<p>"About eight thousand yards, sir."</p>
<p>"Well, he won't hit us," he growled, and with his field
glasses slung round his bull neck, he commenced tramping
up and down, scowling to left and right, as everyone
hurriedly cleared over to the port side to get out of his
way.</p>
<p>Two more shot—they certainly were not shell—came
along presently, one after another.  They were both a
long way short, and ricochetted overhead like express
trains.  He never turned his head to look at them, but
roared for me.  "See those darned youngsters leanin'
up against the quarterdeck rails!  See 'em—loafin' on
my quarterdeck!  Give 'em half an hour's extra drill
in the morning, and send them up to the masthead.  I'll
teach 'em to loaf."</p>
<p>I wanted to suggest clearing for "action", going to
"General Quarters", and sending them a few rounds
to quiet that gun, for a lucky shot of theirs might do
a lot of damage, and they must get the range before
long; but, to tell you the truth, I hadn't the courage
to do so.</p>
<p>"I'll teach 'em to loaf," he growled again.  "Sound off
'Divisions'."</p>
<p>The buglers rather nervously sounded off, and the men
began "falling in".  Pretty nervous they were, most of
them, especially those with their backs turned to the
shore; but they knew that this was "Old Lest's" way
of "showing off", and I could see them winking at one
another and grinning.</p>
<p>That was a "Divisions" with a vengeance.  It usually
lasted ten minutes, but this morning the Skipper, glaring
and snorting, went round each "division" himself, stalking
along and finding fault if a cap ribbon wasn't put on
correctly, or any small detail of the men's uniform
wasn't exactly to his liking; and there was no blinking
or shrinking—the men simply dare not—whenever another
boom was heard, and another shot came whistling past.</p>
<p>When he had at last finished, the men were all marched
aft on the quarterdeck, and the young Padré, pale and
nervous, and with half an eye for the shore, read prayers,
making many mistakes, at which the Skipper growled like
a bull dog.  I'm certain that one of those projectiles passed
not ten feet above us all, and it fell into the water not
twenty yards the other side; but not a scrap of notice did
the Skipper take, and presently they left off firing
altogether, much to our relief.  Then he growled out,
"Umph!  I said so," and went below.</p>
<p>In the middle of all this Trevelyan was sighted coming
back round the corner from the other side of the island,
and as soon as he came alongside, I saw that he had
the Chinaman on board, and looked happy.  "I've got
him, sir, and from what I can make out, Hobbs and Sally
are there all right.  A lot of those shot have been pretty
close, sir; I've been watching them all the way off.  I
wondered why you didn't fire back."</p>
<p>"Ask the Captain," I said, and took the Chinaman
down to Hoffman's cabin, where the Skipper joined us,
and we soon learnt the good news.  He had not been able
to communicate with them, but they were both safe, and
were kept well guarded in an old house, with a high wall
round it, just at the back of the town.  It was on a little
rising ground, and we thought we could actually make it
out from the ship through our big telescope.</p>
<p>The man had heard that Evans—that was the name
of the rascally Englishman—was laid up with fever.  The
town, he said, was in an uproar.  Hoffman told us that he
was always going down with fever, which generally lasted
for four or five days, and that probably a Swede, named
Jorgensen, was running the show.  "It's a six-inch
modern gun that they've got there," he said, "but
they haven't much ammunition, and no shell at all for
it; and it's just the mad, silly thing he would do, to
go easing it off at this long range."</p>
<p>Hoffman kept on imploring us to prevent Hobbs and
Sally being taken off somewhere again.  He felt sure
that Evans would try to do so, and told us that plenty
of junks were always lying in the creeks at the back
of the island, and could get away in half an hour, with
the wind as it was now blowing.</p>
<p>"Directly he is well enough he'll be off, and take
them with him.  He doesn't care a straw about anything
else, so long as he can force Sally to marry him, and
bleed the old father.  He won't wait for you to come
and try to capture them, you may be certain of
that."  Hoffman was so earnest, that he made us realize the
danger of the poor little girl being once more spirited
away by that unscrupulous villain, and how very urgent
was the necessity of losing no time in preventing this,
at all costs.</p>
<p>The breeze was still blowing dead on shore, so that
we were fairly certain that no junks could hope to beat
out from this side and escape.  The steam yacht dare
not come out during the day, and as he had done last
night, so the Skipper intended doing every night—leave
a boat lying almost in the creek itself to signal directly
she attempted to move.  Till the arrival of the gunboats,
we had nothing but the ship's boats to send round to
the back of the island to patrol; and the Skipper was so
impressed with Hoffman's earnestness, that he gave me
orders to "man and arm" the sailing pinnace, the sailing
launch, and the steam pinnace for this purpose.  I had
done this, and they were, in fact, just going to shove off,
when they reported that the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> was in sight.</p>
<p>The Captain belayed the boats and ordered Rashleigh
round there instead.  He had signalled, as he drew
near, that he had found the pirate dépôt deserted, and
not a junk of any sort or description to be seen, and
had therefore come along here at his utmost speed.
Whatever demerits Rashleigh may have had as a writer
of despatches, he certainly could not have turned up
at a more opportune moment, and we all felt grateful
to him.  I had forgotten to order Trevelyan and Ford
to send in their own reports concerning the loss of their
junks, but the arrival of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> reminded me of
the Captain's order, and I sent for them.  They were
both very bitter about the way in which Rashleigh had
reported on them, and I heard Ford say to Trevelyan
as they went away, "I'll write a snorter, sir."  As the
reports had to go through my hands before the Skipper
saw them, I knew that I should be able to "tone" them
down if necessary, so said nothing at the time.</p>
<p>The Captain was in great good humour now, and had
forgotten all about the firing and his morning's wrath.
"Hoffman tells me," he said, "that there are about a
thousand men ashore; got plenty of rifles, too, and
ammunition, and will probably put up a good fight.  So long
as Hobbs and Sally are safe, 'Old Lest' ain't going to
be hurried for nobody, and he's going to wait till the
other gunboats come along.  Can't do any more by
myself, Truscott."</p>
<p>Hoffman himself was down with fever, and, old Mayhew
told me, was pretty bad.  I met him coming out of the
cabin, and he held up a thermometer for me to look at.
I couldn't get the hang of it myself, but he told me it
marked 104 degrees.</p>
<p>"Get him on his legs again as soon as you can, old
chap," I said; but Mayhew shrugged his shoulders, and
he and Barclay went away together to yarn about him.
Thank goodness the other wounded people, young Morton
included, were doing well.</p>
<p>We took every precaution to prevent anything escaping
that night, and sent in both Hoffman's Chinamen, with
a couple of Very's lights apiece, with orders to try and
find out if any attempt was made to move Hobbs or his
daughter, and to fire them, down at the water's edge, if
any such attempt was made.</p>
<p>They were evil enough looking fellows, but Hoffman
swore that they were to be trusted, so we had to trust
them.</p>
<p>The night passed quietly, and early next morning the
<emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> arrived.  The latter was at once
sent round to assist the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> at the back of the island,
as her searchlight was much more powerful than the
<emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis>, and she would therefore be more useful there than
on this side of the island.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> also came along.  They
all reported that the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> had rounded them up,
and we felt very kindly disposed towards the melancholic
Chinese Captain, and Lawrence's chum, Ching, and hoped
they would bring the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> along to share our
adventures.  The <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> and <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> had left their
junks behind, and brought the crews and guns and stores
along with them, so that, I am glad to say, we had all
our people aboard once more.</p>
<p>We felt now that it would be impossible for anything
to escape from the island, and our feelings were much
relieved.  In fact, I think everyone felt sure now that it
would only be a matter of a few days before the pretty
little girl and her old father would be safe and sound on
board; and all day long there was a constant stream of
people going up to the fore bridge and looking through
the big telescope to "spot" the house where they were
imprisoned.</p>
<p>Directly the Skipper believed that the rascally Englishman
and his pirate crews were at last cornered and unable
to escape, he sent a letter ashore demanding the immediate
release of Hobbs and his daughter, and the immediate
surrender of the island.  Whoever was in charge of the
battery at the mouth of the creek respected the white
flag, and the letter was jammed in one of a row of
fishing stakes till some Chinese ventured out and took it
ashore.</p>
<p>It was a mere matter of form.  I do not suppose that
anyone imagined that the man Evans would comply with
either demand; and so it turned out, for he sent
back—the morning after, when the same boat went in
again—a most impudent letter, in which he stated that he was
going to marry Miss Hobbs, and "hoping that it would
not be necessary to hasten his marriage on account of
any attempts being made to prevent it", a threat which
infuriated the Skipper, and made us all feel extremely
distressed.</p>
<p>The Skipper told me what his general plans were.</p>
<p>Two brigades were to be formed, one under his own
command from the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and the other under the
command of Captain Parkinson of the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> from the
gunboats.</p>
<p>They were to disembark at the back of the island, behind
the town, at places about two miles apart, and were to
march inland as quickly as possible, get between the town
and that walled house, and join hands there.</p>
<p>He had not yet decided whether he would land at night
or during the day, but rather favoured daylight.  "Like
to see where I'm goin', Truscott.  'Old Lest' ain't a
badger."</p>
<p>This was the general idea, but to make certain that
no chance should be left of Sally and her father being
spirited away, the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> were ordered to
destroy every junk and boat they could find in the three
little creeks on their side of the island.</p>
<p>At the same time the <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> and <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> were
ordered to anchor as close in to the town as they could,
to make escape impossible from there.  They weighed
anchor, and proceeded to take up their station inshore,
directly after the receipt of the Englishman's letter, but
had not steamed within five thousand yards of the town,
when the six-inch opened fire on them.  We watched
anxiously, and saw that the first shots were very wild.
They steadily kept on their way, and, unfortunately,
almost directly afterwards, the <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> was struck in
the bows, and we could see was badly damaged.  It was
very awkward to know what to do, because the little hill,
and the house in which Sally and Hobbs were imprisoned,
were directly behind the six-inch gun, and might be damaged
if they tried to return the fire.  Their little four-inch
guns were not of much use at that range, being very old
and very inaccurate, and their erratic shells might have
fallen anywhere.</p>
<p>The Skipper swore angrily, and ordered them to return,
which they did, followed by six-inch projectiles, until they
were well past us.  It was a very anxious and exciting
few minutes, because a single lucky shot would have
sunk either of them, and many were falling extremely close.</p>
<p>We could see the hole in the <emphasis>Goldfinch's</emphasis> foc's'tle as she
steamed up, and she signalled for medical aid, and that
she had two men killed and four wounded.  The Skipper
cursed roundly, and sent Mayhew and Barclay across to her.</p>
<p>"You'll land and destroy that gun to-night, Truscott,"
he turned to me and growled out.  "I daren't fire at it
for fear of hurting the little lass, and I'm not going to
have it interfering with my plans.  Take what men you
like, and make what plans you like, and blow it up.
Umph!" and he went across to see what damage had
been done aboard the <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis>.</p>
<p>This rather staggered me—I'd not been expecting
anything of the kind—but I had sense enough to stammer
out, "Thank you very much, sir," before he went away,
and went off to find Whitmore, and to get Hoffman to
assist us as well.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>
PLAN OF CREEK.  (HECTOR ISLAND)</p>
<p>
<emphasis>PLAN OF CREEK.  (HECTOR ISLAND)</emphasis></p>
<p>Whitmore was wildly excited; but he is a good deal
younger than I am, and hasn't a wife to worry about, and
I have, and a couple of youngsters too, which makes a
good deal of difference.</p>
<p>Hoffman shook his head when he heard of the job, but
gave us all the information he could.  The six-inch gun,
he told us, was mounted behind an open earthwork, on
some rising ground, about five hundred yards from the
little battery at the water's edge, the one that had fired
at our boats on the first night.</p>
<p>He drew the rough plan which I show you opposite, and
which I have lettered, so that you can understand more
easily where we had to go and what we had to do.</p>
<p>Our first idea was to land clear of the battery and
advance straight towards the six-inch gun; but Hoffman
said that there were many native fishermen's huts all along
the beach, and that we should wake their dogs before we'd
gone five yards.  Even if we did get past them, the ground
between was a swamp, and after the continuous downpour
of the last few days we should never get through it at
night.</p>
<p>He sent for his Chinamen to help him, and apparently
they were of the same opinion.</p>
<p>"How about landing on the other side of the island
and approaching it from the rear?" I asked.  He shook
his head.  "There are huts all over the island, and where
there are huts there are dogs, and you'd wake every dog
for miles.  There's not the faintest chance of your rushing
it and surprising the people there."</p>
<p>I scratched my head.  I didn't like the job a little bit;
but the Skipper had said it was to be done, so that was
the end of it—it had to be done.</p>
<p>Whitmore suggested landing abreast the battery and
rushing that.</p>
<p>Hoffman thought that could be done easily enough,
though it was hardly worth it, in his opinion, as the guns
were useless old smooth-bores.  He was evidently afraid
of irritating the people.</p>
<p>"If once they get out of hand," he said earnestly, with
a haggard expression on his thin face, "they'll rush that
house and murder Hobbs and little Sally."</p>
<p>Whitmore hadn't intended merely rushing the battery,
but had thought out an entire scheme.  One party was
to rush the farther end of it—the right-hand end of it—the
one opposite the fishing stakes, and they were not to
try to do it silently, but to draw any fellows there towards
them, whilst another party slipped round the left end and
made their way up to the six-inch gun with a gun-cotton
charge.</p>
<p>"The ground is all right if you could find your way
in the dark," Hoffman told us.</p>
<p>"Why not send one of your fellows?" we suggested;
but he said he couldn't trust them, couldn't be sure what
they would do under fire, and besides, they were not
natives of the place, and wouldn't know the way.</p>
<p>There are any number of small huts and fences and
pitfalls there, and you could never get past them in the
dark.</p>
<p>I had enough experience of Chinese villages to recognize
that it would be a jolly ticklish job.</p>
<p>We left him then—he looked too ill to be worried any
more—and went back to my cabin, taking his rough
drawing with us.</p>
<p>The landing seemed easy enough—it was the getting
back again which worried me.  The party who held the
right end of that battery would have to hold it for at least
forty or fifty minutes; the destruction party couldn't
possibly find their way up to the gun, disable it, and return in
less time than that.</p>
<p>"It has to be done," I said finally, "and your way
seems the best.  We'll do it."</p>
<p>I don't mind confessing that I had never run a "real"
show previously.  Plenty of times I had worked out
schemes, and carried them through successfully, at
manoeuvres and things like that; but it was very different
now, and I devoutly wished that the Captain hadn't put all
the responsibility on my shoulders, and, without really
meaning to do so, I more or less shifted it on to Whitmore's.</p>
<p>Whitmore wanted to land at nine o'clock, an hour
before high water, so that we should have firmer ground
under us, be able to get closer in to the battery, and have
less trouble with the boats.  I, however, thought the
early morning the best time, somewhere about three
o'clock, for my experience in manoeuvres and sham
attacks had taught me that the attacked side was generally
at its worst, and that men, all the world over, were more
likely to be surprised and "shaken", at that hour.  It had
the disadvantage of being at low water, but we should
have those fishing stakes to guide us.  Hoffman had told
us the mud was fairly firm there, and, perhaps what
appealed to me most, daylight would not be far off.</p>
<p>Whitmore eventually gave way, and we decided that
we would leave the ship at about 1.30 a.m., be towed
as far as possible, and pull in with muffled oars.</p>
<p>Then it was a question of what men I should take, and
I decided to take Marshall[#] and his forty marines.  Speaking
generally, they were an older lot of men than a seaman
company, and the older the men were, the less liable they
would be to lose their heads.</p>
<p>[#] Captain S. A. Marshall, R.M.L.I., was in command
of the detachment of Royal Marines.</p>
<p>It was decided that I should rush the battery, and that
Whitmore should take twenty picked men and three
torpedo hands with the gun-cotton charges and try and
make for the gun.</p>
<p>"How about midshipmen?" he asked.</p>
<p>I personally didn't want to take any; the job was too
risky a one.  However, we finally decided to take one
each, and thought we had better choose Rawlings and
Ford, as they had had some experience lately.</p>
<p>"Heads, Ford; tails, Rawlings," Whitmore said, tossing
a dollar; and Ford fell to me.  There was nothing to
choose between the two boys.</p>
<p>I am not going to weary you with all the details which
had to be thought out and prepared, but I will just say
this.  There is no possible similarity between preparing
for a landing party or a sham fight during manoeuvres
and preparing for the real thing.  When you are getting
ready for the first, someone comes along: "The Gunnery
Lieutenant's compliments, sir, and he doesn't want the
small-arm magazines opened this morning".  "All right;
very well," you say; so no ammunition is passed round,
you take it for granted that water-bottles are filled, and
a hundred-and-one other things which are essential in
active warfare.  Besides—and this is more serious than
everything else put together—for one you prepare as for
a football match, for the other you cannot help realizing
that the lives of the men actually standing there in front
of you, cheerfully getting ready, are to be dependent upon
your judgment.  If other people who have the same
responsibility are as keenly conscious of their own lack of
skill and experience as I was that day, I am very sorry
for them.</p>
<p>By six o'clock in the evening everything that Whitmore
and I could think of had been prepared.  The men had all
seen Hoffman's rough sketch, and all thoroughly
understood what was to be done.  They were thoroughly happy
too, and the Skipper sending up to tell me that he wanted
to say a few words to them, I fell them "in" on the
quarterdeck.  There was very little light, though enough to see
his great wrinkled red face.</p>
<p>"Landing party present, sir," I reported, calling them
to attention.</p>
<p>"Umph!" he said, speaking in his gruffest tones.  "You
went in last night, most of you, and blew a hole as big
as a house in that tramp.  You know why you did that,
and got wet skins doing it—to stop 'em taking away the
little lass, now I've cornered 'em.  To-night the
Commander is going to take you in to blow up that gun which
had the confounded cheek to fire on the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> the other
day, and killed two men aboard the <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> this forenoon.</p>
<p>"Umph!" he growled.  "Last time the Royal Marine
detachment went ashore there was a good deal of leave
breakin'.  I hope you'll all come back this time."  (The
men guffawed and chuckled.)</p>
<p>"Captain Marshall," he roared, and pointed to one of
the front-rank men, "have that man's hair cut before he
leaves the ship.  He's a disgrace to the detachment;" and
he went round and inspected them all.</p>
<p>"Well!  Umph!  Good luck to you!" and he looked
them up and down again, growled, and went below, the
marines all grinning with amusement.</p>
<p>I dismissed them.</p>
<p>"What a grand chap the old man is!" Marshall said.
"No wonder the men would do anything for him.  Hasn't
he a grand 'few words'?"</p>
<p>The rain had ceased, and the night showed signs of
being clear though cold, and the breeze was not strong
enough to make boat work difficult.</p>
<p>I tried to make Ford and Rawlings turn in directly after
dinner, but they—like the two young fools they were—were
much too excited to do any such thing.  I turned
in myself, but that drawing which Hoffman had made
seemed to haunt me.  Directly I turned my light out and
shut my eyes, I saw it, and even now, when I am much
worried, it comes before me as clearly as it did that night.</p>
<p>I couldn't sleep a blessed wink, and at one o'clock my
servant called me, bringing some cocoa and biscuits.</p>
<p>I had no appetite for anything, and it was so cold that
I shivered as I dressed.</p>

<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>I have so very much to tell you, that I hardly know where
to start; but I think that I had better begin where we met
the old <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> steaming away from Tinghai.  It was
simply grand to take Mr. Travers back to her, and to
go alongside her in the dark with everybody looking over
the side and cheering.  There was a very nasty sea running,
and they were a long time getting the wounded across;
but no one was hurt, and it was splendid to know that
Dicky would now be a jolly lot more comfortable than he
could be in the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.</p>
<p>They gave Jim and me a splendid "blow out" in the
gunroom, and we simply had a grand time.  There was
only one thing which made us miserable—the Captain
didn't seem at all pleased.  I had been so longing for
him to be pleased—everything I had done I had done
for him—and had been looking forward to what he would
say when I saw him, and when he knew that I had rescued
Mr. Travers.</p>
<p>It wasn't till after Mr. Rashleigh had gone away that
he spotted me.  I had been hanging about and getting in
his way on purpose, and when he growled out in a surly
manner, "Umph!  Lost my junk, have you, and four
good men—Umph!—and haven't got anything to show
for 'em either?" and turned away, I almost felt inclined
to blub, and Jim was just as miserable.</p>
<p>Mr. Trevelyan had been snubbed nearly as much, and
he was furious, and said, "That fat little beast Rashleigh
has been spinning yarns, that's what it is."  The Captain
was certainly rather nicer when he came down into the
gunroom after dinner and made a speech; but no one ever
says nasty things in a speech at that time of night, so it
didn't nearly "make up".</p>
<p>Still, everything else was so jolly, and it was so glorious
to know that Mr. Hoffman had escaped from the fire after
all, and that we had found out where Sally and her father
were, and that we were actually on our way to rescue
them, that we couldn't feel miserable for long.</p>
<p>Next morning Mr. Trevelyan sent for Jim and myself
in his cabin.</p>
<p>"I told you what it was," he burst out, red with rage.
"It was that overfed, bloated hog!  Look at his report!  The
Commander has just given it to me to read.  I'm going
off to tell him our side of the show," and he rushed off,
but came back again redder than ever.  "I'm to wait till
I'm cooler, as if I wasn't as cool as a cucumber in an ice
chest;" and he stamped about his cabin.</p>
<p>Later on, however, we were all sent for, one after the
other, and told the Commander our own accounts of what
happened, and some time afterwards were ordered to send
in our own reports in writing.</p>
<p>Neither Jim nor I went ashore with the Captain that
first night when he blew a hole in the tramp steamer, and
we knew that it was because he was still angry with us.
We would have given our skins to go; but we both
pretended that we didn't mind, and that as the night was so
cold and awfully wet, it was jolly lucky that we hadn't
gone.  We determined to have a jolly good feed, and then
turn in early and get a jolly good night's rest, and we
yarned with Dicky and tried to pretend that we were
having a good time.  It wasn't much of a success,
however, and we soon found ourselves on the fore bridge in
the rain, looking at the flashes and then waiting for the
"booms" from the guns with a beastly feeling inside,
because we weren't there ourselves.  We got just as wet
and cold as they did, almost.</p>
<p>I was more lucky than Jim, because I did have
something to do, and went with Mr. Trevelyan very early in
the morning to bring off Mr. Hoffman's Chinaman.  We
had to hang about near a big rock at the back of the
island, and directly it was light "stand by" for a piece
of red bunting to be waved from shore.  We must have
been there for more than an hour, and thought that he
had either gone back to Mr. Whitmore in the steam
cutter, or perhaps been collared by the pirates.  When we
did see it wave, we fetched him off pretty quickly, and
shoved along back to the <emphasis>Vig</emphasis> just as hard as we could go.
You see, we were certain that he had good news, because
Mr. Trevelyan drew pictures of a thin little man and a girl
and showed them to him, and he seemed to understand,
and nodded his head and pointed to the island.  He kept
on saying "Vely good" all the way off to the ship.  I don't
think he knew any more English words.</p>
<p>On our way back we watched the six-inch gun firing,
and dropping her shells or shot all over the place.  Some
of them fell very close to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and we wondered
why Captain Lester didn't reply.</p>
<p>"How would you like to be there?" Mr. Trevelyan asked.</p>
<p>"Ra—ther!" I told him, and he smiled.  "It's all right
if you're doing something yourself, but it's a jolly different
thing when you're simply waiting for them," and that
made me think of my horrible funk when those two shore
guns had fired point blank at the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, and I was rather
sorry I had spoken.</p>
<p>Mr. Trevelyan laughed when he saw them all falling in
for "Divisions" on board the <emphasis>Vig</emphasis>.  "That's 'Old Lest' all
over," he said.  "I bet he's in a towering passion."</p>
<p>Jim told me afterwards that he didn't like the shooting
a little bit, and if they all hadn't been so afraid of the
Captain, they would have hated it all the more.  That was
the day we wrote our reports—the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> coming made
the Commander remember about them—and I put it all
down very clearly, how I had done my best to escape from
the four junks, and why I had been obliged to run down
through the middle of them.  I told exactly how I and all
those who were left of the <emphasis>Sally's</emphasis> crew had brought Mr. Travers
off in the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> cutter, and put in a lot about
Scroggs and Sharpe and all of them.  You see, I wanted
Captain Lester to get Scroggs's wife as big a pension as
possible, because of all the children.</p>
<p>I didn't want to say much about Dicky, because—well,
you know what I mean—I was only a very few places
senior to him, although he was only a cadet, and it
seemed so cocky.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trevelyan made me do it, and I explained it
all to Dicky.  Afterwards Mr. Trevelyan wrote some pretty
hot stuff too.  This was part of it: "With regard to the
alleged disobedience of the orders of Lieutenant and
Commander Rashleigh to proceed to the given rendezvous, I
considered that the information obtained from Midshipman
Ford of the <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> made it imperative that further and
more definite information should be obtained.  Your"
(that was Captain Lester's) "original orders to me were
to obtain such information at all costs, and I considered
this the opportunity to act upon them.  As a direct result,
I discovered the whereabouts of one of the headquarters of
the pirates, and indirectly was the means of the rescue of
Mr. Travers."</p>
<p>We took them to the Commander, who made us rewrite
them and "tone down" many things; but they were pretty
good "snorters" for Mr. Rashleigh, even after that.</p>
<p>The Captain must have thought that he had been a little
unjust, because later on in the day he saw me on the
quarterdeck and stopped me.  He glared at me for a
moment, and with his legs wide apart, growled out:
"Seem to have shown more sense than I thought.
Umph!  You'll do—some day," and left me feeling jolly
happy.</p>
<p>Of course when the <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> and <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> arrived,
Mr. Langham and Mr. Forbes and the midshipmen of the
other junks came back to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>.  They hadn't any
experience worth telling, compared to ours, except
Webster, who had managed to run his junk ashore, and the
<emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> had spent all her time getting her off again.</p>
<p>Jim and I nudged each other; we didn't like Webster.</p>
<p>Dicky didn't come off badly either.  You know that we
all called him "Dear Little Dicky", all except Jim, who
flatly refused to obey the Sub's order, and had been caned
twice by him for not doing so.  He was let alone afterwards.</p>
<p>Dicky hated it; it had made his life absolutely
miserable; and now Mr. Langham, as soon as he got back,
held a Court of Enquiry down in the gunroom about
our losing the junks.  I didn't care a snap what he thought
or said about it, nor did Jim.  The whole thing was only
got up for his amusement—his and Hamilton's (the big
Engineer Sub) and Webster's; but one of their "findings"
was this.  I copied the "rot" off the notice board
in the gunroom:</p>
<p>COURT OF ENQUIRY,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>
Held in the Gunroom, H.M.S. <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>
At Sea, <emphasis>April</emphasis> 7th.</p>
<p>As a result of the Court of Enquiry held last night
to enquire into the loss of H.M.S. <emphasis>Sally</emphasis> and
H.M.S. <emphasis>Ferret</emphasis>, Mr. Ford commanding the one and Mr. Rawlings
the second in command of the other, these officers have
been adjudged to have borne themselves with credit to the
gunroom, but are cautioned not to do so again.  It has
also been decided, affirmed, and we do hereby solemnly
declare, that Mr. Morton, hitherto known as Mr. Dear
Little Dicky, worked a Maxim gun so accurately, and
polished off so many niggers before he was knocked
over, stunned, incapacitated, and otherwise by flow of
his blood rendered <emphasis>hors de combat</emphasis>, that he is entitled to
some signal reward.</p>
<p>We do therefore proclaim, announce, and order that
from henceforth, evermore, and hereafter he shall be
known as "Dicky".</p>
<p>For "Dear Little Dicky" in future read "Dicky".
(This was in big print.)</p>

<p>

<p>Of course it was silly rot.  Still, so much silly rot goes
on in a gunroom, and a lot of it makes a difference—actually,
and nothing they could have done would have
made Dicky more pleased.  He still spent most of the day
in his hammock, but was allowed "up" for two hours
every afternoon in the gunroom.</p>
<p>He told Jim, on the quiet, that he quite liked going
there now.  He had hated doing so before, and used to sit
for hours on his chest outside, or wander about on deck,
because he so dreaded having his leg pulled, and hearing
himself called "Dear Little Dicky".</p>
<p>He could remember very little about the fight with the
junks, and nothing at all after seeing all those Chinamen
struggling in the water when that first junk sank.  He
didn't even remember Sharpe and me giving him that
hot milk during the night, and nothing till he was carried
up the side of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.</p>
<p>You may bet that Jim and I had plenty to tell him;
and we brought Sharpe along to back us up, because
I couldn't get him to believe, by myself, that it was his
Maxim gun which had done the trick when the first of the
four junks came along.</p>
<p>"I didn't fire it myself, though, Sharpe, did I?" he
asked; and Sharpe said, "No, sir, you didn't hardly do
that, but you was a-steadyin' of the cartridge belt, and
seeing as how it was 'fed' properly, and a-knocking back the
crank handle, and you was shoutin' and cheerin' like Billy
Loo, that you was, sir.  You was about the only one of us
who wasn't skeared, or—well—if you was, you didn't look
skeared," he went on, for he saw that Dicky wouldn't
believe him.</p>
<p>"We was all a bit skeared, eh, sir?" and he winked
his eye at me.</p>
<p>I knew jolly well that I had been.</p>
<p>The others all wanted to be very civil to him now, but
Jim and I boomed them off.  He belonged more or less to
us, and we weren't going to have them shoving their oars
in too quickly.</p>
<p>Jim and I were very excited when we heard that the
Commander was going to land with the marines and
try and blow up the six-inch gun.  We hung about
outside his cabin, and shoved ourselves under his nose
up on deck all the afternoon, so that he shouldn't possibly
forget us.  We expected that he would take one, if not
two midshipmen with him, and we didn't see why we
should not go, and you can imagine how badly we wanted
to go.  Everyone wanted to land with him especially, for
he was such a "ripper", and so jolly pleasant, and was
always "smoothing over" things when everyone was cross
and bad-tempered, and felt he wanted to bite everyone
else's nose off.  He was very strict "service", but he
never did small irritating things, and treated us Mids and
Cadets as though we were human beings; several of the
ward-room officers didn't seem to think so, quite.  He
had a great leathery face like the Captain's, and was
tremendously popular with the men.  We heard that he
had nothing but his pay to live on, and had a wife and
family to keep.  That was quite enough, the A.P. used to
say, to make any man solemn at times.  He did very often
look worried, but when anything was "doing", he was
always as "buckish" as any of us.</p>
<p>Nobody had ever seen him in a bad temper, so no one
ever minded having to report things to him.  If we had to
report anything, a light or a change of course, or anything
like that, we had often to screw up our courage before we
tapped at the Captain's door, for often he would nearly bite
our heads off.  It was jolly different with the Commander,
for time after time I have had to wake him, at night
or during his afternoon sleep, and he would say, "Right
you are, boy", as cheerfully as anything.  I remember
once he said, "No trouble to wake me, Ford, eh?" and
I couldn't help smiling, and he asked me what the joke
was, and I told him that I had just called the Captain,
and—well—he hadn't enquired very civilly whether I had
had trouble in waking him.</p>
<p>He knew all the Captain's family.  He used to go down
there to shoot, and had met my father and mother there
too, so that was probably the thing that just made the
difference when he had to choose a midshipman, because
he did choose me.</p>
<p>Wasn't that absolutely splendid?  And Jim was to go
with Mr. Whitmore; so we were both simply wild with
delight, and rushed down to tell everyone.  He had sent
for us in his cabin, and he looked very grim and sad when
we went there, but he didn't look quite so serious when
we left.  He was so amused at our being so jolly excited, I
expect; but we couldn't help that.</p>
<p>He had shown us the map thing which Mr. Hoffman had
drawn, and explained exactly what he was going to do; and
told us to take revolvers, not dirks or cutlasses, as they
would only get in the way, and to wear the boots with the
broadest soles, as we should have to wade through mud;
and as they would be slippery afterwards, to get big nails
put in them, because we should probably have to do a lot
of scrambling.</p>
<p>We were the only two midshipmen who were going
to actually land; but Withers was going inshore in the
barge, Jones in the first cutter, and Webster in the steam
pinnace.</p>
<p>Webster was to tow us in as far as he could go, and the
cutter and the barge were to wait for us after we had
landed, and in case they should be wanted to cover our
getting aboard again, a Maxim gun was mounted in the
bows of the barge, and another in the bows of the cutter.
The others were rather jealous of Jim and myself,
because, of course, we had only just joined the ship.  We
didn't care a tuppenny "rap" about that, however.</p>
<p>We sent for our bandsman servant, and he took our
boots away to one of the bluejackets who mended boots.
He hadn't the proper kind of nails—none left, at any
rate—but the ones he did put in were a jolly sight better than
none at all.</p>
<p>As it got dark, and the rain stopped and some stars
came out, and everything seemed to be promising well,
we were too excited to eat our dinner, and as to sleeping,
we couldn't possibly get a wink, and were out of our
hammocks directly it struck one bell (half-past twelve), long
before the sentry came round to wake us.  We had two
bits of candle all ready, and we dressed by their light, very
quietly, not to wake anybody, and then slipped on deck.
But of course we were much too early, and had to wait
a very long time.  However, it made us hungry, and we
ate a whole tin of gingerbread biscuits between us; and
when the rest of the people began turning out, and they
brought round hot cocoa, we had a jolly big whack of that.</p>
<p>Then they began "falling in", and the Commander came
up with a sword and revolver and haversack, yawning and
looking tired, and Captain Marshall, with his eyeglass just
showing in the lantern light, pulled on his gloves and
looked jolly much a soldier all over.  He had his long
sword hitched up to his waist, and his cap beautifully on
the side of his head, and his moustache all carefully trained,
and he winked at us with the eye that wasn't holding the
eyeglass.</p>
<p>We heard him start a yarn to Mr. Whitmore and
Dr. Barclay, who was coming with us as well, "When I was
the handsomest subaltern in the British army, my dear
chaps——" and they both laughed and "hee-hawed" till
the Sergeant-major came up, jerked his arm stiffly to the
salute, and reported the marines ready for inspection.  This
was the time we often waited to see, because he used
to change from being a funny man to a soldier, and we
always watched to see him snap his teeth together, shove
out his under jaw, look very fierce, and walk round his
men, looking as though he'd never had a funny thought
all his life, and was simply thinking of nothing but soldiering.</p>
<p>The Commander's grimness was gradually wearing off,
and when Captain Marshall had told him one or two funny
stories, and he had laughed several times, he became
quite cheerful.  The Captain came up, too, when
everything was ready, and he nodded at me, "Getting more
experience, Ford?" and stood under the quarterdeck
lantern, where everybody could see him, and growled out,
"Good luck, men!  Hope to see you all back by
daylight."  The boats had dropped alongside by this time, and
we all began to file down into them.  Jim gave me a
parting pinch, and went down the port side into the cutter, and
I went down the starboard side into the barge, with
the Commander and Dr. Barclay and the marines.  The
steam boat took us in tow, we picked up the cutter, and
began to move away from the ship.  I had just thought
how jolly it would be to have a send-off "cheer", when we
heard the Captain's voice roar, "Three cheers for the
Commander and the 'landing party'," and to judge by the
noise, I should imagine that everyone on board had turned
out and come on deck.  Without waiting for orders, we
started cheering in the boats, and as we passed the
<emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis> her people cheered us too.  It made my heart
go thumping like mad, and just did the right thing for
the Commander.  You knew, by the way he cheered, that
he had forgotten all his worries.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> was on the other side of the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,
and I don't know whether they cheered us or not.  She
still had those two dead men on board, so probably
didn't.</p>
<p>"They won't hear us ashore, I suppose, sir?" I asked
the Commander.</p>
<p>"Too far for that, Ford," he said, and sang out for the
men to carry on smoking.  The steam pinnace seemed
to make a tremendous noise ahead of us, but I expect
that that was only "fancy".  At any rate, we seemed
to bubble along jolly fast in the dark.  The stoker in
her, like the ass he was, must have been keeping up a
very big head of steam, because once or twice flames
came out of the funnel.  The Commander shouted for
them to ease down, and we had some difficulty in making
them hear.  I thought that they never would, and the funnel
was like a big torch, and could have been seen many miles
away; but at last they heard and eased down.  The Commander
ordered them to disconnect her fan, and after that
no more flames showed.  You see, the air is forced through
the fires by means of a little fan, worked by an endless belt
from the main engines, and when they are going fast
it blows the flames up the funnel.</p>
<p>If it had been the Captain, I know that he would
have been frightfully angry, and punished the stoker later
on; but the Commander only said, "The poor idiot was
doing his best", and was quite calm, although, of course,
it might have given the whole "show" away directly.</p>
<p>Although we went along much more slowly, the few
lights on shore were getting bigger and bigger.  Presently
the steam boat steamed very slowly, indeed, and then
stopped, and we ran alongside.  It was low tide, and we
had begun to get into the narrow channel, running up
the creek into the town.</p>
<p>Mr. Lawrence was in the steam boat—I had not seen
him before—and had been navigating us.  Then we heard
Mr. Hoffman's voice.</p>
<p>"Good heavens! what are you doing here?" the
Commander asked.</p>
<p>"I'm coming with you," he said.  "I will show Whitmore
the way up to that gun."</p>
<p>The Commander told him that he was not well enough,
and tried to persuade him to go back, but he absolutely
refused, and crawled across us into the cutter.  "I've
taken half a bottle of quinine, and shall be all right.  You
could never find that gun by yourselves."</p>
<p>We could see, even in the dark, how "shaky" he was.</p>
<p>Then Lawrence shoved off back again to wait for us,
the steam boat giving a few swirls with her screws, and
slipping away out of sight in a moment.</p>
<p>It was simply pitch dark, and when I tell you that
though Withers was sitting behind me, and had his
knees in my back, and yet I couldn't see his face when
I turned round, you will understand how dark it was.</p>
<p>We then started to pull inshore.  The oars had been
muffled by having strips of fearnought (thick flannel,
almost like felt, which the stokers make into trousers for
stokehold work) bound round them where they rubbed in
the rowlocks, and the rowlocks themselves had more
fearnought nailed all over them, so that they only made a soft
noise, with a squeak now and again.</p>
<p>We were quite close to the shore on our port side, and
one or two little streaks of light—I suppose they came
from the fishermen's huts—didn't look more than a
hundred yards away.</p>
<p>I was very nervous and excited, and when a dog
suddenly began to bark, and we could actually hear
him rushing down a loose stone beach close to us, my
heart seemed to stop beating with a jerk for a little time.</p>
<p>We lay on our oars, he gave one or two angry barks—they
seemed to be just outside the boat—and then we
heard him give a whine as though he was tired and
yawning, he scampered up the beach, gave a low growl, and
was quiet.</p>
<p>We went on again, but it was so dark that the Commander
crept for'ard into the bows, and we felt our way
very slowly along the edge of the mud, shoving her off
with boat hooks whenever we got too close.</p>
<p>We had passed some of those lights—they were right
behind us now—so that I knew we were well up the creek.
We couldn't see where the water ended, but farther away
it was blacker still, and I knew that this was the steep
beach and the shore behind it.  I tried to remember that
drawing, and hung over the side and tried to make out
those fishing stakes.  We seemed to go on like this for
a very long time—we were pulling very slowly against the
last of the ebb tide—and then the blackness on our left
seemed to get nearer and more upright, and I knew that
we must be almost abreast of the battery.  I couldn't see
Mr. Whitmore's cutter, and could very seldom hear it,
although we knew that it was very close behind us.
A few dogs were barking somewhere inland.  There
was one, away on our right, howling every minute or
two, a most creepy kind of howl, and there were two
who answered him on our side of the town.  Sometimes
others would join in, and you would almost recognize the
different barks.  I longed for them to leave off.  That was
the only noise, except the slight splash as the oars dug into
the water, and the soft thump against the sides of the
row-locks as they dragged them out; but now that we were
listening so hard, and were so excited, even this seemed
to be very great.</p>
<p>Then something scraped against our bows and knocked
the low oars, and the noise seemed awfully loud and startling.
A lot of the men let out "Oh!" under their breath;
they were so excited and jumpy.  I don't wonder either,
because the marines were simply sitting on the thwarts,
with their rifles between their knees, and they had nothing
to do except to prevent them rattling against anything.</p>
<p>We hauled ourselves up, and the Commander came aft,
leant over the side and felt it, and the coxswain, who
had been there before with the Captain, felt it too, and
he whispered to the Commander that it was one of the
fishing stakes.</p>
<p>We pulled to the side and came across some more, so
felt sure.</p>
<p>The dark mass of the cutter came quite close to us.</p>
<p>"I've found the first line, the second is fifty yards farther
on; you go back about thirty yards," the Commander
whispered across to Mr. Whitmore.  There were a few
click, clicks, and the cutter disappeared again.  We
started to pull out round that first line of stakes, but
we had made more noise with our oars, knocking against
them—the men couldn't help that—and suddenly, right
over our heads, it seemed, someone yelled out.</p>
<p>I clutched hold of Captain Marshall's arm—it was the
first thing my fingers touched—and I heard him give
a gulp; but the Commander "hissed", and we lay on
our oars and held our breath.  It must have been a
sentry or a watchman, and he sang out again, and I
felt as if I was throbbing all over.  Then we heard him
muttering to himself.  The tide had taken us clear of the
stakes, and the Commander whispered "to give way", and
we pulled round the end one without hitting it; but the
sentry could hear the oars, and sang out again.  The men
began to pull faster, and the oars made an awful noise.
More Chinamen began shouting—one quite a long way in
front, and then several more.</p>
<p>"Starboard!" I heard the Commander say; "starboard,
hard!" and then knew that in another half-minute
we should be scrambling ashore.  I crept along
to the bows with the Commander, to be ready to follow
him.  We had hardly got there when the bows ran into
the mud with a jerk, and I had to hang on to the gun
mounting to prevent being knocked over.  "Keep on
'giving way', Withers!" the Commander sang out,
and slipped down into the water without the least
hesitation.  It was up to his waist, and he held out a hand for
me.  I fell in after him up to my armpits, with my feet
sinking in the beastly mud at the bottom.  I was so
excited, that I didn't notice how cold it was; but it just
flashed through me how Captain Marshall could do it,
with all his beautiful uniform on, and then I found
myself wading after the Commander, and pulling my feet
out of the mud.  There was enough noise now to wake
anybody.  No one could help the rifles and everything
else knocking against the side of the boat, and the
splashing, and the men cursing under their breath.
There were some frightened cries above us, and a rifle
was let off (it sounded like a six-pounder), and all the
dogs in the town seemed to start barking; but we were
all too excited and busy getting through the water and
mud to notice much.  In half a dozen steps the water
was only up to my knees, and in two or three more
I dragged my feet out on to firm mud, and started to
break into a kind of "splodgy" trot to keep up with
the Commander—I could only just see his dark figure,
and had to keep close for fear of losing him.</p>
<p>Then the beach began to slope up, and was quite hard,
and we ran over a lot of shells and loose stones, the water
running off me and squelching inside my boots.  I was out
of breath and panting, and my clothes had all stuck to me,
especially my trousers over my knees, and the Commander
wouldn't stop, and never once looked back to find out how
many men were following.  He seemed to disappear in a
very black shadow; but it was only a bank about four feet
high, with stiff grass on the top, and he helped me, and
someone shoved me, and I got a lot of sand or earth in my
mouth, and spat it out.  The Commander stopped for a
moment, and I was only too glad to get back my breath.
We could see some lights moving backwards and
forwards, and appearing and disappearing at regular
intervals, and knew at once that men were running about
inside the battery, and that they shone out when they
passed one of the gun embrasures.  There was any
amount of calling and shrieking going on.  The
Commander drew his sword, I saw Captain Marshall close
to me with his sword drawn, any number of dark figures
kept scrambling over the bank; the Commander yelled,
and we all yelled and rushed straight ahead.</p>
<p>Several people behind me fell—I heard them—and I
heard Captain Marshall cursing, and asking "Where the
blooming buttercups his eyeglass was?" and then there
shot out from the dark wall a most tremendous flame,
with an awful roar—they had fired one of the guns.  It
seemed as if it was almost in our faces, and I turned
my head half round, and the flame lighted up the men's
faces just for a moment.  It showed us all the outline of
the battery as well, and, what was better, a little path, and
we raced along it, cheering like mad.  I think that they
must have been firing at us with rifles as well, but I don't
know, and the next thing I remember was clambering up
a stone parapet, with someone's feet in my face, which I
hardly noticed at the time, digging my nails into some
cracks, and then getting my arms round something hard
and round.  I "muscled" up, and found it was one of the
little guns, and knew I was in one of the embrasures.
"Get along, curse you," someone yelled; "give me a
hand with this rifle," and scrambled up after me.  I
couldn't get down for a second, because there were so
many in front, and the man simply took a flying leap
past me.  He didn't know who I was in the dark.</p>
<p>I got down somehow or other, and then hunted for the
Commander, heard him shouting away to the left, and
got close to him again.  We were right inside the battery,
and we followed the wall—inside—all round, and not a
Chinaman was there.  We were all cheering like mad,
or panting for breath, and then we saw some lights from
huts fifty yards away, and crowds of Chinamen running
backwards and forwards in front of them, and heard
more yelling.  Without waiting for any orders,
everybody rushed towards them and carried me along too,
doing my best to keep with the Commander.</p>
<p>There weren't any Chinamen there when we got to the
huts, and the men were for rushing on, but the
Commander managed to halt them, and we could hear the
mob running away and making a squealing, frightened
noise, but couldn't see them.  Three yards away from
the lighted huts everything was simply pitchy black.</p>
<p>"Get back to the battery, boys!" the Commander
shouted; "they'll be coming back soon."  The men had
to fall "in" just inside the battery wall, behind the little
guns, and we found that no one was missing.</p>
<p>I don't think that the Commander knew quite what
to do then.  I heard him telling Captain Marshall and
Dr. Barclay that he wished the Chinamen had made a
fight of it instead of running away, because he feared
that they would simply bolt back to the six-inch gun,
and that Mr. Whitmore's party would never get to it.</p>
<p>Whilst we were waiting like this, I had time to notice
all the noises.  Talk about dogs!  I should have thought
that all the dogs in the world wouldn't have made so much
noise.  There must have been simply thousands of them
barking away all over the town; and some came running
out of the darkness into the light from those huts, and
we could see their eyes.  It was something for me to
do to throw stones at them, and the bugler boy—Wilkins—helped
me; they would howl if a stone went near them,
and rush away yelping.  It was jolly good fun doing this.
All of a sudden there was a dull crash behind us, as
if a heavy weight was rolling down outside the battery.</p>
<p>"What was that?" I heard the Commander shout,
rather nervously, and he went across, and I followed him.</p>
<p>"Very sorry, sir," the Sergeant-major said.  "Some
of the men chucked a gun over the wall, sir.  I've taken
their names, sir."</p>
<p>"Let 'em chuck them all over, sir," Captain Marshall
suggested; and we did.  We had them all—five there
were—tumbled in the ditch in no time.  Four men could
lift a gun, and if they couldn't heave it out of its wooden
carriage, another two would help them, and heave it over,
gun and carriage too.  The men enjoyed it, and so did
I, and we began pitching over the little round shot which
lay there in heaps, and some grape-shot done up in basketwork.</p>
<p>There was another wait after that, and we all were
bitterly cold.  My nose was running, and below the
waist I felt like ice.</p>
<p>The Commander still didn't seem to know what to do.
He had put a few men out past the huts to warn us
in case any Chinese came along, but it was so dark that
he couldn't see how the ground lay, or the best position to
take up, in case we were attacked.</p>
<p>Then Dr. Barclay had a brilliant idea, and suggested
setting fire to the huts.  "They'll light the place up and
dry our clothes, sir," he said.</p>
<p>"Right O!" the Commander chuckled, and it didn't
take many minutes before they were all of them blazing
away like fun.</p>
<p>The Commander said that I could help, so Wilkins and
I ran over to the huts, turned over a funny old lamp
burning inside one of them, and set fire to a lot of
shavings and straw.  The smoke drove us out, but then
we set fire to the outside in half a dozen places, and
soon had a grand blaze going.  It was jolly comforting
to stand there and feel our clothes drying, though the
wind would puff the smoke back into our eyes sometimes.</p>
<p>"Fifth of November, almost, ain't it, sir?" Wilkins said.</p>
<p>"And there go the fireworks, too," he shouted; and
there was a banging and spluttering in the hut next to
ours, and little bits of it flew about.</p>
<p>"Those are cartridges going off," the Commander
shouted, running up.  "Clear out of it, men."</p>
<p>They had begun to move away, and, when he called,
moved faster; we'd hardly got clear before there was a
tremendous "hurroosh", and the whole hut seemed to
go right up, and burning planks, strips of thatch and
matting, went flying along through the air, and began
blazing away wherever they fell.  My aunt! it did make
a smoke, though there wasn't much noise, only a very
loud "poof", and everyone went scampering back to the
battery with his head down, trying to dodge the bits.
We did laugh.</p>
<p>"Funny place for their magazine, eh, Commander?"
I heard Captain Marshall chuckle; and we all kept pretty
clear of the others.  The explosion had made the dogs
stop barking—just for a few seconds—just time for us
to hear noises as if the townspeople were waking up at last.</p>
<p>"They're getting 'busy' over there," Captain Marshall
said.  "That sounds as if our friends would be coming to
call on us shortly."</p>
<p>I think that the Commander and he wanted them to
come very badly, and I didn't mind either, because I
wasn't so cold now, and the flames lighted the place
all round grandly.</p>
<p>They walked all round the lighted-up part, and decided
that the best position for the men would be standing on
the shore of the battery wall, firing over that, and for some
men to stand on the beach, farther along, at each end,
and fire over the bank which we all had to climb over.
We couldn't hear a sound of Mr. Whitmore's party; but
there was another strange noise like the quacking of
thousands of ducks—you could hear it even with the flames
roaring and crackling and the dogs barking.</p>
<p>"Whatever is it, sir?" Wilkins asked me; but I didn't
know, and asked Dr. Barclay.</p>
<p>"Bull frogs, down in the paddy fields below the six-inch
gun," he told me, and I didn't say any more, because
I thought that he was pulling my leg.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards, the Commander and Captain
Marshall and Dr. Barclay all went along past the huts—they
were having a look round—and Wilkins and myself
followed behind them.  The flames were between us and
the sea, and suddenly something whistled past me, and
I jerked my head round, and then there was the noise
of a rifle going off—and another—and another, and
flick—flick—flick—flick, the bullets went whizzing past us.</p>
<p>I put my hands up to keep them off.</p>

Notes—A Strange Reception—The Captain's Letter—The

the Rescue</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>Directly they started firing we all ran back to the huts,
because we were in between the Chinese and the flames,
and of course made splendid targets.</p>
<p>Captain Marshall sang out, "Run, Ford, run!" and I
did, and jolly fast too; but he and the Commander and
Wilkins, the bugler boy, only came along at a jog trot,
and "miles" behind me, and Captain Marshall was "hee-hawing"
as if he had never seen anything so funny before
in his life.  He asked me whether I had done the
hundred yards in ten seconds, or some rot like that, and
before all the men, too, which made me get very red
and simply furious.  It was all his fault for shouting out
"run", and with those bullets kicking up the ground and
flying past, I jolly well couldn't stop myself when once
I had started.  I don't think anyone could.  Do you?
I caught Wilkins grinning, and this made me more angry
still.</p>
<p>"Don't you worry; it was only Marshall's joke," the
Commander said.  He meant to be nice, but I knew that
he thought I ought not to have run, and I simply hated
myself.</p>
<p>I was so mad at being such a coward, that I think I
would have run straight at them if they had gone on
shooting, just to show the men that I could run just as
fast that way; but they had left off, and were only shouting
at us from the darkness behind the huts.  I felt most
horrid, and wondered what the Captain would think when
Captain Marshall told him.  I knew that he would tell
him—"hee-hawing" like a grampus, and thinking it a
tremendous joke.</p>
<p>"May I take six men out there, sir, out to the right,
creep round in the dark, and see if I can find them?  Do
let me, sir!" I blurted out, almost before I thought of it.</p>
<p>He looked at me very grimly, and must have seen that
there was something the matter (there was, very much
the matter—everything inside me was working), thought
a few moments, smiled at me, and said: "Right you are,
if you can get volunteers.  Don't go far, and come back
when I sound the 'close'."</p>
<p>Get volunteers!  Why, they all would have come, and
I just took the six nearest, I didn't really care who they
were, or if none of them came, I was so mad, and we
dropped over the battery wall, and then behind the bank
to the beach, and crept along in its shadows.  I could
just see the water jacket of the Maxim in the bows of
the barge lighted up by the flames, and they must have
seen our shadows and thought we were Chinamen, because
I heard Withers sing out some order, and if I hadn't
given the gunroom "whistle", I do believe he might have
tried to shoot us.  We crept along till we were clear of the
firelight, and then I told the marines what I was going
to do, extended them to three paces, and started to make
inland.  I knew pretty well where those rifles had
fired—I'd seen the flashes—and I didn't think that there were
more than seven or eight altogether, and meant to get
behind them, get the Chinamen between me and the fire,
and try and bag one or two.</p>
<p>I don't believe anything would have frightened me.
That silly "hee-haw" of Captain Marshall, and thinking
of running back so fast, simply shoved me along.  I
wasn't going to let that story get to the Captain and
to Mrs. Lester, and my mother and Nan, and all over
Upton Overy, without something else tacked on to it.</p>
<p>We crept up to a deserted hut, made a great noise
breaking our way through a fence behind it, and were
bothered by a lot of beastly dogs rushing at us, till I gave
one of them a jolly good "welt" in the head with my
boot, and they all ran off yelping.  We went scrambling
over rough ground, and stumbling over what seemed like
heaps of broken crockery, and then we came to a ditch.  I
was so "mad" angry, that I simply slid straight down into
it, and had to swim one or two strokes, and nearly got my
feet caught up by weeds; but I didn't care in the least, and
only worried lest my revolver cartridges were not water-tight.</p>
<p>Two of the men wouldn't face it, and went along the
side to find an easier place, and I never saw them again.
At the other side there was a high mud wall, and we
skirted along it till it came to an end, and then we
suddenly turned a corner and came upon four or five
men standing watching the flames.  They yelled and fled,
and we went after them as hard as we could go; but
they were running away from the flames, and were not
the men we wanted, so I pulled up, and waited till the
marines had got their breath.  Right away inland we
could hear a lot of rifle-firing and then some volleys.</p>
<p>"That's the Gunnery Lootenant an' 'is little lot, sir,"
one of the men whispered, and I recognized his voice.  It
was Martin, one of the sentries in the gunroom "flat".
We used to plague the life out of him.</p>
<p>We couldn't see the flames now, only a few sparks
rushing up, and thought that the fires must be dying
down; but I felt certain that we were right behind them,
and that those brutes who had made me run must be
close to us now.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>
CLOSE FIGHTING</p>
<p>
<emphasis>CLOSE FIGHTING</emphasis></p>
<p>I don't quite know why—it may have been because we
couldn't see the flames, or because I was wet through
and cold again, or because we could hear people running
about near us in the dark, without being able to see them—but
I forgot all about being so brave, and felt frightened,
and was jolly glad when I heard the bugle sound the
"close".  I wasn't certain which way to go, for I
funked that ditch, and didn't think we could have found
our way back there.  Whatever it was, we found ourselves
going straight towards the sparks, came up against
another wall, turned round the end of it, and then found
that that was what had prevented us seeing the flames.
They were still making a great light, and in between
them and us there was a crowd of Chinamen.  We could
see their heads showing like black discs, and they were
all jabbering together, with their backs to us.</p>
<p>I don't know who started—I didn't—but we all began
shouting and charging down at them.  They had just time
to turn round before we were on top of them.  The
men let off their rifles, and I pulled the trigger of my
revolver, and haven't the least idea whether it went off
or not.  They must have thought that all the demons
in the world were after them, for they opened out and
let us through; but directly we had rushed past and came
into the light, they saw that we were only five, and came
howling after us.  Right in front of me a man jumped
up with a rifle and let it off almost in my face.  He
didn't touch me, but probably hit some of his own
people, and before he could fire again I had hold of
the barrel with one hand, and was banging him in the
face with my revolver, though that didn't seem to hurt
him.  He was just going to pull the rifle out of my hands,
when I heard Martin curse and swing his rifle down on his
head, and he fell so suddenly that I fell on top of him.</p>
<p>Before I could get up again, someone had thrown himself
on top of me, and began clawing hold of my windpipe.
I felt my ears beginning to sing; but then he gave a
gurgle and a squirm, and his fingers loosened, and as I
crawled out I saw Martin trying to pull his bayonet out
of him, holding him down with his foot whilst he tugged
at the rifle.  Before he could get it out, a huge fellow
sprang at him with his rifle clubbed.  I sang out, and
he just managed to turn his head in time, but got an awful
blow on his shoulder which knocked him over.  The man
jumped at him again, but one of the other three marines
was on him in a moment, struck at him with his bayonet,
and caught him just under the armpit.  There was a frightful
yell and he fell, and I seized his rifle, pointed it at the
crowd, and pulled the trigger.  Nothing happened.  Hardly
knowing what I did, I shot the bolt backwards and
forwards and pulled again.  The magazine must have been
loaded, for it went off then and hit a brute who was
running at me, somewhere in the leg.  I know that it hit
him there, because he stumbled, and sat holding on to
it, and I quite well remember thinking that it served him
jolly well right.  The other three marines were close to
me, and Martin scrambled to his feet, trying to twist his
bayonet off his rifle to use as a dagger, because one arm
was useless.  The others were jabbing with their bayonets,
springing out, thrusting, and springing back again, and
parrying and trying to keep a circle clear.  One of them
(Tuck) threw up his arms and fell face downwards.  I
saw his fingers dig into the earth.  Then something struck
me on the left arm, just as if it had been struck by a
wooden hammer, and the Chinaman's rifle fell out of my
hands.  I stooped down to pick it up, but couldn't—I
remember that perfectly.</p>
</section>
<section>
<empty-line/>
<p>*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p>I don't remember anything more till I woke with a
splitting headache, feeling as if I wanted to be sick and
couldn't be.  It was almost dark.  I thought that I'd
had a nightmare—I often did, after too much gunroom
tinned salmon—and wondered why the lanterns had gone
out.  You know how you often wake up and think that
you are in some strange place, and gradually work things
out till they come right again.</p>
<p>That's what I tried to do, but I couldn't fix things, and
one eye didn't seem to work, and I wondered why I had
my boots and my uniform on, and why it was all so wet.
I put out my arm to feel if Jim's hammock was in its
place, and then I let out a yell and rolled back pretty
quickly.</p>
<p>That yell seemed to blow away the cobwebs, and I lay
back and began to make out that I was lying on a funny
kind of floor, in a small room with whitewashed walls
and a broken-down roof, with straw hanging through the
cracks.  The walls seemed to be made of bricks and mud,
and one had a door in it and a small square opening above
it, through which a little light came.  Someone close to
me began to move, and then sat up, very slowly.  It was
Martin, the gunroom "flat" sentry, and then I remembered
that he had saved me from being choked, and all
the things that had happened came back to me all at once.</p>
<p>"Where are we?" I asked.</p>
<p>He gave me a startled look.  "Crickey, sir, beggin'
your pardon, you does look a awful sight!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?  What's happened?"  I felt that
it was awkward to talk, my lips felt uncomfortable, and
I put my hand up to my face and it felt all raw and
swollen.  I couldn't see at all if I shut my right eye, so
knew that my left one was closed up.</p>
<p>"Kicked you in the face, sir, and dragged you away
afore we could stop 'em."</p>
<p>"What!" I said, very alarmed.  "The Commander not
here?  Where am I?"</p>
<p>"I don't exactly know where we be, sir, but them pirate
chaps 'ave got 'old of us, and Old Tinker Bill too; 'e was
brought in 'ere after us."</p>
<p>Then I saw that there was a bluejacket lying asleep
on the other side of him, and he dug him in the
ribs—"'Ere, wake up, Tinker!" and he sat up growling.</p>
<p>I saw that it was Miller, one of the armourers, and I
remembered that he had gone with Mr. Whitmore's party,
and I forgot all about worrying about where we were for
a second.</p>
<p>"Did we smash that gun?" I cried, and tried to sit up
in my excitement, but fell back again pretty quickly—my
left arm was so painful every time I tried to move.</p>
<p>Miller yawned and shook his head dolefully: "We never
got nowhere near it, sir.  Jerusalem!" he gasped, "you
do look a fair 'knock-out', sir, that you does."</p>
<p>"Well, tell me.  What happened?  Did Mr. Rawlings
get hurt?"</p>
<p>Then he told me that Mr. Hoffman had guided them all
right, but they made a goodish deal of noise themselves,
and our party (the Commander's party) had given the
alarm too soon, and they simply found themselves
running into hundreds of Chinese, and had to fall back
again.</p>
<p>"You see, sir, it was like this.  We went along all
right till those huts began a burnin', but the light from
'em just gave the show away, and let 'em see where to
fire.  Mr. Rawlings was knocked over, an' a lot more,
sir, an' the last as I seed of 'em was going back, very
slow, a-carryin' some people, an' stoppin' and firin'
back—occasional."</p>
<p>And all the time we had thought how jolly comforting
those flames were, and that they might help them to find
their way back.  I tried to get more from him about
Jim, but he didn't know any more, except that there had
been a lot of firing, and he had seen him fall, and two
men lift him up.  But that was enough to make me feel
frightfully sad, though I didn't really seem to imagine
that it was all quite real; and the pain in my head was
so bad, and my arm was so painful, and I was so stiff
and cold and cramped all over, that nothing could make
me much more miserable, not even knowing that we had
been captured by the pirates, or Jim had been badly
wounded.</p>
<p>"I fell into a ditch or something," Miller went on, "an
lost my way and got be'ind'and, and tried a-takin' a short
cut, and something 'it me on the head and fair dazed me,
and them ugly devils came up and collared me—came up
from be'ind, they did.  I never got a chance.</p>
<p>"I've got a bit of a scratch 'ere, sir," and he crawled
over to me, and stooped to show me a groove across the
top of his head.  A bullet must have done it, and the hair
was all matted together with blood.</p>
<p>"How did they catch you?" I asked Martin.</p>
<p>"Well, it was like this, sir.  I saw 'em a-picking of you
up—that not being so difficult, beggin' your pardon—and,
not thinking, I slipped along arter you, forgettin' that I'd
only got one arm that 'ud work.  Well, sir, I got
separated from them two others, and had 'em 'eathens all
round me, and they got the best of it, sir."  He was very
gloomy, and lifted his left arm a little way from his side.
"Ain't no good, sir!  Somethink's broke in my shoulder."</p>
<p>Miller had found a bowl full of water, and that made me
remember how thirsty I was, and he knelt down and gave
me some too, holding my head up.  It was jolly difficult to
drink, my lips were so swollen, and a good deal of it ran
down my neck, but it was jolly refreshing.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with my arm?" I asked him.  "I
think it's broken."</p>
<p>He took hold of it very gingerly, whilst I held on to the
wrist and jammed my teeth together, and then I saw by
the funny way the sleeve bent up halfway above the elbow
that it must be broken.  I felt the broken ends grate
together when he tried to move it.  Oh! it was so painful.</p>
<p>He knew something about bandaging and splints, and
tore down some of the thin rafters and lashed them on each
side of it with his black silk handkerchief, and that made
it more comfortable, and I managed to get on my feet.
I felt an awful wreck, and was as weak as a mouse.</p>
<p>We were all plastered with mud and green slime, and
were wet and horrid.  I had lost one of my gaiters and
my cap, and my revolver, lanyard, and cartridge belt were
gone; but I didn't really worry, because I felt too ill, and my
head throbbed so much that I had to lie down again, and it
was impossible to think properly, because everything was
going round and round inside it.</p>
<p>There was a noise on the outside of that door, and it
opened very slowly, whilst we all stared at it, and a
Chinaman put his head very slowly in, looked at us, saw me
turn to look at him, drew it back again, and shut the door.
I suppose he must have heard us talking.  I think that
I must have gone to sleep after this, because the next I
remember was a tall, gloomy-looking man standing over
me.  "You're an officer, aren't you?" he asked me, and I
told him that I was a midshipman.</p>
<p>"Come down with me," he said, and helped me to my
feet, and supported me down a spiral wooden staircase.</p>
<p>He got me into a room below, which was fitted up with
European furniture—a writing-table, some cane easy chairs,
and a camp bed.  He made me sit down, and began pacing
up and down the room.  There was a clock on the table, and
I saw that it was nearly midday.  He went on pacing backwards
and forwards, and I wondered whether he was the
Englishman who had stolen Mr. Hoffman's yacht.  I
hadn't the least idea what was going to happen.  Then
he took down a shaving glass and held it in front of me.</p>
<p>My aunt!  I was a sight, if you like.  All the left side
of my forehead and face was black and blue, and my left
eye was quite shut up, and my upper lip was tremendously
swollen and cut.  No wonder that Miller and Martin had
been surprised when they saw me.</p>
<p>He smiled grimly, put the glass down, and just then a
Chinese servant came in and spoke to him.</p>
<p>"I have some food ready for you; come and take some,
it will do you good," he said, and led me into the next
room, where there was a big bowl of hot soup.  The sight
of it made me feel ill; but I swallowed a little, and found
that it was doing me good, and managed to get through it
all.  It was jolly painful to put the spoon in my mouth.</p>
<p>He told me that he had sent some food up to Martin and
Miller, and that an old native who "doctored" for him
was coming soon.</p>
<p>He seemed strangely worried, and couldn't sit still.  I
should think that quite a dozen Chinamen must have come
in whilst I was getting through that soup and soaking
bread in it.  They all seemed very excited when they saw
me.  Most of them scowled at me.  Several of them were
plump, prosperous-looking men, jolly well dressed, but
others looked more like soldiers or sailors, great bony,
leather-skinned, fierce-looking fellows.  He seemed to have
trouble with them, and once or twice spoke very angrily.
I noticed, too, that whenever any of them came in, he put
his hand to his pocket.  I think, from the bulge, that he
had a revolver there.</p>
<p>He didn't look in the least fierce, except when he was
angry—not at all like a man who could have done all those
wicked things—and I began wondering whether he could
really be the man everyone had been cursing.  I suddenly
thought of Mr. Travers, and blurted out, "We've got
Mr. Travers back—that lieutenant you caught"—and, like
the conceited ass I am, said, "I found him."</p>
<p>"I know," he said bitterly; "I never wanted to take
him along; it was either killing him or taking him prisoner,
just as it was with you and those two men.  He fought like
a demon, simply threw himself on us, and had a revolver,
too.  I had to knock him on the head and take him along.
You'd better not let those people you've just seen know
that you were the one who found him.  They've vowed to
torture every one of those junks' crews who fall into their
hands."</p>
<p>I wished then that I hadn't spoken.</p>
<p>He began working himself into a passion, and his face
did look wicked.  He was tall and lean and very good
looking, and he clenched his fists, and jerked his arms
about, and began cursing everyone—Captain Lester, the
Admiral, Mr. Hoffman, himself, and Mr. Hobbs.</p>
<p>"How are they?  How's Sally?" I asked; but he didn't
seem to hear the first time, and raved about his cursed
bad luck.  Presently I asked again.</p>
<p>"I wish to heavens I'd never set eyes on either of them."</p>
<p>"Why don't you send them back to us?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Send 'em back?  I daren't; my life isn't worth an
hour's purchase now, and they'd never let me.  They'd
kill them first, and me too.  I don't run this show—not
really; it's run by some of those Chinese mandarins—two
or three of those who've just been in here.  They think
that as long as Hobbs and his daughter are in their hands
they can get theer ransom, and that your old fool bull dog
of a Skipper don't dare touch them.  They want me to
marry the girl—to make it more certain."</p>
<p>"We thought that you were trying to marry her," I said
stupidly.</p>
<p>"That's nothing to do with it—nothing to do with you,"
he jerked out very fiercely.</p>
<p>"If your fool Captain will run his head up against us, I
shall have to marry her to save her life and mine too."</p>
<p>"That's what those fat, oily-looking beasts want to do,
and want me to do; and those other bloodthirsty rascals
want to cut their throats and have done with them, say
they've only brought us trouble, and wish to get back to
their old established pirate business," he added, sneering.</p>
<p>"I've got them in the only strong walled house in the
town, and I've got a hundred of my best men to guard
them, but I can't trust 'em."</p>
<p>"If I'm caught I hang," he began shouting—I really
thought that he'd forgotten me—"and if she knows that it
will save my life, I believe she will marry me.  If things go
wrong I go, and directly I go, you all go—Hobbs and all of
you, and the poor girl too" (he clenched his hands across
his forehead).  "We've the scum of the Yangste here.
They'd cut my throat for a cent if I left off being useful to
them, and they'll cut all your throats for pure devilment."</p>
<p>He sank down on a chair and stared in front of him.</p>
<p>I had dropped my spoon and was very frightened.</p>
<p>A man came running in with a letter, talking very fast.
He gave a horrid smile when he had read it.  "It's from
your fool Captain.  Wants to know whether you're alive,
and says if any harm comes to you, he'll do I don't know
what."</p>
<p>"Go back upstairs and don't move till I tell you;" and
he sat down at the writing-table.</p>
<p>"Please tell the Captain that I'm well, all but my arm,
and that it was my fault that I was captured, not the
Commander's," I asked him, because I had been worrying
about that all the time, and knew that the Commander
must have had an awful time with Captain Lester, and that
that would be unfair.  I knew jolly well that I'd made an
ass of myself, and made things worse and more difficult for
everyone by getting myself and Martin taken prisoners.</p>
<p>He nodded grimly.</p>
<p>"Do tell me whether they all got away safely last night?"
I blurted out.</p>
<p>"They left one marine dead, no one else."  He began
to work himself into a passion again.  "My men almost
got out of hand last night—I'd a hard job to keep them
back—and if that old fool of yours lands again I shall lose
all control over them.  He won't believe what I wrote to
him, so I'm going to write it stronger this time.  If he comes
lumbering along here they'll all see 'red', and kill every
white man they can get hold of—and woman."  Then he
suddenly came across and gripped my shoulder.  "A
thousand years ago—eight hundred years ago—a girl
wouldn't marry a man unless he did something to win
her—sacked a town and carried her off.  Now they want
flowers, and chocolates, and candies, and pretty
speeches—ugh!"</p>
<p>Then he grew calmer.</p>
<p>"Go along up now—Ford your name is, I see—and wait
till dusk.  I'll try and get you all over to that walled house.
It's your only chance."</p>
<p>I was just going, when he called out, "In case anything
happens, you had better take this," and he opened a drawer
and pulled out a revolver and a couple of packets of
ammunition.  "They say it's easier to die fighting," and
he turned his back on me.</p>
<p>Feeling very frightened, and not quite understanding
what he'd been talking about, I crawled upstairs, the
Chinaman outside the door scowled at me, opened it
and shut it after me, and I heard him swing the big
wooden bar into its hole.</p>
<p>Martin and Miller were asleep—they evidently had had
a jolly good meal—and presently a funny, jovial, fat old
Chinaman came along and looked at my arm.  He took
my coat off and cut the sleeve of my flannel shirt, and the
arm was a most horrid sight, absolutely all mottled purple
from the elbow to the shoulder.  He showed me two tiny
holes, made a "poof" noise with his lips, darted his finger
as if it was a bullet, and nodded at me kindly.  Then I knew
that it was a bullet that had broken the bone.  He put on
cotton wool and proper splints and proper bandages, and
slung the arm up to my side and across my chest,
under my shirt, and helped me on with my monkey jacket,
and sewed my sleeve to the side.  Really the old chap
made me very comfortable.</p>
<p>He woke the others too, and did Martin's arm—the collar
bone was broken—and cleaned Miller's head, and then
went away, apparently quite honoured at being able to
show his skill.  I quite loved the old chap, and he made
me so comfortable that I lay down, and when my head was
quite still it did not throb so much, and I got in a jolly
good sleep.</p>
<p>I woke and found the room quite dark, and Miller and
Martin both snoring.  My head was quite clear now, and I
felt much stronger, groped about, and managed to get hold
of that bowl of water, drank a little, and then propped
myself up against the wall and wondered when that
Englishman was going to take us away to Mr. Hobbs and
Sally.  It was so exciting to think that I should see them
soon, that I really forgot that we were prisoners for some
time; but then, after waiting and waiting, and hearing
nothing except those snores, I began to feel frightened and
miserable.  I could think now without my head burning
inside, and then I thought how I had muddled up all
Captain Lester's plans, and "washed out" all that I had
done for him.  If I had only been man enough not to have
minded Captain Marshall's chaff, I shouldn't be here, with
my arm broken and a prisoner, and with Martin too; and I
was so wretched, that I wished that I had been killed
instead of Tuck, that marine whom I had seen fall and dig his
nails into the ground.  After all I had been longing to do,
it had simply come to this, and I snivelled a little, in the
dark, for there seemed to be nothing more worth living for.</p>
<p>Presently there was a loud boom a long way off, and
almost directly afterwards, the sound of a very big shell
bursting.  That wasn't very near either, but I knew jolly
well that nothing could make that noise except one of
the <emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis> eight-inch guns, and I could feel my head
throbbing inside again with excitement, and wondered
what was happening.  Then more came, and other smaller
ones, from quite a different direction.  I had seen an
opening in the wall—you couldn't call it a window—just outside
the door, and I thought that perhaps the Chinaman would
let me look out; so I groped round until I felt the door,
and rapped on it with my knuckles.  They didn't make
much noise, and I kicked it with my feet, and then
listened to hear if anyone moved; but there wasn't a
sound.</p>
<p>I tried to shake the door, and it seemed to "give"
towards me, and then to stick in the frame—I felt certain
that the wooden beam was not in place—but I couldn't
make it budge any more.  I woke Miller, and he came
across and got his fingers in a crack and pulled, and
the door creaked and opened, almost knocking me down.
We peered through the darkness and listened, and
presently I could hear a clock ticking—it was that old clock
I had seen in the Englishman's room.</p>
<p>"I'm going down," I whispered to Miller.  "Help me
off with my boots."</p>
<p>I got them off, felt that the revolver was still in my
pocket, and began creeping down that spiral staircase,
keeping to the outside and feeling the wall with my
one hand.  Every step creaked most horribly, and I
waited, trembling, each time, but nothing happened,
and then I had turned the corner and saw the bottom,
and that some lamplight was coming out of that room.</p>
<p>"Are you all right, sir?" I heard Miller whisper; and
I whispered back and felt braver, and got out the
revolver and crept down.  I couldn't hear the clock,
because my heart was beating so horridly, but I got down
to the door and looked in.  There was a lamp burning
on the writing-table, but not a soul there, and I went
through, very softly, into the room where I had had
that soup, and there was another lamp burning there,
and any amount of food on the table.  It looked as if
someone had only just finished a meal—a book and a
fork were lying on the floor, and the chair had been
upset.</p>
<p>There was a dark place beyond, with a flickering light
in it, as if a fire was burning; but I wasn't plucky enough
to go in there, ran back to the foot of the stairs, and could
just see Miller's scared face looking down.  I beckoned to
him to come down, and he did so, making an awful noise,
and Martin came too.  They got hold of one of the lamps,
and I didn't mind going into the kitchen place then.  It
was quite empty; there was no one there.  A funny-looking
kettle hung over a small wooden fire, on a big flat
stone, and was singing very quietly, and there was a
saucepan full of cooked potatoes.  They were quite warm,
and I seized one and began to eat it.  It was jolly good.</p>
<p>Miller and Martin were so hungry, that they forgot
everything else, and ran back to the table and began
"wolfing" food.</p>
<p>I had never thought of escape till now; but it flashed
across me that perhaps we could get away, and I went
back to the foot of the stairs and followed a long passage,
towards where I felt some cold air, and suddenly came to
an open door, and put my head out.</p>
<p>You know what happens when you open the door of
a rabbit hutch, and the rabbits come and pop their heads
out, and swizzle their noses and blink their eyes, and look
as if they didn't believe it, and run back again?  Well,
that was exactly how I felt and what I did.  I ran back to
Martin and Miller and told them, and they left off eating
and came along with me, and we all three looked out.</p>
<p>It was quite dark, except for some stars overhead, and
it seemed to be a small courtyard.  We stepped out very
gingerly—I had my revolver in my hand again—and
we searched round, and found a high wall all round,
and a very big door all studded with iron bolt heads,
and with several thick beams across it.</p>
<p>We couldn't hear any noise near us, but there was
a funny murmuring, buzzing sound some way off, and
just like the sound of the mob at Tinghai that night of
the fire, and far away we could hear big guns, and
shells bursting.</p>
<p>"That's our old eight-inch, sir," Miller whispered, as
one especially loud report shook the door.  "I expects
the old man—beggin' your pardon, sir, Captain Lester—is
coming along to look for us."  The smaller noises,
right in the other direction, he said was probably the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Oh-my-eye</emphasis> on the other side of the
island (the bluejackets called the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> the <emphasis>Oh-my-eye</emphasis>).
We couldn't really quite understand why they
were firing, but it was jolly comforting for all that.</p>
<p>I wondered what had become of the Englishman and
the Chinaman who had been guarding us, and the servant,
and wished he would come back to take us to that house
on the hill.  Now that I had a revolver, I thought that
I might still be some use in defending Sally, if once I got
there.</p>
<p>I slipped back into the house to see if perhaps he
was lying down on the bed and I hadn't noticed him,
but he wasn't.  The clock showed a quarter past eight,
and I knew that it must have been dark for more than
an hour, and felt frightened.  The noise of the mob
seemed to be getting louder and nearer too, and I
ran back to Miller and Martin, who were still near the
gateway.</p>
<p>Just as I got to them we heard some feet pattering
along the street outside, and then more and more, and
they stopped outside it and began pressing against the
gateway, and then began banging at it with something
hard.</p>
<p>The bangs seemed to go right through me.  I was
awfully frightened.</p>
<p>More people came rushing along; there was a fearful
din outside; we heard something scrape against the
wall, and someone scrambling up.  I looked up and
saw a man's head just above me.  He was crawling
over the top, and was just getting his legs over.  I
let my revolver off and he dropped back again, though
I don't think he was hit, and the crowd began yelling
like mad.</p>
<p>A rifle went off, the door splintered, and something
flew past me.  Martin pulled me to one side.  "Keep
out of the way, sir;" and the two of them hunted round
for some piece of wood or other, and came back with
some thick sticks.  Stones began dropping over, and
we crouched under the wall to dodge them.  They came
in hundreds all over the courtyard, and knocking up
against the house.  There was a terrific crash against
the great gates, and they sounded as if they were giving
way.</p>
<p>"We'll be scuppered, sir," Martin groaned.</p>
<p>"Run for the house," I whispered; and we rushed back.
One stone nearly hit me, and I heard a thud and Miller
cursing; but we all got inside and slammed the door, and
fumbled about to find the bolts.</p>
<p>"Go and get a lamp, sir," Miller shouted hoarsely—Martin
was too frightened to do anything except get
in our way—and I darted off.</p>
<p>As I ran along the passage I heard my name shouted,
"Mr. Ford, Mr. Ford!  Where are you?" and a short,
grey-bearded European came rushing out of the kitchen
place.  I thought at first that it was the Englishman,
but it wasn't.</p>
<p>"Show us how to bar the door," I cried, and he came
running with me.</p>
<p>"Quick, mon, quick!  Bar it up—that way; there's
the lock—not that way," and he shoved Miller aside
and shot the bolts in.</p>
<p>I was too frightened to ask him who he was, and even
to remember that I hadn't any boots; but Miller sprang up
the stairs and brought them down.  The man, whoever he
was, wouldn't let me put them on, so Miller tied the laces
together and hung them over my neck.</p>
<p>"Follow me!" the Scotchman yelled impatiently—I
knew he was Scotch by his accent—and we ran through
the sitting-room to the kitchen, and then we crept through
a narrow door.  He disappeared into the house, but came
back, and I saw him shove a big key into his pocket.</p>
<p>"Be varry careful," he whispered, and we groped our
way down some irregular stone steps.  We could hear
them still banging away at the courtyard door.  I kept
on bruising my feet and toes in the cracks, and
stumbling, but the old Scotchman always seemed to keep
me from falling; and at last we seemed to be at the
bottom, and near some water—I could hear it lapping
against the stones.  "Hush!" he whispered, and bent
down, stretched out his hand, got hold of a rope, began
hauling it in, and a native boat came sliding up, out of
the dark.</p>
<p>"Get in—quick!" he whispered, and we all stumbled
in, one after the other, and he jumped in after us.  Right
above us I could see two lighted windows, and knew they
were those two rooms, and as he shoved off we heard
a splintering sound—the big door had given way—and
heard the mob rushing across the courtyard, yelling in
the most fearful manner, and begin banging at the house
door.</p>
<p>I had hurt my arm again getting into the boat, and the
pain of it must have numbed me, because I quite well
remember that I wasn't so frightened then as I ought
to have been.</p>
<p>We could just see the strange man standing up in
the stern, swaying from side to side, and working a
scull as the boat wriggled through the water.</p>
<p>"It's aboot twa hours afore high water, and we've the
flood wi' us, the Lord be praised!" he whispered.  "Keep
down oot o' sight," and we tried to squirm down into
the bottom of the boat below the gunwales.</p>
<p>He stopped and stooped down, and we saw that he
was putting on some kind of a Chinaman's coat and a
native cap.</p>
<p>Then he went on again.</p>

<p>We went wriggling along through the dark, and presently
began to pass between junks—heaps of them.  You could
see nothing but their tall leaning masts sticking up like
slate pencils.  We dodged in and out, and sometimes a
voice would sing out from one of them, and we would
huddle down in the bottom of the boat, whilst the Scotchman
replied in what I suppose was Chinese, and pushed on.</p>
<p>We must have gone like this for nearly twenty minutes,
I should imagine, and then he stopped to take a breath.</p>
<p>"Who are you?  Where are you taking us?" I whispered;
but he didn't answer, and, changing his hands,
went on pushing the scull from side to side very
vigorously, but stopped a minute or two later and looked
behind us, where we could all at once see a great red
glow, which showed up the junks we had just passed.</p>
<p>"They've set a light to the boss's hoose," he whispered;
"they'll be after seeking the little lass the noo."  And he
worked harder and harder, and the shadows got darker
and the water more narrow, and I knew that we were
getting under some high land, and wondered whether
we really were being taken to that house on the hill.
Up over our heads we could hear a lot of talking and
wrangling, and suddenly a rifle went off, and then another,
and we could hear cries, and presently all was quiet
again.</p>
<p>My heart was simply thumping against my side.</p>
<p>"God grant we be in time," I heard him say to himself;
and he stopped sculling for a second, peered through the
darkness, and then shot the boat in till it rasped against
some stones.</p>
<p>"Get oot!" he whispered.  "Doan't talk a word, and
jest follow me."</p>
<p>We got ashore as quickly as we could.  He had a piece
of rope in his hand, and made us all take hold of it, and
we followed him along a steep path.  We hadn't gone
ten yards when there were more rifle shots and more yells.</p>
<p>"The Lord be praised! they're still shooting 'em," he
said, and hurried along all the faster.  I could hardly keep
up, and the stones hurt my feet.</p>
<p>We seemed to be making a long curve away from the
noises and the water, and he kept on losing the path, and
we had to shove our way between high bushes, which
scratched us; but then we turned to our right, and could
see the top of a high wall right in front of us.</p>
<p>He broke into a run, we dropped the rope, and ran after
him up to a small door.  He fumbled for a moment with
the lock, it opened, we crept in, and he shut it again.</p>
<p>We were in a garden place now, pitch dark, and he led
us across it underneath some trees with low branches.
The noise of rifles seemed to be right in front of us, and
we came to the walls of a house with not a light showing.
He knocked at a door; nothing happened.  We rushed
round to the other side to a smaller one; he tried his key
again, and it opened, and an old Chinese woman with a
tiny lamp in her hand, and her mouth open with fright,
was looking down at us.</p>
<p>The Scotchman turned to me.  "Go in there; Hobbs
and his lassie are there.  Get them here in two minutes;
I'll be back then.  We must get them away.  Quick,
for God's sake, boy!" and he disappeared.</p>
<p>I went in, and heard Sally's voice singing out—very
frightened and very sad, it seemed, "Who's that?  Is
it Captain Evans?"</p>
<p>"Midshipman Ford of the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>," I called out, not
knowing the least who Captain Evans was.  "We've
come to take you away."  My aunt!  I was proud then;
for it suddenly struck me that, after all, I should be able
to do something for Captain Lester.  Everything had
really seemed to work out right, and I expected Sally
to come tearing down, and was jolly glad that there
wasn't enough light for her to see me; but instead, I
heard a sob and then a fall, and guessed what had
happened.</p>
<p>The old woman brought her light, and I saw that she
was lying all in a heap.  I hadn't the least idea what
to do.  "What d'you do for a faint, Miller?" I asked.
"You've been through 'first aid'."  I was frightened
again, and didn't know what to do; but the old
Scotchman came rushing into the house, picked her up, took
her into another room, and shook her.  Miller had got
hold of some water and shoved it over her head, and
she tried to sit up.</p>
<p>"Where's Hobbs?  Where's your father?" he called
to her loudly; and she pointed through another door.
And we found the little man lying in bed, looking ghastly;
he looked an absolute skeleton.</p>
<p>He began to curse the Scotchman, but I stepped
between them.  "I'm Midshipman Ford of the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,
sir, come to fetch you and Miss Hobbs.  You must come
immediately; these are two of my men."</p>
<p>I must say that we didn't look very respectable, but we
were good enough for him, and he crawled out of bed and
began to dress.</p>
<p>"I'm too weak to walk much, but reckon I'll do it if
it ain't far.  You've been a tarnation long while finding
us," he grumbled.</p>
<p>I don't think that I liked him very much.</p>
<p>All this time the noise outside was awful—rifles firing,
crowds of people yelling—and stones began to patter
against the shutters.  The old Scotchman couldn't wait
any longer, wrapped the little man in a long Chinese
coat, lifted him off his feet, told Miller to bring Sally
along, and ran out of the house.  "So long as the boss's
people keep firing, it's all right," he told me; and then I
saw Miller lift Sally in his arms, in spite of her struggles,
and we all followed, stones flying past our heads and
rebounding from the walls.  We went across the garden
under those trees, and made our way back to that small
door.  The Scotchman put Mr. Hobbs on his feet, and
I heard him trying to get the key in the lock; but just
as he was going to open it, there was the sound of a
whole lot of people running towards it, and they threw
their shoulders against it and began talking very softly.</p>
<p>I was very frightened again, and I heard the Scotchman
moan: "Too late!  We're done for!" and we all
fled back to the house.</p>
<p>The front of it was now all lighted up with a red glare,
showing above the top of the wall.</p>
<p>"They're setting fire to the huts," he cried; "go up
to the top room.  Take them up there, bar the door at
the front, and block it up with tables—anything."  And
he rushed off, came back for his revolver, which he had
given to Martin, and disappeared.</p>
<p>"Guess Sally Hobbs ain't a ten-cent doll," I heard
her sob.  "You can put me down right away."  She
led us along some passages, up some steps, and then
to the foot of a ladder.  The little man got up it like
a monkey, and she followed him.</p>
<p>"Draw it up, and let it down when you hear us call,"
I sang out; and then we went back and began to pull
along tables and benches and boxes, everything we could
find, and piled them up behind the door in the front of
the house.  Before we had finished, the Scotchman came
running up with his hands over his head.  "We're fair
lost!  God be merciful to us!  The boss's men want to
know where he is, and won't hold out many more
minutes unless he turns up.  They want to open the
gates; say they'll get their throats cut if they don't.
Jorgensen has been killed—down in the town—two hours
ago—down by that six-inch gun."</p>
<p>"Can't you do anything?" I asked quickly.</p>
<p>"No, mon, they hate me; and I fear they've killed the
boss, and no one else can keep them in hand.  They're all
round us, and they've tasted blood, and the mandarins
themselves couldn't stop them.</p>
<p>"Hark!" he said, "they're beating down the little
door in the garden wall.  Oh, God, they'll be right here
in a moment!"</p>
<p>I was in an awful funk, though not for myself, I think,
but more because of Sally.  When one isn't in a funk for
oneself it is easier to keep one's head.  I don't think that
Miller or myself cared a scrap what happened to us, so
long as we could keep Sally safe.  The Scotchman told
us to bring any heavy things we could find to block up
the door at the back, and then ran off and brought some
rifles and bandoliers.</p>
<p>We bolted the door and piled everything we could find
against it, and then ran round, barring the shutters.  We
didn't need any lamp, because the red glare streamed
through the cracks and lighted up the whole place.  The
old woman had disappeared.  Then we picked up the
rifles and bandoliers, and he led us to the ladder, Sally
crying out and lowering it.  We all swarmed up and drew
it after us.</p>
<p>The room was a small square place, with stone walls
and narrow openings—you could hardly call them windows—in
each wall.  They were closed with iron shutters, and
the one looking over the front was open, and the whole
place was lighted up.  The Scotchman and I looked out,
and it was a most awesome sight.</p>
<p>Down below, about twenty yards from the foot of the
house, was the wall and the big gateway, and behind
it were the Englishman's men, stooping down to load
and then popping up and firing.  They seemed to be
standing on some kind of platform or ledge, and were
not taking the trouble to aim.</p>
<p>Out beyond there were flames pouring up from half a
dozen huts, and we could hardly hear their noise because
of the fearful shouts and yells from a dense crowd of
people in between us and them.</p>
<p>They must have seen our faces in the light of the fires,
for they yelled more loudly than ever, and we could see
them bending down and then throwing stones at us.
Stones began clattering against the outside wall all round
us, and one came flying into the room, and I heard Sally
sob with fright.  We drew in our heads and closed the
shutter, but before I drew in mine I am certain that
I saw one of the Chinamen inside the wall point his
rifle at us and fire.  The room was almost dark now,
except for one streak of light which came through a gap
at one edge of the shutter, and just made light enough for
us to see each other.  Mr. Hobbs was lying full length
on the floor near a wall, and Sally was lying down too,
with her head on his chest, and moaning.  I did wish
she would leave off, because it made us all so much more
frightened.</p>
<p>Directly we had closed the shutter, stones began clattering
against it—and, I'm certain, some bullets too—and we
heard a rush, and the mob charged the big gateway.</p>
<p>We could still hear the ships firing.  "My God, I wish
they'd come!" I heard Miller mutter; and that was what
I had been praying all the time.</p>
<p>The noise at the back of the garden seemed to have
stopped; but the firing from the wall was easing down
too, and the Scotchman groaned out, "They're going
to leave us;" and Sally, who seemed almost "off her
head", kept on moaning, "Why doesn't Captain Evans come?"</p>
<p>I felt that I should go mad in a minute if I didn't do
something.  Miller must have thought the same.  "It's
no use sitting 'ere to get killed, sir.  Can't we do
something?  Can't we fire at them?  We've got three
rifles."  But the Scotchman wouldn't let us open the shutter.</p>
<p>"Keep still, mon; they haven't all left us yet," and we
could still hear a few rifles firing from inside the wall.</p>
<p>Just for something to do, I began pulling on my boots—they
were still tied round my neck with the laces—and
it was awfully hard work with only one hand, and they
were all sodden and stiff; but Miller helped me.  We
had just finished, when suddenly there was a rush of feet
underneath us at the back of the house, and a furious
battering noise on the shutters.</p>
<p>"They've broken in!" the Scotchman groaned, and
Sally shrieked and buried her head in her lap.  Miller
seized a rifle and jumped across, pushed her out of the
way, opened the shutter at the back, and leant out.  I
saw him load it, and he was just going to fire, when there
were cries of "Sally!  Sally!  Open the door!" and more
hammering.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>
"HE WAS JUST GOING TO FIRE"</p>
<p>
<emphasis>"HE WAS JUST GOING TO FIRE"</emphasis></p>
<p>We jumped to our feet.  Sally shrieked that it was
Captain Evans come to save her, Miller roared "Who's
there?" and we heard someone sing out, "Who are you?
Is Sally safe?"</p>
<p>I knew the voice; it was Mr. Ching's, the Lieutenant on
board the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.  I forgot all about my arm, and
jumped over to where Miller was.  "Get out of the way!"
I cried, and yelled down, "Midshipman Ford of the
<emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>.  There are six of us up here, and Miss Hobbs
is all right."</p>
<p>"Come down and let me in."</p>
<p>"Right you are, sir!" I shouted, and drew in my head.</p>
<p>"Isn't it Captain Evans?" Sally asked me.</p>
<p>"No.  Mr. Ching of the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>"</p>
<p>She moaned and began crying again.</p>
<p>We lowered the ladder and scrambled down, pulled the
things away from the door at the back, and opened it, and
there was Mr. Ching and twenty or thirty of his men, all
crowding round.</p>
<p>I could only say, "Thank you very much, sir," and
should have blubbed if I'd tried to say any more.</p>
<p>"Hoffman brought us, showed us a path up from the
water.  He's gone to try and keep order.  Can she come
away at once?"</p>
<p>I don't know what I was going to say.  It didn't make
any difference, because the noise at the other side of the
house suddenly grew fearfully loud, and we heard the
gates give way and swing back with a crash, and the
mob rush through with frightful yells of triumph.
Mr. Ching gave an order, and ran round to the front of the
house, and I found myself following him with Miller
behind me.</p>
<p>Some more men joined him at the corner, and then we
came out into the glare and saw the bright gap in the
dark wall made by the gates being open, and a mob
sweeping up to the house.  They had torches and blazing
tufts of straw on poles.  A few of the Chinamen inside
the wall were trying to keep them back, but I could see
most of them dropping over the wall outside.</p>
<p>Mr. Ching's people fired a volley into the mob, and then
another, and some shots came from the room I'd just
left—the Scotchman and Martin firing, I expect.</p>
<p>The mob didn't seem to have expected any resistance,
and stopped and left off shouting.  I could see many of
them throw their hands up and fall, and there were shrieks
and screams, the blazing bits of straw fell on the ground
and were trampled out, and they began to fly back through
the gateway.</p>
<p>I was swept along with Mr. Ching's men, and found
myself in the gateway.  Some of them were swinging
back one side of it, and pulling aside bodies which were
in the way.</p>
<p>Someone was trying to crawl away as the big gate
swung towards him.  It was Mr. Hoffman.  I could see
him well, and just managed to pull his legs clear as it
swung to.  He didn't recognize me.</p>
<p>"You hurt, sir?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Shot through the chest; get me into a corner.  Is
Sally safe?"</p>
<p>Miller was nowhere to be seen, and I couldn't make any
of the <emphasis>Huan Min's</emphasis> bluejackets understand.  They were
too excited.</p>
<p>"Try and get hold of me; get hold of my coat."</p>
<p>He grabbed at my left side; I gave a yell with the pain
of it.  "Not that side; the other, sir," and he got his
fingers into the slit of my other pocket and drew himself
on his knees, spitting blood out of his mouth and coughing.</p>
<p>Supporting himself like that, and with the other hand
on the ground, he managed to crawl back to the house
and then rolled on his back.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I'm Ford of the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>."</p>
<p>"Thank God you are safe!  I'm dying.  Bring Sally to
me;" and he coughed again.</p>
<p>"It's not safe for her here; I'll try and get you round to
the back."</p>
<p>I heard my name called, and ran towards the gate, and
there was Mr. Ching looking for me.  "Where is Hoffman?
Are you all ready to start?  We can keep them off
for a time," he panted.</p>
<p>I pointed to where Mr. Hoffman was lying.  "He's shot
through the chest.  He's dying.  He can't move."</p>
<p>Mr. Ching groaned.  "We shall have to stay here till
daylight.  I can never find my way back without him."</p>
<p>I forgot about the Scotchman.</p>
<p>The last of his bluejackets rushed back through the
gate, the other half were swung across, and we were in
darkness again, except for the glare over the top of the
wall.  Bullets were now spattering against the front of
the house, and bits of plaster were trickling down, and
we knew that the Chinamen from inside must have joined
the mob.  Mr. Ching rushed off to place his men round
the wall, and I went back to Mr. Hoffman.  He was trying
to pull himself up against the side of the house, and
I gave him my right shoulder to lean upon, and we got
round to the back like that and to the door; but he
couldn't drag himself over the boxes and piles of things
heaped there, and lay down with his head on the stone slab,
half in and half out of the door.</p>
<p>"Get me some water and bring Sally," he whispered.
"I'm finished.  God have mercy on me!"</p>
<p>I couldn't see his face—it was so dark—but his voice
sounded awful.</p>
<p>I was trembling all over, and scrambled in and called
out for Sally.  I forgot to call her Miss Hobbs.</p>
<p>She was still in that small room, and I heard her
crawling across the floor.  I heard the Scotchman and Martin
firing out of the window too.</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked in a scared voice.  "Are we
safe?  Has Captain Evans come?"</p>
<p>"Come down with me.  Mr. Hoffman's dying, and
wants to see you."</p>
<p>She wouldn't come for some time; and when she did
come she was trembling all over, and I had to steady her
with my right arm along the passage.</p>
<p>We found a tin with some water in it, and I took her to
Mr. Hoffman, where we could just see him lying.</p>
<p>"Thank God!" I heard him whisper, when she bent over him.</p>
<p>I went away, wanting to cry.</p>
<p>Then I suddenly remembered that the Scotchman could
guide us down to the water, and ran off to find Mr. Ching,
but couldn't.</p>
<p>Miller appeared from somewhere.</p>
<p>"That old Scotchman could guide us back," I said.
"Where's Mr. Ching?"</p>
<p>"That ain't no good, sir," he said.  "They're all round
us now, 'undreds and 'undreds of 'em, an' 'e's got only
fifty men with 'im."  Then I noticed that bullets were
coming from the back of the house as well, and heard
furious firing near the little gate by which we had entered.</p>
<p>"That Chinese Lootenant is over there now, sir."</p>
<p>I went across for him, but couldn't find him.  His people
were outside the little doorway, firing into the dark, and he
must have been there too, and I didn't dare to go out.  I
couldn't see a yard in front of me.</p>
<p>I think I must have been too absolutely "done up"
then to do anything more, and I really forget what I did
and what happened.  I know that I sat down on a stone
somewhere near that small doorway, and rested my head
on my knees, and squeezed my left arm to change the pain
of it.  I know that rifles were going oft all round me, and
people were shrieking and yelling, and sometimes I heard
Miller's voice shouting; but everything seemed to buzz
round in my head, and nothing seemed to matter in the
least.</p>
<p>I rather fancy that my idea was to wait there till
Mr. Ching came back, and tell him about the Scotchman.</p>
<p>I was roused by hearing the door slammed and being
nearly knocked over.  Mr. Ching saw me.  "Get along
back to the house," he gasped—his face was streaming
with blood—"I can't hold the walls any longer.  I have
not enough men;" and he more or less lifted me to my
feet and gave me a push, and I went staggering along
with my legs giving way under me.</p>
<p>I remember seeing Mr. Hoffman lying flat on his back,
with his face turned up and his eyes looking at me, and
remember speaking to him; but he didn't answer.  Sally
wasn't there either, and I stepped across him, and
somehow or other found myself stumbling up the ladder into
that room, and heard Sally sobbing in a corner.  I was
shivering, and my teeth were chattering, and that horrid
sick feeling came on again.</p>
<p>Just as I got to the bottom of the ladder a stream of fire
shot up across one of the windows, and I heard a rushing
noise, as if it were a rocket; but I didn't take any notice
of it, for everything seemed to be going round and round
People crowded up after me, and pushed me aside, and
began firing out of the windows, and the room felt stuffy
and full of powder smoke.  Sometimes someone would
give a cry, and once someone fell across my legs, and I
tried to pull them from under him, but couldn't, and let
them stop there, and remember that the weight was pulled
away presently, and I was pushed nearer the wall, and
someone gave me some water.</p>

<p>*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p>The next I remember was recognizing Miller's voice; it
sounded muffled and cotton-woolly and very far away.
He was saying: "The Chinese Lootenant wants to know
if you can take in Morse[#], sir.  The <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> is signalling.
We fired a rocket an hour ago to let 'em know that the
<emphasis>Huan Min's</emphasis> men were 'ere, an' we've been tryin' to take
in their signal."</p>
<p>[#] Morse code for signalling at night by means
of long and short flashes of a lamp.</p>
<p>"I can't take in flashing lamp," I told him, trying to
make my brain work.</p>
<p>"It ain't flashing lamp, sir; they're adoin' it with a
searchlight, and very very slow, sir, an' the Chinee
signalman what came along with 'im, sir, is dead, sir.  You'll
'ave to come along pretty quick too, sir; there's a 'orrid
fog been shuttin' everythin' out ever since, but it's just
cleared off for a time.  The wind's gone round to the
south, and it 'as been as thick as pea soup."</p>
<p>I told him that I would try, and got him to help me up.
I knew that I could read it if it was slow enough, and my
brain would only remember properly.  We had to go to
the other end of the house, and I don't know how Miller
got me down that ladder.  I know that I slipped and was
caught at the bottom, and my left arm was wrenched again.
The pain seemed to wake me up, but I had to grind my
teeth and sing out.</p>
<p>Miller helped me along the passage and made me stoop
down when we passed a window, because the shutters had
been thrown back and men were standing at them firing
out, and sometimes bullets were coming in.</p>
<p>"How are we getting on?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Pretty middlin', sir.  We've only had about three
killed and two or three wounded, and we can keep the
skunks out of it when we can see them, which we can't
always do on account of this 'ere blessed fog."</p>
<p>He helped me up some steps, and then up a short
ladder.  Someone hauled me out of a small square
opening, and I saw that there was nothing but fog all round
drifting slowly past.  I heard Mr. Ching's voice: "Can
you take in Morse?  I've forgotten it, and my signalman
is dead—shot half an hour ago;" and he pointed to a
huddled-up figure beside him.  "They've been trying to
signal through the fog ever since I fired that rocket,
and he got one or two words, but it's been too thick
till now.  They're just starting again."</p>
<p>I did my best to pull myself together, and asked him
where the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> was, and followed his finger, pointing
through the mist, and suddenly saw a very faint
searchlight beam sticking straight up.</p>
<p>"Don't stand up; kneel down," he whispered.  "They
are firing at us."  So I knelt down very quickly.  Just
seeing that beam made me buck up, and I watched it very
steadily.  I had only just knelt down in time, for a bullet
came flying past, and made me crouch still lower.</p>
<p>Then the beam began to wag very slowly—long sweeps
down to the ground for "longs", and short ones only
half-way for "shorts".</p>
<p>"Get your knife and scratch 'longs' and 'shorts' on a
tile as I sing them out," I told Miller, and heard him
do it.</p>
<p>This is what I took in: "... rst ... tenant to Lieutenant
Ching (full stop).  Captain landed with one hundred
and fifty men two hours ago (full stop).  Afraid dense fog
has de——"  Then the beam disappeared as a thicker
bank of fog rolled across; but it was grand news, and I
wanted to cheer for joy, and kept my eye fixed on the
same spot, and presently the beam showed again, and I
spelt out: "rocket if Midshipman Ford, Armourer's Mate
Miller, Private of Marines Martin is with you."</p>
<p>"They want another rocket fired, sir," I told him.</p>
<p>"I haven't any more rockets," Mr. Ching said.  "We
only brought one; the others were left in the boats by
accident."</p>
<p>The beam started again.  "First Lieutenant to
Lieutenant Ching (full stop).  Captain has——"  They were
repeating the signal, but then the beam disappeared
entirely, and we could see a white wall of fog creeping along
the ground, and even swallowing up the trees underneath us.</p>
<p>"They ought to be here soon," Mr. Ching said, "if only
they can find their way."</p>
<p>He sent a man round with the news, and we could hear
his bluejackets making a funny cheering noise.</p>
<p>I felt ever so much better, and simply being able to take
in that signal, and be of a little use, cheered me up
wonderfully.  It was so grand to know that the Captain had
landed with so many men and was coming to our rescue.
I knew he would come just as quickly as he ever could,
and oh! I did so long to see him, whether he was angry
or not, and to tell him that it wasn't the Commander's
fault—not in the least, and to know that Sally and all
of us should be safe.</p>
<p>"Does Mr. Hoffman know?" I asked Miller.  Mr. Ching
had sent me down again, and had come down too,
see how his men were going on.</p>
<p>"He's been dead this last hour, sir."  He was dead
when we had to come back to the house, and we dragged
him in after us.</p>
<p>I did feel so sorry, because we should never have found
where Sally was but for him, and he had done so magnificently;
and I knew that the Captain would be so sorry too,
especially as Mr. Hoffman had beaten him at weight lifting.</p>
<p>"You go and get some more sleep," Mr. Ching told
me; but I felt so much better, that I implored him to
let me stay with him, and he did.</p>
<p>"We are doing all right, aren't we, sir?"</p>
<p>"So far; but this fog makes it difficult for us to see
them, and I fear they may try and rush us.  We have
not much ammunition left."</p>
<p>We went all round the house, and he spoke very
cheerfully to all his men.  They were at all the windows
with their rifles pointing out, and peering into the fog.
One or two men were wounded, and sitting with their
backs to the wall.</p>
<p>"I am going to tell the news to Hobbs and his
daughter," Mr. Ching said, when we had come to that
end of the house.  I had been going to ask him if I
could do this, but he said it so curtly, that I thought
he wanted to do it by himself, so didn't go with him.</p>
<p>"You have a lot of blood on your face, sir," I told
him.  "I hope you aren't hurt much."</p>
<p>"Only a stone," he said; but he wiped it off, till I
told him there was no more showing—he wiped it off
very carefully—and then went up the ladder.</p>
<p>Miller hadn't the faintest idea what time it was—somewhere
about midnight, he thought.  We were standing
near one of the open shutters, and could just see the
three or four bluejackets who were guarding it.
Outside there was simply a grey black wall of fog.  It had
settled down so thickly, that you couldn't see a yard
from the house, and was drifting in through the windows
all damp and beastly.  Everything was pitch dark; I
couldn't see the flames at all (as a matter of fact, the
huts had burnt themselves out, but I didn't know that);
and Miller told me that everything had been pretty
quiet during the last half-hour, nothing except an
occasional shot, and that the Scotchman and Martin were
still in the upper room.  "We had a stiffish bit of
business getting back to the house, sir.  There seemed
to be thousands of them on top of us, but they seem
to have cleared off—some of them—and I'm thinkin'
they may be after going for the Captain's party."</p>
<p>"Have you heard nothing of them—no firing or
anything like that?" I asked; and when he said "No",
asked him if he thought they would be able to find
their way to us.  He scratched his head and wouldn't
give an answer.</p>
<p>"It's lucky, sir, you picked up that bit of Morse, sir;
it's put new life into all of us."</p>
<p>I was so proud and conceited of myself, that I told him
to go and lie down, and that I would look after the lower
windows.</p>
<p>"No, I dars'n't, sir; they're keeping quiet now; but I'm
dreadin' they'll be tryin' to rush us.  I durs'n't, sir.  We've
only got about ten rounds a man left, and it may come to
bayonet work, sir, afore we get through the night."</p>
<p>There really wasn't a sound coming from outside, and it
all seemed so dark and moist and "creepy", that I really
had a most horrid feeling "inside".</p>
<p>Mr. Ching came down the ladder.  "She's asleep," he
said, and I knew that he was disappointed.  He began
going round the men at the windows, seeing that the
ammunition was distributed equally.  Some men had
only two or three rounds left, and I knew by the sound
of his voice that this worried him very much.</p>
<p>One of his men brought round a huge bowl of boiled
rice, and the bluejackets scooped it out with their hands
and stuffed it down.  They brought another one for
Mr. Ching, and he shared it with Miller and me and
the Scotchman and Martin.  It was jolly good and
jolly warming, and I have never forgotten it; and now,
whenever the messman has a lot of scraps left over,
and gives us curry in the gunroom, I think of it and
of trying to save the bits of rice that wouldn't go into
my mouth, and of that horrid fog.</p>
<p>Mr. Ching was talking of the possibility of getting
some ammunition by searching all the dead Chinamen
between the house and the wall, but then he remembered
that the bluejackets' rifles wouldn't take the pirates'
cartridges.  They were using Mauser, and his men had only
a very old pattern rifle.</p>
<p>"Why couldn't we bring in rifles too, sir?" I said.
"There must be heaps of them lying out there;" and
then, without thinking what I was going to do, I sang
out to Miller to give me a "leg up", and scrambled
through the window, and slid down on the ground
underneath.  Miller slipped down alongside me.</p>
<p>"Come back," I heard Mr. Ching say, but not very
determinedly, and I had such a lot of "leeway" to
make up for all the stupid things I had done, that I
would not have gone back for anybody.  You see, I
thought that I might do something useful, and also
I was rather ashamed that Mr. Ching and his men
should have done everything and we so little.</p>
<p>"Give me two bags," Miller whispered; and Mr. Ching
handed out two things like haversacks, and he
slung one over my shoulder and one over his.</p>
<p>"Tell your people, sir, that we've gone, in case they
think we're pirates, please;" and then we crept along
until we found the door in front of the house.</p>
<p>"Most of them are in the path to the gate," Miller
whispered, and we groped along it.</p>
<p>We hadn't gone five yards before my foot struck something
soft, and it was a body, and I felt it all over, but
couldn't feel any cartridges, and there was nothing either
on the ground all round.  I found several more without
ammunition, and then, presently, a couple by themselves,
with two rifles lying on the ground close by.  It was
ripping to feel their cold barrels, and the men had full
bandoliers round their waists.  I couldn't take them
off by myself, so whistled for Miller very softly, and
he came over to me.  He had found another rifle and
a good number of cartridges.</p>
<p>"Better take these back," he whispered; and we did,
groping our way through the fog, and handed them in
at a window.</p>
<p>I knew that there ought to be a good many on that
ledge under the wall, where I had seen the Chinamen
standing to fire over it, and told Miller.</p>
<p>"Right you are, sir!  Let's try;" and we shoved off
into the fog again.</p>
<p>"Is that gateway still closed?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Been smashed over an hour, an' they've been swarming
all over 'ere, up to 'arf an 'our ago, sir, just where we
are now, sir."</p>
<p>Phew!  I'd never thought that the pirates had been
right inside the wall again, and I'm certain that I never
should have come if I had—I'm positive about that.</p>
<p>I was fearfully nervous, and I think Miller was too, and
we stopped and listened, and tried to peer through the fog.</p>
<p>We couldn't hear a single thing, and started out again.
Then I ran into a tree, and the wet leaves and twigs
scratched across the raw part of my face, and I let out
a little "yelp", and we stopped to listen once more.</p>
<p>"We're too much to the right, sir," Miller whispered,
and we both kept close together and moved towards the left.</p>
<p>We came on the wall all of a sudden, and felt that
ledge.  There still wasn't the least sound of anyone moving.</p>
<p>"You go that way, sir, and I'll go the other," Miller
whispered, and left me, and I felt my way along towards
where I thought the gateway must be.  I felt any number
of empty cartridge cases, and every now and again my
fingers clutched a loaded one, and I slipped it into the
bag; and I felt a rifle and was awfully pleased, and
slung it round my neck—it was jolly difficult to do it
with only one hand, and jolly uncomfortable too.
Presently my foot hit up against some big wooden thing,
and I knelt down and felt it, and thought it must be
a part of the gateway, and that I must be right in the
opening.  That made me frightened, and I crept across
and bumped into the other side of the door; it was
simply swung back.  I had kicked another rifle, but
hadn't the pluck to go back and fetch it.</p>
<p>I just held on, trembling all over, and waited and
listened, and then started again, following the door
round till I got to the wall, and there, the first thing
I felt, was a box on the ledge, right in the corner
between the door and the wall.  I felt it all over; it
had a square hole in the top, and my hand went in
and—oh! it was such a jolly feeling—it was nearly full
of paper packets of ammunition.</p>
<p>It was too heavy to lift with my one hand, so I began
to whistle very softly for Miller, and waited for him to
come.  I heard his whistle, but almost at the same
moment I heard someone moving on the outside of the
wall.  I knew that it couldn't be Miller, and I do really
believe that my hair stood on end with absolute funk.
I couldn't have whistled again if I'd tried, and could
not have run back to the house, however much I wanted
to, because my feet wouldn't—absolutely wouldn't—move
an inch.</p>
<p>There were more than one coming.  There seemed to
be a long string of them, and there was a funny rustling
sound against the wall, as if they were carrying something
soft, and they began coming round the doorway, some of
them stepping on that rifle that I had kicked, but not
picked up.  The gate door was pushed back on me, and I
squeezed myself into the corner against the ammunition
box, and they began running past me, going along inside
the wall—away from where Miller was.  I could hear them
breathing hard, and held my breath, till I thought I should
burst, and thought they must hear my heart thumping—it
was thumping away like anything.  I'm not at all big, and
I huddled down so close, that they went by without finding
me, though once or twice something brushed my face, and
knew by the touch and the smell of it that it was straw
or hay, and that that was what had made that rustling
sound.</p>
<p>I guessed directly what they were going to try to do—pile
it up against the house and set fire to it.</p>
<p>I waited till the last one had gone, and then I managed
to get to my feet, and heard Miller's whistle, very close, on
the other side of that door, and that started my legs
working, and I ran, stumbling, back to the house, with Miller
after me.  We bumped up against it; I don't remember
getting inside, but only remember telling Mr. Ching
everything, and that the Chinese seemed to be following the
wall in order to get to the back of the house.</p>
<p>"The left side of the gate door doesn't seem to be
damaged, sir," I told him; "they swung it back on me."</p>
<p>He made up his mind in no time.  "They'll try and
burn down the door at the back, there's no window from
which we can shoot them," and he gave Miller ten men to
go and close the left half of the gateway, whilst he took
another ten and slipped round to drive the Chinese across
to him.</p>
<p>He wouldn't let me go.</p>
<p>"Keep the rest of the men at the windows," he said,
and disappeared in the fog.  I ran round the windows to
see that the men were there properly, and then went and
stood behind the things piled behind the door at the back
and waited.</p>
<p>It seemed like twenty minutes—it probably was only
about one—and I was trembling with excitement, and when
a little piece of mortar or something fell down the wall, I
nearly yelled with fright.  Then I heard the rustling noise
again, and heard a bundle pushed against the bottom of
the door, and then another and another.  All of a sudden
Mr. Ching's voice shouted, and there were cheers and
shrieks, someone fell against the door with a soft noise,
and there was the noise of people scampering all over the
ground outside.  A volley sounded out from behind me—the
crash seemed to come through the windows—and more
shouting and yelling, and I couldn't think what that meant,
because the men with the straw couldn't possibly have got
round there by that time.</p>
<p>I ran round to one of the windows at the front, and
was just in time to prevent some of the bluejackets jumping
out.  We couldn't see anything, not even the flashes
of the rifles at the gate.  But the firing died down almost
at once, and then people began running past the house, and
we could hear them panting, and heavy blows and shrieks,
and knew that Mr. Ching's bluejackets were chasing them.
It was awfully weird, knowing all going on round us,
and not being able to see anything.</p>
<p>Some of the bluejackets were so excited, that they did
scramble out to join in the killing, and Martin and the
Scotchman called out, from the top of the ladder, to know
what was happening, and I heard Sally, very scared, asking
too.</p>
<p>The noises stopped, and we could hear our people calling
to one another; and we all shouted to let them know the
way, and they gradually began to come back, climbing
through the windows and panting for breath, several of
them wiping their sword bayonets.</p>
<p>"Did you kill them all?" I asked Mr. Ching.</p>
<p>"Most of them, I think.  You've done us a good turn—very
lucky that you saw them."</p>
<p>He had left half a dozen men at the gateway to give
him warning if they made another attempt, but Miller
himself came back and brought that box of ammunition
and two more rifles with him.</p>
<p>Mr. Ching was very pleased with these, because we now
had altogether eleven Mauser rifles and seven or eight
hundred cartridges.</p>
<p>It was grand, and I forgot all about the mistakes I had
made, and my arm, and only longed for the fog to clear
away and to see the Captain stalking through the
gateway, and Blucher—I knew that Blucher would be
there—smelling the bodies and wagging his tail and looking up
at him, thinking he had shot them.  It was splendid to
know that it was partly due to me that we had driven them
off, this last time, and that I had found all that ammunition.</p>
<p>"What were you firing at?" I asked Miller; and he told
me that a lot of Chinamen had tried to rush through the
gate—not the men with the straw bundles, but others from
outside.</p>
<p>"We gave 'em 'gip', sir."  He was very happy.</p>
<p>Mr. Ching told me afterwards that they had some tins of
paraffin to throw over the straw.  Wasn't it lucky that I
had spotted them?</p>
<p>Sally was awfully sweet to Mr. Ching, said that he had
saved her life twice, and was so nice that he ferreted
round and got her something hot—tea, I think.</p>
<p>The old American was still sticking to his corner; I
don't think that he had moved all the night.</p>
<p>After we had spoiled their little game they let us alone,
and all we had to do was to take it in turns to lie down
and sleep, and when we were on watch, to listen for any
sign of Captain Lester.</p>
<p>The ships hadn't fired since the fog had come on.  We
had wondered what they had been firing at all the time.</p>
<p>You can just imagine how we did long for daybreak, and
for that beastly fog to clear away.</p>
<p>A long time afterwards Miller came up to me; he was
very excited.</p>
<p>"Listen, sir!  Listen!  The Cap'en's a-comin'."</p>
<p>I jumped up; it was still pitch dark, and the fog just as
thick as ever, and then I heard far away the noise of
Maxims—tut-tut-tut-tut, tut-tut-tut-tut.</p>
<p>"Them's Mary and Jane, sir, right enough."  Those
were the names the men had given the two Maxims which
we used to drill on field-gun carriages.</p>
<p>"They've been firin' for the last twenty minutes, sir."</p>
<p>The Captain's coming at last.  Hurrah!  I couldn't help
giving a shout of joy, and ran off to tell Sally, but
Mr. Ching had told her a quarter of an hour ago.</p>
<p>"Guess I'm right tired," was all she said to me, and
began crying again.  I know she had something she
wanted to ask me, but didn't like to.</p>
<p>She didn't seem half as pleased as I thought she ought
to be; but that didn't worry me at all, and I went round
the men who were talking and chattering, and I grinned at
them in the dark, and I'm sure that they grinned back.  I
could have hugged them, they were such fine great fellows,
and Mr. Ching squeezed my arm—not the bad one—and
said, "We've saved Sally Hobbs all right, Ford."</p>
<p>I was absolutely happy, and felt jolly hungry at the
same time.</p>

<p>Fancy me writing a book, or rather, helping to write one.
I know a good lot of people will think the world's coming
to an end, or that I've turned over a new leaf, and am
becoming really a credit to the family.  It's about time I did
become a credit to them, poor things!  I should imagine.</p>
<p>When I was asked to drive the giddy nib, I laughed.
Laughed! why, I've never laughed so much since father
died, as a dear little girl from Massachusetts told me once,
when I tried to cheer her up, after that sad event had
happened to her family.</p>
<p>We tried to get old "B.-T."[#] to wield the flowing pen,
and tell of all his heroic deeds, but—well—he wasn't taking
any—thank you kindly—and they got me to take on the job.</p>
<p>[#] Lieutenant Gore-Travers, known as Bored-Travers, or "B.-T."</p>
<p>You see, whilst old Truscott, the Commander, was lying
on his downy couch with a bullet in him somewhere, he
couldn't be expected to know much of what happened
outside him, could he?  Old Mayhew, our boss doctor man,
wouldn't say where the bullet really was.  Why, bless your
soul, he wasn't going to give himself away, not he, and
hung round Truscott's cabin with a face as long as a jews'
harp whilst he was outside it, and as round and smiling as
a Dutch cheese with a slice out of it when he went in.</p>
<p>It was all because that silly young ass Ford saw "red"
that night we landed with my chaps to have a bit of a
plugging match, whilst Whitmore went off with a No. 9
detonator and something in the gun-cotton "line" to blow
a gun of sorts.</p>
<p>He thought that he was half-back in a "footer" scrum,
or something like that, charged the whole blooming pack
of Chinese, got "offside", and was collared and carried
off the ground before we could get the referee to sound
his whistle.</p>
<p>We argued it out with them for a while, but when old
Truscott was doubled up with a bullet in him (you'd better
ask Mayhew where), and two or three of my chaps had
had holes made in them, we had to drop back to the
battery, and couldn't even bring away Tuck, one of my
men who'd been killed.  They were so jolly anxious to make
our acquaintance, that it was all we could do to hold on
behind the wall, and the bank on the beach, till Whitmore
had said goodbye to his chums and got aboard the cutter.
Even then we couldn't have got away, if young Withers
in the barge hadn't dropped a few gentle hints with his
Maxim and emptied a couple of belts.</p>
<p>We pulled away back to Lawrence, who was waiting for
us in the steam pinnace, and I ought to have been standing
up in the stern sheets, waving my gory, glittering sword
over my head and singing, "With a long, long pull,
and a strong, strong pull, cheerly! lads! pull away", to
encourage the sailor men.  The only reason why I didn't,
was because in the last rush to the boat I'd got a clap
over the head which knocked me silly, had been plumped
down in the stern sheets, and didn't know anything about
it till we'd got aboard the old <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes to find myself in my own virtuous
bunk, daylight starting the flies skylarking, and Grainger,
my servant, the trusty, faithful and never-to-be-forgotten
one, poking me to see if I was still alive.  I had the
dickens of a headache, and at first thought it was due to
the usual cause; but Grainger held up the serge frock[#]
which I had worn the night before, and I remembered what
had happened.</p>
<p>[#] Serge frock is a tunic made of serge, worn on
undress occasions.</p>
<p>"That were your second best serge frock, sir," he said
sadly, when he had recovered from his surprise at finding
me alive.  "Cost you four pun', three-and-sixpence—with
postage, sir."</p>
<p>It was soaked with mud, and had a bullet hole through
one sleeve.  There was a dark patch of blood, too, just in
the centre of my manly bosom, which Grainger never could
wash out.  Whose blood it was I never knew, and old
Mayhew threw things at me when I afterwards asked him
if he could examine it, and see if it belonged to a
Chinaman whom I had opened up a little during the scrap.</p>
<p>"We 'aven't paid for it, 'ave we, sir?  We couldn't send
it back as a misfit or some'ow, I s'pose?  I knew you'd
being doing som'ut like that, sir, if I let you wear it, and
your third best pair of trouses is all split over one knee
another three-pun'-ten gone slosh, sir—that is, if they
won't take 'em back, and there's another of our
hye-glasses gone too."</p>
<p>He shook his head reproachfully at me, and told me that
I'd had a crack on the "nut".  When I pressed him as
to who had been so kind as to see me safely home, he
wouldn't answer, but went on brushing the mud still
more firmly in.</p>
<p>"Beggin' your pardon, sir, I hauled on your legs—a
little," he said at last.  "An' I'm feared that 'twas I who
split them trouses."  He said it as if he didn't think he'd
done a very praiseworthy thing in probably saving my life;
possibly he hadn't.</p>
<p>"I'll double your pay, Grainger; 'twas jolly good of
you.  Hope you came out of it all right?"</p>
<p>"I came out of it all right.  I don't go ashore on one of
these 'ere shows with my second best things on.  Thank
you very much, sir, but you've forgot to pay me anything
for the last three months."</p>
<p>I knew that perfectly well, and it closed the discussion.
Financial matters are peculiarly distressing to me in the
early morning.</p>
<p>He roused me presently with "'Ere's your usual breakfast,
sir," and put down a tray with a bottle of soda water
and a biscuit on it, and looked amazed when I clambered
out and demanded shaving water and a bath.  It was
somewhat out of my ordinary routine to turn out much
before 9.30, and he, I saw, thought that that crack on my
head had affected my brain.</p>
<p>The old Skipper came in whilst I was dressing.  I had
never seen the old chap so gentle.  "I'm all right, sir,
thank you—right as a trivet—my head's the only part of
me which would have stood it.  Very sorry we couldn't
do much for you last night.  How's the Commander?"</p>
<p>"Umph!  Can't say.  Mayhew can't say either.  Pretty
bad, I fear.  The others are doing all right.  Ran you
up against a bigger thing than I thought.  'Old Lest's'
sorry."</p>
<p>"Fortune of war, sir.  I'm paid twelve-and-sevenpence
a day for it by a grateful country—less income tax."</p>
<p>The dear old chap grunted and went out again.</p>
<p>It wasn't till I went into the ward room that I heard
that, besides young Ford and Tuck missing, Martin, one
of my chaps, and Miller, an armourer belonging to
Whitmore's party, had been left behind.</p>
<p>The Skipper sent a boat to try and communicate with
the pirates, and find out whether young Ford and these
two men were alive and kicking.  The boss pirate man
was most polite, wrote back that they were doing well
(we didn't know whether that meant that they were
wounded or not), and implored the Skipper not to
attack the island again, as he was certain that it would
provoke a massacre, or something equally unpleasant, of
all the Europeans there, including little Sally Hobbs herself.</p>
<p>He added that he was keeping his prisoners, and as
they would probably be the first victims, he thought this
knowledge might add force to his entreaties to be let
alone.</p>
<p>He didn't know "Old Lest"—not by a long chalk.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> turned up during the morning, and that
chap Ching (he was a good enough chap to have been
a marine, if they had luxuries like that in the Chinese
navy) and the skippers of the <emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> and <emphasis>Sparrow</emphasis>
came across to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and had a regular
pow-wow, talkee-talkee in the Captain's cabin.</p>
<p>Ching was to land at sunset with some fifty of his men,
and Hoffman was to go with him and guide him across
country, straight to the walled house on the hill.  They
were to get through at all costs.  It was Ching's own
suggestion; he and Hoffman thought they could do it,
and I knew they would, if it was possible.  Whilst he
made a dash for the house, all the ships were to plug
shell at two places in the island, some distance from the
town itself, in order to distract their attention.</p>
<p>Hoffman wasn't exactly dead, but that was about all
you could say.  He must have had an enormous amount
of vitality, or whatever you call it, to keep "going".
He looked most ghastly ill.</p>
<p>It was determined that every man we could fit out with
a rifle and other conveniences for hurrying his "dear
brethren" into eternity was to land from the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> and
the four gunboats about an hour after Ching, and the
whole day was spent in communicating with the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>
and the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> and completing these arrangements.</p>
<p>I've always longed to be a pirate myself, and the next
best thing was to have the job of collaring one.  My
detachment were just as keen as I was, especially after
last night's shindy, and we fell in again and prepared
to land, and have another go at 'em, as cheerfully as
ducks in a thunderstorm.</p>
<p>"Ever shoved it into a 'uman afore, sir?" Grainger
asked me, whilst he was helping me on with my sword
and leather gear.  He'd been polishing it outside my
cabin, on and off, all day long.</p>
<p>"Never; nothing bigger than a cockroach."</p>
<p>"Well, sir, it 'ull be some'ut to 'ang up in the 'all at
'ome when we draws our pension.  Won't it, sir?"</p>
<p>"If we don't have to pawn it," I told him, and went
off to look at Truscott.  Poor chap! he was worrying
about what would happen to his wife and kids if he
"pegged out", so one couldn't do much to cheer him.
He was very down on his luck.</p>
<p>We were a goodish bit behind time getting ashore, as
the very dickens of a fog came up from the south and
wrapped us in its "blissful mantle of white", as the
young padré would have said if he'd been there.  It was
beastly annoying, and took all the gloss out of my
moustache; but old Lawrence got us round to the back of
the island somehow or other, chiefly by the sound of
the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> guns, I think.  Of course, he jolly well
pretended that he did it with a boat's compass and a
pair of parallel rulers on a chart he'd made.  Bless me!
I never could understand why navigators make such a
song about their job; it's easy enough—shove on till you
hit up against the shore—push off again and go on—that's
all that's wanted.  I bet I would navigate any ship you
liked, anywhere you liked, if she'd stand a bit of bumping
sometimes.  I've often asked Lawrence to let me try, but,
funnily enough, he won't.</p>
<p>I'd had an awful job with Grainger to let me wear my
other serge tunic—my best one—and it was only by telling
him that I wasn't going to bring discredit on "The Corps"
by being found dead in the one I'd worn last night, that
he let me wear it.</p>
<p>"I make it a rule in life," I had told him, "never to wear
any serge in more than one battle," and he had gone away
muttering that "he supposed that they hadn't either of
'em been paid for, and never would be, so it didn't hardly
matter, though he was blowed if he knew what I was
going to wear to-morrow".</p>
<p>Some of his statements were remarkably accurate.
We had brought along one of Hoffman's Chinamen to
guide us, but, bless me! by the time we'd got ashore,
with wet feet, we couldn't see two yards in front of us.
The fog was as thick as pea soup, and it was like trying
to wade through velvet.</p>
<p>I had a pocket compass—we all had—and Lawrence had
given us the course we were to steer, but I'm jiggered if
I know how we got along at all.  I was supposed to be
in front, with people thrown out on either flank, as laid
down in the "drill book", but it was all I could do to
keep them bunched up together, touching each other, and
the section leaders bawling out, every minute or two, to
give the others a notion where they were.  My old
sergeant-major nearly wept because he couldn't know
whether they were "dressed" in proper line.</p>
<p>We stumbled through it somehow, going on for two
minutes and halting for five or ten, whilst they hauled
one of our Maxims along on its carriage behind us, and
the shouting that went on to know who was there, and
where who was, was enough to wake the dead.</p>
<p>The Skipper landed with us, in an old pair of shooting-boots
with huge soles on them—the two-to-an-acre kind—and
with a big oak stick in his hands.  Young Ponsonby
came as his "doggy", and Whitmore had brought
Rawlings as his.  My marines—Langham with the machine gun
section, old "B.-T." with "A" company, and Trevelyan
with "B" company—brought our "field state" up to
a hundred and fifty-four, all of them <emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis>, and
Barclay came along with a dozen stokers as stretcher-bearers.
About two miles to our left, farther along the
island, the other landing party, which was supposed to
make for the walled house, with Sally in it, and join
hands with us there, should have commenced their march
already, but we hadn't the faintest notion whether they'd
been able to find the place to land.  The skipper of the
<emphasis>Omaha</emphasis>, Captain John A. Parkinson, U.S.N.[#], was to
have been in command, and to have had forty men from
his own gunboat and thirty each from our three with him,
bringing their brigade up to a strength of one hundred
and forty-two—that is, with a few details of stretcher
parties.</p>
<p>[#] United States Navy.</p>
<p>We only hoped that they'd been able to find each other
and get ashore.</p>
<p>"'Old Lest' don't care whether they come or not," the
Skipper growled to me, when we'd run up against each
other in the fog.  "'Old Lest's' going on.  Umph!"</p>
<p>Even Blucher was unhappy, and wagged his tail doubtfully.
He had never been on a shooting expedition like
this before, and he didn't know quite what to make of it,
or the fog, and stuck to the Skipper like a leech, for fear
of losing him.</p>
<p>We had heard a lot of desultory firing going on, even
before we had landed, and couldn't quite understand it,
as it came more from the direction of the walled house
than from where Ching should have been; but we did not
worry much about that.</p>
<p>We found ourselves running up against huts and bamboo
fencing about two hours after we'd landed; but there
wasn't a single soul there, and as we were getting out
of them I happened to bump into Trevelyan, who'd lost
himself.  We were wondering what had become of the
inhabitants.</p>
<p>"They've gone into town to the theatre, and supper
afterwards at the Savoy or the Carlton, I expect," he
said jokingly.</p>
<p>"I jolly well wish I had," I said.</p>
<p>That set me thinking of the good times I'd had in
London, and I forgot, for a second, all about the beastly
island and the beastly pirates, but woke up again with
the sound of heavy firing—volleys, too—from the same
place from where we'd heard the firing before.</p>
<p>"That's Ching," I thought; "he's got his hands full."</p>
<p>We ran into some people ourselves in front of us,
heard them yelling, and heard their footsteps, but never
saw them.  There must have been a goodish lot of them,
to judge by the noise they made, and sometimes they fired
rifles, and bullets went by, overhead, but they didn't worry
much, and we pressed them before us.  Eventually they
got all round us, yelling "blue murder", but daren't come
near enough to be "spitted", which was a pity, as their
noise was very irritating, and made the men jumpy.</p>
<p>There was no sound of the other little brigade having
landed, and in about an hour after the heavy firing had
started, it died down again.  We were rather worried lest
this meant that Ching had failed, but an occasional shot
coming from the same direction told us that, at any rate,
he was still holding on.  I don't believe that we made
half a mile in the first three hours, the fog and darkness
were so intense that one actually couldn't see one's hand.</p>
<p>A halt was called—for the hundredth time, I should
imagine—and presently the Skipper came up, singing out
for me, and being passed on from one section to another.
"The first bit of firm ground we come to I'm going to stop
there," he growled.  "It's no use going on like this.  I
haven't the shadowiest idea where I'm going."</p>
<p>"Not the foggiest, I imagine you mean, sir."</p>
<p>"Umph!" he grunted.</p>
<p>He rather liked my polished wit.</p>
<p>It really was the most extraordinary sensation you can
imagine, to go lumbering along at this snail's pace, and
to hear those fellows just ahead booing and yelling, and
to hear them running towards us, shouting something
rude and unladylike and running away, without ever
seeing a soul.</p>
<p>We ran up against a bank shortly afterwards, and
stayed there for the remainder of the night, the fog
sometimes clearing away slightly, but always shutting
down, like a blanket, directly we thought of moving on.
We found a little gap in the bank for the Maxim, and
formed more or less of a hollow square all round it,
with my chaps lining the bank.</p>
<p>We let rip a few rounds from it whenever we thought
we could hear a lot of those fellows close together, and
thought we managed to wing one or two.  We certainly
found two dead pigs in a sty alongside a hut, about
fifty yards away, when the fog did clear away next
morning.  Ask Whitmore about his Maxim gun and the
two pigs; but see that you've got a clear start first!</p>
<p>We made ourselves as cosy as we could—from a "drill
book" point of view, I mean—and had to be on the alert
all night.</p>
<p>The Skipper and Whitmore paced up and down behind
the Maxim gun, the Skipper smoking cigar after cigar,
and worrying a good deal about not being able to get
on.  Old "Blucher" came across to me presently, to
where I was sitting on the trail of the Maxim gun,
eating some sandwiches which Grainger had brought for me,
and telling yarns to young Rawlings and Ponsonby to
pass away the time.  He sat down between my knees
and finished off the gristly parts of the beef inside the
sandwiches, and wanted his ears played with.  He wasn't
at all happy, and the noises all round us and the yelping
of dogs had got on his nerves.</p>
<p>I had thrown out half a dozen marines as sentries—only
ten yards in front of our bank—and one or other of them
kept on letting off their rifles and scooting back.  I had to
lead them out again, firmly but gently.  It's bad enough
on an ordinary dark night to have to do sentry business,
but in this fog, when you couldn't see anyone till he
touched you, it was only the steadiest old soldier who
could "stick" it.  I was at last compelled to keep
walking from one to another myself, and spent most of the
night doing this.</p>
<p>There were one or two, what you might call, "incidents".</p>
<p>One happened, once, when I'd brought Rawlings and
Ponsonby with me, and stumbled over a Chinaman, crawling
along the ground.  He fled like a rabbit, but the two
mids were on him like terriers, I shouting all the time for
them to come back.  There were two or three revolver
shots, which started all my sentries easing "off", and
then back they came, bubbling over with excitement.
It was lucky that my chaps hadn't shot them.</p>
<p>"Bagged him?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Rather!  Got him with my second; he ran into a tree,"
Rawlings said, but Ponsonby was much too excited to
speak.</p>
<p>The other incident occurred just before we shoved on
again.</p>
<p>I had put one of my "bad hats"—an old villain who
spent most of his time doing "cells" and 10A[#]—on the
extreme left of the line of sentries, and I thought I had
heard a bit of a scuffle somewhere in his direction, and
presently managed to find him.  He was standing over
a Chinaman, perfectly unconcerned.  "Killed that 'ere
little lot, sir; crawled up to me and was going to knife
me—the dirty thief; did it with this bagonet—'arf an
'our ago, sir."</p>
</section>
<section>
<empty-line/>
<p>[#] 10A.—A particular scale of punishment.</p>
<p>"I wonder you didn't shoot him," I said.  And he
snorted, "There's plenty as would 'ave," and gave the
body a kick, "plenty as would 'ave, and waked the 'ole
blooming camp."</p>
<p>When he was eventually relieved, he dragged it back
with him to show his pals, and kept the knife as a trophy.
The fog began to clear away about six o'clock in the
morning, and as it gradually became possible to see a
few yards ahead, we shoved again.  We had just got
up to the hut and pigsty I told you about, and were
chaffing Whitmore about the effect of his Maxim, when
we heard, about a mile off, the report of a gun.  The
Skipper came swaggering up, his fierce old eyebrows
covered with fog (all of us were as wet as drowned
rats with it)—"What's that, Marshall?  What d'you
make of that?  Field gun, eh?"</p>
<p>"Sounds like it, sir;" and we heard it fire again, and it
went on regularly at about three or four minute intervals.
We could hear volleys, too, all from the same direction,
and felt pretty certain that good old Ching hadn't let them
have it all their own way.</p>
<p>"It means that they're shelling that house.  Umph!
And that means that Ching has got inside it," the Skipper
growled, rubbing his great hands in delight.</p>
<p>"Shove on!  They've been waiting for us too long
already;" and he came along with me, Blucher yawning
behind him, and wondering, I suppose, when his job was
coming on.</p>
<p>Directly we had moved forward we stirred up some
Chinamen in front of us; but they were not giving us
much trouble, and we now felt a breeze in our faces,
and saw the fog streaming across our front.  Almost
immediately afterwards we heard firing away to our left,
where the other "landing party" ought to be, and were
jolly pleased, and knew that the fog must have "lifted"
over there as well.</p>
<p>"We shall have it clear in another quarter of an hour,"
the Skipper growled, and went back to hurry everyone
forward, for that gun ahead of us was firing regularly,
and made us all rather dread what was happening.</p>
<p>We were getting on some high ground now, making
fine progress, and almost before you could tell when it
happened, or how long it took to clear, the fog had swept
past us, and, quite suddenly, we saw frightened Chinamen
flying in front of us, to take cover behind a bank
somewhere about a quarter of a mile away.  I couldn't help
laughing to see them tumbling over each other in their
hurry to escape, now that the fog had uncovered them.
We bagged a good many before they got over that bank.</p>
<p>"Don't give 'em any time; after 'em, Marshall," I heard
the Skipper shouting, and we simply did a record sprint,
"Blucher" going on ahead of us, thinking that his show
had come along at last, and barking loudly, like the
useless, untrained, old brute he was.  We were over that
bank before they could fife half a dozen shots, and had
bayoneted half a dozen before you could say "Jack
Robinson".  My men were so glad to get a sight of the
fellows who'd been worrying them all night, and were so
keen to pay them "out", that there was no stopping
them.  Those few shots, though, were quite enough for
old "Blucher", who went yelping back to the Skipper,
with his tail between his legs, more mystified than ever.</p>
<p>The ground sloped upwards behind the bank, and we
were after them like redshanks.  I knew that Trevelyan
with "B" company was somewhere on my right, and that
"B.-T." was coming along in reserve, and that the Maxim
kept chipping in occasionally; but I had all my work cut
out to keep my marines in hand, and did not pay much
attention to anything else.  One or two of my chaps
got bowled over before we got to the top of the slope;
but we were up it and over it in a "jiffy", and saw the
cowardly brutes running down the other side, dodging in
between some native graves and some big boulders, and
shooting up at us.</p>
<p>I made my men halt and take cover to get their breath,
and waited for the Skipper.  He came grunting and
puffing after me.</p>
<p>After that beastly night, it was grand to be able to use
one's eyes again, and see where we were and what we
were doing.  The ground sloped down from our feet to a
little shallow valley of paddy fields, intersected by banks
and small irrigation streams.  It rose again on the
opposite side to form a ridge about eight hundred yards away,
a little tree-topped ridge, with the walled house, where
Ching and Sally and all the rest of them were, at its right
end, and a few huts on its left end.</p>
<p>As the Skipper came up, I saw a cloud of white smoke
burst out from behind those huts, and heard that gun fire
again.  I pointed it out to him.</p>
<p>"There's someone showing on top of that house, sir,"
Trevelyan sang out.</p>
<p>"Where's one of the signalmen?" the Skipper roared.
"There you are—are you—wave something; get on top of
that hut and wave your flags."  (We were standing close
to a small mud hut.)</p>
<p>"He'll draw their fire all right," I chuckled to
Trevelyan—there were a good many bullets flying past us—and
when he did scramble up to the top and begin waving
his semaphore flags, they left off firing at us, and paid
all their attention to him, bullets whistling round him and
smacking up against the side of the hut.</p>
<p>"A jolly good 'wheeze' that," and Trevelyan winked
at me.  "You must put that in your blessed drill book,
eh, soldier?"</p>
<p>The signalman stood there with his telescope between
his knees, calmly trying to attract attention, whilst the
Skipper stood below and cursed him, and "Blucher"
went smelling up every time a bullet splodged against
the mud wall, and then ran away, thinking people were
throwing stones at him.  He didn't know what to make
of this picnic.</p>
<p>"There's someone waving on top of that house,"
several sang out; and we saw someone "wagging" a
long stick.</p>
<p>"'E's only got one arm, whoever 'e is," the signalman
muttered, "an' 'e don't know much about Morse."</p>
<p>"It's Mr. Ford, sir," he sang out.  "He says, 'All well
so far—Mr. Ching here—gun doing damage'."</p>
<p>"Splendid!" we all shouted; and just then the signalman
came toppling down with a bullet through his leg,
and sat there holding it and looking very white.</p>
<p>Old Barclay was on him in a moment—terrible keen
chap he was.</p>
<p>When we looked again, young Ford had disappeared.
I expect that he had found it a pretty warm corner up
there.</p>
<p>Old "B.-T.'s" little lot in the rear were having trouble
now.  They were below us, at the foot of the slope we had
just climbed, and were lying down and shooting at a crowd
of Chinese clustering round the huts near that pigsty.</p>
<p>"We must have got round 'em in the fog," Trevelyan
chuckled.</p>
<p>"Where's that darned Maxim?" the Skipper roared.
"Get it up here."</p>
<p>Young Rawlings rushed away to hurry it, and it came
rattling up, Langham, who was in charge of it, and his
men panting and tugging for all they were worth.</p>
<p>He was ordered to try and stop that gun firing, and
then fat little Ponsonby was sent flying downhill to tell
Travers to leave the Chinamen alone and come along
after us.</p>
<p>The Maxim gun began its "tut-tut-tut-tut", "B.-T."
and his chaps came bounding up the hill, and we all
roared with laughter as little Ponsonby came running
after them, his eyes and mouth wide open with fright
at being left behind.  "B.-T." was sent down the slope
in front of us, with his company, to clear out the chaps
who were sniping us; and very prettily he and his two
Mids, Jones and Withers, did the job, whilst Trevelyan
looked after the brutes in our rear.</p>
<p>They were simply swarming down there behind those
huts, and there was not the least doubt that we had got
round their main body in the fog.  They did not dare
to come out in the open, and were keeping up a very
wild fire at us.</p>
<p>Langham couldn't get near that gun, and just as it
fired again, and someone had sung out that they could
see stones and bits of wood flying from a corner of the
house, we saw Chinamen streaming across the paddy
fields on our left, running and turning, and firing
backwards.  We could hear heavy firing from somewhere out
of sight, and the noise of another Maxim and the
chip-chip of a Colt automatic gun.</p>
<p>We all knew that it was the gunboat's brigade driving
the Chinese in front of them.</p>
<p>"The other chaps will be there before 'Old Lest', if we
don't get a move on.  'Old Lest' ain't going to be
beaten by them," the Skipper grunted, and sent me and
my marines flying down into the paddy fields below us,
after Travers, who had halted and taken cover behind
a bank on the other side of them, just before the ground
began to rise gently up towards the walled house, and
where the gun was a little farther to the left.</p>
<p>"Take ground to your left, and both of you 'go' for
that confounded gun," the Skipper had roared after me.
"I'm coming along after you."</p>
<p>It's all jolly fine to tell one to charge along through
paddy fields.  Grainger was just behind me, and I felt
sorry for him, because I kept on going in up to my
knees in beautiful, rich, black mud, and knew that he had
his eye on me and my second best pair of trousers.  But
we got up to old "B.-T." all right, and I shouted for him
to come along and shove on for the gun, got my men
extended well to the left, gave them a "breather" whilst
he swung his men a little to the left as well (brought
his right shoulder up, as they say in the drill book), and
then off we went, howling and cheering, straight towards
two little white huts behind which the gun was still
firing.</p>
<p>Whitmore appeared from somewhere and took charge
(he was the senior), Rawlings and a bugler boy legging it
after him for all they were worth.</p>
<p>A good many bullets came whizzing past, and I saw
chaps dodging about round those huts and under some
trees.  My men were coming along well, and old "B.-T."
with his long legs was sprinting along in front of his
chaps like a camel.</p>
<p>Away to the left people began cheering—"Rah!  Rah!
Rah!"—and I knew that came from the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> crowd,
and wasn't going to be beaten by them.  Nor was
more either; and though I knew that the "show" was not
quite according to the "drill book", I wasn't going to let
the "U.S.N." or our gunboats get there first.</p>
<p>Young Wilkins, running just behind me, gave a cry and
fell; I heard the old sergeant-major cursing and hurrying
on the men; we got in among the trees, my chaps half
a dozen paces behind me; a chap got in my way and
fell down—I suppose I did it; two or three fellows rushed
out from the side of a hut and came for me with swords;
but the well-beloved Grainger wasn't going to let them
damage my best "serge", if he could prevent it, and we
got rid of them between us.  "B.-T.'s" chaps and mine
were now all mixed up.  There were a few "bickerings"
going on round the huts and among the trees, and then
we saw the gun standing by its "lonesome", and went
dashing across to it.</p>
<p>One of "B.-T.'s" able seamen was the first to get to it,
Whitmore and Rawlings close behind, and "B.-T." and I
made a dead heat for fourth place.</p>
<p>"Don't 'hee-haw' like a jackass," Whitmore said, when
he'd got his breath.  "What's to be done now?"</p>
<p>I'm hanged if I could help laughing at the sight of old
"B.-T." legging it, with little Withers, only about half his
height, trying to keep up with him.</p>
<p>"Give us a cigarette, and don't be an ass, soldier!"
"B.-T." sang out.  "Your legs are funnier looking
than mine, any day."</p>
<p>"Drill book, Whitmore, old chap!  Drill book!  When
you've got 'em on the run, keep 'em on the run," I said,
when I could stop laughing, and he agreed, and "B.-T."
agreed, and we got our people together and followed them.
As we left the gun we saw the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> people "doubling"
up to it.</p>
<p>We must have followed them for the best part of a mile,
I should imagine, but they ran a jolly sight faster than we
could.  We were pretty well "winded", and when we'd
driven them back to the outskirts of the town, they
rallied there, and we had to pull up and go back again,
carrying along three fellows who'd been knocked over
in the last hundred yards.  They began pressing along
after us, and a lot of chaps—some of those who had
run away from the other brigade—began worrying our
flank, streaming across the paddy fields and firing at
us.  We managed to keep them back, alternate sections
lying down and firing whilst the others ran back fifty
yards and lay down in their turn, and covered the retreat
of the first little lot.  A nice little show it was too—all
done according to the drill book—and when we'd got
back to within a hundred yards of the walled house,
and were passing through the remains of a lot of burnt
huts, young Ponsonby came running up with orders from
the Skipper to halt there and take up a position.</p>
<p>"He's pretty angry, sir," he told Whitmore; "he's been
sounding the recall for the last half-hour."</p>
<p>The fact was that the Chinese hadn't yet had a sufficient
lesson, and didn't quite know what it was to run up against
us in the daylight, and were now coming for us "hammer
and tongs".</p>
<p>Instead of going back to the walled house, and bending
on one knee before Princess Sally as her gallant knight,
who had lost a couple of eyeglasses, and spoiled serge
frocks, two in number, and two pairs of embroidered
overalls—bills not yet paid—in her service, and receiving
her gracious thanks, I had jolly well to dodge beastly
bullets for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>The old Skipper often came round, with "Blucher", to
see if things were going all right, and generally stopped to
have a yarn with me.</p>
<p>It was from him I learnt that poor old Hoffman had
been killed.</p>
<p>"Jolly hard luck after all he's done for us, sir," I had
said; but the Skipper only growled "Umph!" and for
some reason or other didn't seem so sure.</p>
<p>He had managed to get a signal through to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>,
and ordered her and the gunboats to shell the town
and that six-inch gun which Whitmore had tried to
destroy.</p>
<p>From my position, looking across the Chinese town
and the little creek crowded with junks, I could see
them steaming slowly inshore, and presently they began
firing very deliberately.  (Of course they had only a few
seaman ratings left on board to man the guns.)</p>
<p>Their shells burst all over the town; but it takes a lot of
shells to set fire to a house, and it was some time before
they got a good fire going.  A few shells which didn't
burst ricochetted over our heads, and one or two fell
pretty close to the house; but the Skipper didn't worry
about them now.  He had lowered little Sally down a
shallow well, somewhere in the garden behind the house,
and so long as she was safe, he didn't worry about anyone
else.</p>
<p>His idea was that if we set fire to the town, most of the
people would go back there to try and extinguish the
flames, and that then we would tramp back across the
island to where we had landed last night.</p>
<p>Certainly a good number of fellows did go back, and
except from that hill on the other side of the paddy fields,
from where we had seen Ford's signal, we were not much
bothered with rifle fire.</p>
<p>It was at the back of the house, where the ground fell
steeply towards the creek, and was covered with scrubby
bushes, that the Chinese seemed now to be trying to force
their way in.  The lower slopes were simply swarming
with them, and more kept moving up the creek in boats
to assist them.</p>
<p>The Skipper came across to me.  "Umph!" he growled.
"You're a soldier, aren't you?" and when I had acknowledged
the soft impeachment, "Umph!  What would you
do?  I'm not a soldier.  'Old Lest's' not much good ashore
except after 'birds'.  How'd you get out of this mess!
Ugh!" and he growled at me as if he would have liked to
eat me, and so fiercely that old "Blucher" thought he was
in for a row, and cleared off to have a yarn with his chums,
the marines.  He took me across, behind the house, to
have a look at the state of affairs there.</p>
<p>Don't think that he wanted advice.  He only wanted
someone to talk to, and everyone else was too busy.  I
wouldn't have suggested anything to him for "worlds".</p>
<p>It was then that I saw Hobbs and Sally for the first
time since they had been "burgled".  They had fished her
up from the well, and she had come across to the Skipper,
looking like a ghost, her sad little face all pinched and
careworn, hardly the princess I'd all my life been longing
to rescue, and throw myself and all my unpaid bills at her
feet.  She was a most distressful little object, and when
the Skipper put his great hand very gently on her
shoulder, and told her we were going to start off
almost directly, she began crying, and said she didn't
want to go.</p>
<p>"She's gone daft about that man Evans," Hobbs whispered
to me.  He looked more like a monkey than ever.</p>
<p>So that was it, was it?  And our little princess didn't
want to be rescued!  Poor little princess!  I just noticed
that the front of the house had been pretty well battered
in by the Chinese gun, and then caught sight of Ford and
Rawlings looking like long-lost brothers.  Ford was a
pretty ludicrous spectacle, with one side of his face black
and blue, one eye closed, and his left arm slung up inside
his monkey jacket.  This was the first time I had seen him
since we had landed to destroy that gun, and he got very
red; I remembered that he hadn't taken my jokes in very
good part, so went across to make my peace with him.</p>
<p>"We all saw you signalling to us this morning, Ford,
on the top of that roof.  You must have been under
a very hot fire, eh?"</p>
<p>He wasn't quite certain whether he was going to make
peace, but he couldn't stand out against a little delicate
flattery, and we made friends again, and he went off with
Rawlings, looking very conceited and happy.</p>
<p>Fat little Rashleigh was there, too, buzzing about like a
bumble bee, and offering everyone a drink from his flask,
and patronizing Ching, and talking about the gun he had
captured.  I never realized what he meant till afterwards.</p>
<p>Old Ching was pretty well played out, but looked proud
and happy, and I gave him one of my last three cigarettes,
and told him one or two yarns, though he didn't take
much interest in them, and kept his eyes fixed on little
Sally.</p>
<p>The Skipper had given him the job of escorting her
down to the coast, and jolly well he had earned it too.</p>
<p>Parkinson, the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> skipper, had a yarn with me.
"Guess I shall be a flag officer before I'm sixty.  Reckon
they'll have my picture in all the journals in the States,
and maybe they'll remember John A. Parkinson is still
alive and kicking, up at Washington.  They seem to
have forgotten him awhile."  He was "talking
sarcastic".  He was a fine grim-looking chap, without an
ounce of spare flesh on him, and as old as most of the
rear-admirals in our navy, though only in command of
a small gunboat.</p>
<p>There was an old Scotchman who had helped Ford and
the two men escape from the town to the walled house,
and had been helping to defend it all night.  He was a
funny old bird, and didn't quite know where to "place"
himself, and wasn't looking particularly happy.  Old
"B.-T." had recognized him as the chap who'd run the
show at the other island, when "B.-T." was a prisoner, so
he knew that we had sufficient evidence to hang him, and
was only too jolly anxious to escape being killed by
Chinamen in the meantime.</p>
<p>He thought that our best plan would be to go back
the way we had come.  It was more open country, and,
except for the first three-quarters of a mile, better "going"
and more open than if we attempted to work round the
outskirts of the town itself, where the ground was nothing
but swamps.</p>
<p>It was now about half-past one o'clock, and the Skipper
thought that it was about time to be starting back.</p>
<p>The great trouble was the number of wounded who
would have to be carried.  Of Ching's original fifty men
only forty-two could walk, and the two landing parties
now had six men too badly wounded to walk.  Young
Wilkins, my bugler, and a seaman belonging to the
<emphasis>Goldfinch</emphasis> were the only two Englishmen killed so far.</p>
<p>These two, Hoffman, and five of Ching's people had been
buried during the morning, under the trees in the garden,
behind the house.</p>
<p>The Skipper also wanted to go back the way he
had come.  He told me that I should have the first
job—to seize the hill opposite us across the paddy fields and
hold it whilst he, Trevelyan, and "B" company and
Ching's bluejackets brought along Sally, her father, and
the wounded.</p>
<p>Parkinson, the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> skipper, was to stay behind
with the gunboat's brigade and act as rearguard till
the Skipper had got safely across to me, and then I
was going to do "rearguard", whilst they all went on.</p>
<p>He hoped to get in touch with the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and
<emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> a mile from the shore and obtain some
assistance from their guns, if he was much pressed by the
Chinese.  He was just going to give the order to "carry
on", when we saw a little party of people approaching with
a white flag waving over their heads.  It was headed
by a most respectable-looking old "josser" beautifully
dressed in silks, with a mandarin button on his cap,
and a most benign, fatherly expression on his face.  He
was brought along to the Skipper, and the old Scotchman
acted as interpreter.</p>
<p>He had come to offer to let us go back to our ships
without being molested, if we would only leave off shelling
the town, and was very surprised when the Skipper
refused to do so.  Then he called up a man who was
standing behind him with a bundle in his hand, and made him
empty it on the ground, looking at us and expecting to see
us beam with delight.  Ugh!  I was nearly sick, for out
rolled the head of a white man.</p>
<p>"It's Boss Evans!" I heard the Scotchman mutter
under his breath.</p>
<p>We all involuntarily stepped back in disgust, and the
old gentleman opened his eyes in amazement when he saw
that we were not pleased, and explained that it was the
Boss Pirate himself, the chap who'd done everything he
ought not to have done, and that now they had killed him,
and that we had seen that he was really dead, and had got
Hobbs and the girl, "it all makee end—all belong plenty
too much bobberie—no can do—vely good—vely good",
and he rubbed his hands together, and bowed and beamed
at us again from behind his great horn-rimmed spectacles.</p>
<p>"Chuck him out!" the Skipper roared, and walked away.</p>
<p>The poor dear old Chinee chap was almost in tears
when he was led home again, and wasn't allowed to
take the head with him either.</p>
<p>We buried it alongside the other dead.</p>
<p>Someone must have told my poor little princess, because
she was now only too anxious to get away, and looked
more mournful and heartbroken than ever.</p>
<p>It was half-past two before this little business was
concluded, and Whitmore and I were jolly anxious to start.</p>
<p>"The old man's wasting daylight with a vengeance,"
he said to me, but had hardly spoken before young
Ponsonby came running up—"From the Captain, sir; you're
to carry on."</p>
<p>As I hurried past the Skipper, he sang out, "Drive
those fellows off that hill!"—pointing with his big stick.
"Travers will go with you, and I'll send a Maxim along
after you, and am coming on directly."</p>
<p>"Very good, sir," and I saluted and went off to tell my
men what we had to do, and sang out to Travers, "Come
along, old 'B.-T.', bring your people along."</p>
<p>We started off.</p>

<p>Old "B.-T." and I extended our people, ran down
towards the paddy fields, crawled and dodged across them,
and prepared for the "do-or-die business" up the farther
slope.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a rush, and old "B.-T." looked "bored"
when we met again at the top.  The blighters had never
given us a show, but had cleared out, pretty well most
of them.  A few had run into "B.-T.'s" little lot by
accident, and been polished off, that was all.</p>
<p>I don't suppose that they were expecting us to go at 'em
so soon.</p>
<p>The Maxim came along after us, and we helped Langham
up with it, and spread ourselves out, to cover the
retreat of the Skipper with the main body, which came
along almost immediately in a long line, slowly trailing
down the side of the hill from the house.  We could see
that they were carrying the wounded, and they had got
halfway across the paddy fields before the Chinese seemed
to "tumble" to the fact that we were clearing out, and
began to pour back from the outskirts of the town and
open fire at them.</p>
<p>"B.-T." and I managed to keep them in check, and
the Skipper got across without any casualties, "Blucher"
coming galloping up the hill, wagging his long whip of
a tail when he spotted me.</p>
<p>But by this time a number of Chinese had crept along
behind the banks intersecting the paddy fields, and we
couldn't get at them with rifle fire.  They were right in
between us and the walled house, cutting off Parkinson's
retreat.</p>
<p>We could hear that he was having trouble—he was
firing very heavily—and directly the Skipper and his little
lot had got across safely, we saw his people begin leaving
the house and falling back down the slope.  We saw them
turning and firing back, and retiring by alternate
companies, and natives were swarming round the house and
among the trees at the top of the ridge.  We knew that
they must be having a pretty warm time of it.</p>
<p>Those fellows who had crept round their rear began
firing at them too; but one of their companies simply
charged down at them, broke right through, and, opening
out to left and right, swept them on one side.  They were
the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> men.  We could tell that by the peculiar
noise they made and by their uniform.  Langham was
able to let rip into the Chinese as they sprinted out of
reach of the Yankee bayonets, and hurried them along
"pretty considerable", as Parkinson told me afterwards,
we were also able to stop the people swarming down that
ridge after him, and gave him time to bring along his
Maxim and Colt guns, and to extricate himself from rather
an awkward position.  He made a wide sweep, so as not
to mask our fire, and came across; but I saw that he had
to carry four or five men, who had been knocked over
in the open, and they delayed him much.</p>
<p>That is always the rotten part of a retreat, especially
when fighting semi-barbarous natives.  One dare not leave
the wounded behind, and each one who cannot walk
requires two able-bodied men to carry him.</p>
<p>From where "B.-T." and I were standing, I should
think that we could see at least seven hundred Chinamen,
and away on the left, we could see any number more
hurrying: from the town.</p>
<p>"Buck up, old chap!  Don't look so blooming bored!"
and I slapped him on the back.  "We'll have our work
cut out in the next half-hour, when we are doing
rearguard."</p>
<p>"Keep your beastly fists to yourself," he growled.</p>
<p>Old "Blucher" had bounded back to the Captain
directly our Maxim had begun firing.</p>
<p>"Old Lest" and his little lot were in the rear of our
hill—at the bottom of it—waiting for Parkinson to go
on past them, farther back.  We saw Parkinson drop
his wounded people and sweep past and away towards
two small rising bits of ground, about four hundred
yards in the rear, and the Skipper, picking up his
wounded, followed slowly.</p>
<p>Then came our turn as rearguard.</p>
<p>My Christopher Columbus! we had about all we
could do to keep the beggars back.  The heathen
Chinee was simply seeing "red", and came charging
across the paddy fields, rushing up towards the slope
in front of us, and getting round both our flanks.
They thought that they'd got us in a hole, I expect,
and they spared a couple of hundred fellows to sneak
away to the right, behind some banks, hoping to catch
the Skipper in the open.  They would have done it too,
and got right on top of him before he could have spotted
them, had not "B.-T." taken half his company down the
hill at a run, and posted himself behind a couple of
broken-down huts and a bit of another bank, and given
'em "beans" as they went doubling along below him.
It was really a race who should get to the bank first,
and old "B.-T." won.</p>
<p>They were now actually crawling up the hill in front
of my chaps, dodging among the "scrub" and among
the grave mounds, and they were getting round my left
rear as well.  There must have been four or five hundred
of them, and they were taking cover so well, that it made
it confoundedly difficult to hit them.</p>
<p>Langham caught a few of them in the open with the
Maxim; but it's such a jolly extravagant kind of weapon
as regards ammunition, and puts a dozen cartridges into
a chap before another can take his place, and get his
own share.</p>
<p>Young Withers was in command of the other half of
"B.-T.'s" company of bluejackets on my left.  I sent one of
my chaps across to him to tell him to retire, and he began
to fall back steadily.  He was keeping his head, but
looking very white.  Langham's Maxim section began to haul
their gun back, and everyone was a bit flurried.  Two
men got bowled over.  One sprang straight up, with one
hand clawing the air, and I knew that he was shot
through the heart.  I've seen a good many men do that
in my time, and they all had been shot through the heart.</p>
<p>I had a funny feeling in my right arm, too, and guessed
that it had got in the way of a bullet, but could move it
all right.</p>
<p>I looked back to see whether the skipper had got safely
across yet, and saw that he was just disappearing between
the two little hills or ridges which Parkinson was holding;
so it was time for me to be off, and we began to retire
according to the laws and regulations of the dear old
drill book.  I sent the Maxim downhill with a run, and
Withers and his half company with it, to get behind a
bit of a bank two hundred yards in the rear, and held
on with my marines, dropping a few Chinese who were
brave enough to stand up and show themselves; but most
of the skunks were simply wriggling along from one bush
or grave mound to another, and I'm jiggered if you can
hit a man who's crawling and dodging—that is, when
you are excited, and your heart is trying to thump its
way out of your chest, and you are expecting the order to
retire and have one eye on the rear.</p>
<p>They began to get round my right flank then, and I was
beginning to think that "little James" was in a pretty
tight corner, when old "B.-T." saw them and came back,
just in time, cheering as if he was winning the battle
of Waterloo and Trafalgar all rolled into one, and went
careering right into them.</p>
<p>This checked them for half a minute, and gave my
people time to drag our wounded man—I had to leave
the dead one—down the hill, and for the rest of us to
fall back together halfway down the slope.</p>
<p>"B.-T." came along after us, and we faced round and
walked backwards very slowly, and they didn't like the
look of our bayonets and wouldn't charge down, though
they were swarming up above us and yelling like stuck
pigs.  (If they had charged they would have swept clean
over us.)  We managed to bring along two more of my
chaps who were hit and couldn't walk, and sent them
on to the rear, and when we got to level ground
again we opened out, and bolted for where the Maxim
and "B.-T.'s" other half company were.  They gave
them blue blazes as they came screaming after us, and
dropped dozens.</p>
<p>I saw one of the bluejackets fall forward, his head
striking the soft ground, and go slithering along.  The
Chinese were not twenty yards behind, so "B.-T." and
two of his chaps stopped and tried to bring him with
them.  Old "B.-T." had to do a bit of work with his
sword and revolver for a minute or two; but we'd got
our breath behind the bank, came along to his rescue,
and beat 'em back, Langham picking the fellow up like
a sack of corn and carrying him to the rear.</p>
<p>"Look at that rotten thing," "B.-T." panted out, as
he got behind the Maxim, holding out his arm and
showing me where his sword had broken off, about twelve
inches from the hilt.</p>
<p>"If you <emphasis>will</emphasis> do the V.C. act, old chap, with a rotten
tailor-made sword, what can you expect?" I told him.</p>
<p>The Chinese daren't face our fire in the open, and funked
it, so that we were able to fall back again all serenely.  It
wasn't the fear of seeing any of our people getting killed
that worried me then; it was the dread of seeing them
wounded so badly that they had to be carried, because,
as I told you before, each one so wounded meant two
sound men to carry him away, and handicapped us so
tremendously.</p>
<p>We were behind Parkinson now, and gave our wounded
to the Skipper's main body.  I caught a glimpse of "Old
Lest" standing, with his great feet wide apart, and of
"Blucher" squatting between them.  He was watching
the Chinese through his glasses, and young Ford and
Ponsonby were standing close to him, looking white and
nervous.  He shouted out, "Well done, rearguard!" and
we hurried past and came to a group of Chinese
bluejackets, standing shoulder to shoulder.  In the middle
of them, I knew, was my poor little princess and her
miserable little father.  You see, bullets were still coming
past pretty thickly, and Ching was shielding her with his
men's bodies.</p>
<p>That old Chinese gun was there too, with some of the
<emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> people to drag it, and a few yards farther along
half a company of Trevelyan's men were sitting on the
ground resting till they had to move on again.</p>
<p>They gave us a cheer as we passed them, jumping
to their feet and waving their caps, and off we went at
the double for a low ridge about a quarter of a mile
farther to the rear.  We expected to be able to see the
gunboats from there, and were ordered to try and attract
their attention.  They had been told to keep a lookout
for us.</p>
<p>This bit was only a case of speed, and we were all
blowing like grampuses when we stopped, and the men
flung themselves down and faced round, my little lot
about a hundred yards from "B.-T.'s", with Langham
and his Maxim between us.</p>
<p>Some of his people had tied their silk handkerchiefs to
their bayonets and were waving them to attract the
gunboats.  I heard "B.-T." yell something, and saw him
pointing away towards the sea.</p>
<p>It was there all right, but, buttered crumpets! a
beastly fog-bank, like a solid wall of cotton wool, was
creeping down from wind'ard.  When I first looked I
could see the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> one mast and tall funnel, but
three minutes afterwards the fog had blotted her out of
sight, and I could watch it creeping towards the shore.
Great bluebottles!  I didn't like it; another night like last
night would about send me off my "crumpet".</p>
<p>I was just thinking that it would have been better for
me to have gone into the Church, as my old dad always
had wished, when Withers came running across to ask if I
could lend "B.-T." a cigarette.</p>
<p>"You might get your pater to give me one of his
livings," I told him.  "I'm going to be a parson if we
ever get out of this."</p>
<p>"He's very particular, sir," the cheeky young rascal
grinned, and ran back with my last cigarette.  Old
"B.-T." would have borrowed my matchbox, but I sent
Withers to tell him to <emphasis>rub two sticks together</emphasis> and light
it that way; it would be good exercise, and the cigarette
would last longer.</p>
<p>I saw him shake his fist at me when he got the message,
and then walk down his line of men to try and borrow a
match from one of them.</p>
<p>The main body was coming past now; Whitmore and
Rawlings, at the head of the little column, were just
passing Langham's Maxim; then Trevelyan's right half
company, a dozen Chinese bluejackets in a circle round
Sally and Hobbs, with Ching and the old Scotchman
walking behind them.  Then there was a gap, a long
string of Chinese bluejackets carrying their wounded, the
rest of Trevelyan's chaps carrying ours, the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis>
people dragging the little Chinese field gun, and
Trevelyan with a few men bringing up the rear.</p>
<p>They came to a halt behind us, and laid down their
wounded very gently.</p>
<p>"There's no one behind us, I think," "B.-T." shouted
to Whitmore.  "But just look at that fog!  It's hidden
the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> since we've been up here."</p>
<p>"Where's the Skipper?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Taking charge of the rearguard.  This job isn't exciting
enough for him.  They'll have all their work cut out
to get back to us, and I don't know what will happen if
we get many more wounded."</p>
<p>I had to go back to my men then, as I saw the
rearguard already on its way, fat little Rashleigh toddling
along in front of two companies from the left of the two
little hills, and the Maxim section rushing their gun
towards us.  From the right the rest of the rearguard
commenced their retreat, and I saw "Old Lest's" great
broad shoulders swaggering back, with Parkinson, as
thin as a lamp-post, striding along beside him, and
"Blucher" slinking between them.</p>
<p>Contrary to Whitmore's opinion, they had very little
trouble in extricating themselves, because the ground was
so flat on the other side of those two little hills, that the
Chinese had not dared to come to close quarters, and
they were more than halfway towards us before the enemy
occupied the slopes they had just evacuated, and stayed
there, contenting themselves with opening a very heavy
but miserably directed fire.  They made rotten shooting.</p>
<p>I felt that we had now got over by far the worst part
of the show, all except the beastly fog part, which had
already hidden the line of the shore a mile away, with
its advance guard of feathery mist quickly creeping along
the ground towards us.</p>
<p>The Skipper came along grunting and growling, lighting
another cigar, and highly pleased with himself and
everything else so far; but when he saw the fog he
stormed and cursed.</p>
<p>"'Old Lest' won't worry about those chaps behind
him.  He'll march straight for the shore," he grunted,
and sent Parkinson and the gunboat's brigade straight
ahead, and ordered my marines and "B.-T.'s" bluejackets
to remain in the rear.  He took charge of the
rearguard himself, but practically gave the job to me.  I
suppose that he knew that I had conducted many skilful
retreats across the exercise ground at Forton Barracks,
so would know all about it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, it was a great compliment to me, and old
Whitmore was as sick as a cat with a fish bone in
its throat, only he tried not to show it.</p>
<p>No one troubled us in front, and we marched along
quite quickly—as quickly as it was possible to carry the
wounded.</p>
<p>It was really a race against the fog.  Everyone knew
that, and we got over the first half-mile without difficulty.</p>
<p>The Chinese were not worrying the rearguard much;
but of course they saw the fog almost as soon as we
did, and many of them began streaming away to the
left and right, and I knew that they would scoot round
our flanks, try and get in between us and the sea, and
hem us in as they had done during the night.  I didn't
like the idea of that—not a little bit.</p>
<p>But with only another half-mile to do, the moist tongues
of fog began drifting overhead, and in five minutes we
couldn't see fifteen yards.  We recognized the huts with
the dead pig's near them, and some of my chaps had a
brilliant idea, and brought them along on their bayonets.
"Wat 'o!  Bill, for a bit of the Gunnery Lootenant's
sucking pigs when we gets aboard," I heard one of them
sing out.</p>
<p>The advance guard halted to let the main body get up
to them, and threw back their flanks to overlap it, and
as we came up we threw forward our flanks, and this
meant that we practically formed a hollow square round
the main body and the wounded.  Like this we marched
very slowly along, keeping in touch by shouting to each
other.  The Chinese were now beginning to draw up to
our rear, and we could hear them yelling and firing rifles
at us, the bullets seeming to make much more noise in
the fog.</p>
<p>They didn't venture close yet.</p>
<p>In another five minutes the fog was so dense that I
couldn't see the third man from me in the ranks.  The
skipper made a bugler with the main body in the centre
sound two "G's" every half-minute, and that was a great
help to us to keep in station.  All round us I could hear
the non-commissioned and petty officers singing out: "Not
so fast on the right!  Keep up on the left!  Close towards
the bugle, you on the flanks!  Where's No. 1 section?
Don't get ahead too far!"</p>
<p>These cries, with the howling of dogs and the yells of
Chinamen, who had got all round us now, were extremely
discomposing.  When presently they did leave off yelling,
and we had no idea where they were gathering or where
they did intend to attack us, I must admit that it was still
more disconcerting.  But we could hear the sea beating
on the shore, and smelt the decaying seaweed, and knew
we should reach it in a few minutes.  The Skipper must
have been a little nervous too, for his bugler sounded the
"halt" and the "close", and everyone drew in towards
the centre till our little square was as complete as we
could make it in that horrid yellowish-grey fog.</p>
<p>We were just preparing to move on, when there was
a most hideous uproar on our right flank.  People began
firing; there was the noise of hundreds of feet rushing
towards us through the fog, a fearful din of yelling, shrieks
of pain, then the noise of bayonets at work, and I could
feel that the right side of the square was giving ground
and being pressed back, and could hear the strange,
choking, grunting noise men make when they are fighting
hand to hand, and being overcome by numbers.</p>
<p>I had heard it once before with General McNeil's column
in the Soudan, when our zareba had been rushed, and it
was touch and go for a few moments whether we were
entirely wiped out or not.  I was only a newly caught
subaltern in those days, and I shall never forget that
rush.</p>
<p>Old "B.-T." ought to have written about this one, not I.
He would have done justice to it.  I know that I can't.</p>
<p>It all happened in a moment, and we had the yelling
brutes all over us, pushing a thin fringe of struggling
bluejackets in front of them.  They looked huge as they
rushed at us in the fog, but the first two or three who
came my way must have been pretty sorry that I hadn't
forgotten to load my revolver.  It was a regular
pandemonium for about sixty or seventy seconds, I should
fancy.  Ching's men were making a strange, squealing,
hissing sound; the Yankees had a different row; and
our people were grunting and cursing.  I could hear the
Skipper roar: "Close on the centre!" and his bugler
kept on sounding the two "G's" to let us know where
the centre was.  I found myself near him.  He had his
coxswain, and a couple of signalmen, and the two
mids—Ford and Ponsonby—close to him, and was laying about
him with his big stick, and punching fellows in the face
with his fist.  His coxswain knocked over one brute who
was coming for him at the back, and I helped him get
rid of another and then lost touch with him, and came
across the wounded trying to scramble up and defend
themselves with their bayonets, Trevelyan's men standing
over them, clubbing their rifles and making a grand fight
of it.  I saw that they were holding their own, and with a
dozen of my own marines at my back, ran and forced my
way into a lot of fellows who were trying to cut down
Ching's men.  I suppose they hated him and his
jackets even more than they hated us.</p>
<p>My Christopher Columbus! we did give 'em beans, and
I'm precious glad that my sword was the best that could
be bought (well, perhaps bought isn't the right word; so
I will say obtained), for their heads were as tough as iron,
and the wadded cotton coats they wore made it jolly hard
to use the point.  For all that, though, it tickled one or
two of them considerably.</p>
<p>Old Grainger clung to me like my shadow.  He always
seemed to be handy when I'd got two people to manage
at the same time, and we always managed to scoop the pool.</p>
<p>We eased off the pressure round my princess, especially
when Parkinson's First Lieutenant, a man nearly forty,
came along from the left with twenty or so of his people,
shouting, "Rah!—Rah!—Rah!—O!—Ma!—Ha!" and
burst in among them and began clubbing.  Little
Rashleigh suddenly shot into view with a broken sword in
one hand and a revolver in the other.  His scabbard got
between his legs, and he fell sprawling, and would have
been killed if Langham hadn't suddenly sprung out of the
fog and run a chap through who was standing over him
and just going to jab him with a bayonet.</p>
<p>The three machine-gun carriages and the little Chinese
field gun were all rallying places for our people, and I
suppose I must have got into the "focus of disturbance",
as they say about earthquakes, because, although the fog
was so thick, I saw nearly all our officers at one time or
another, and we got so jammed together—Chinese and
marines and bluejackets—that we could hardly move.</p>
<p>I nearly came to grief near that Chinese gun.  A
wretched chap thought he could prod people from beneath
it in comparative comfort, and tried his hand on me, but
wasn't quite quick enough.  He got me a beastly rip in the
leg just above the knee.</p>
<p>Then "Old Lest" seemed to elbow his way along.  If
you'll believe me, he still had a cigar between his teeth
(Whitmore saw it, and his coxswain swears that it was
even then alight).  He had broken his stick over the heads
of two big ruffians, and they bungled against the gun
carriage, and just as I thought that it was my turn to
do something prompt, he caught them by their pigtails
and "wanged" their heads together.  That knocked them
out of time, and his coxswain saw to it that they were dead.</p>
<p>Well, that was my little show, and I felt dizzy, and
Grainger lowered me on to that gun wheel.  The old
sergeant-major came up streaming with blood and loaded
my revolver for me, and Grainger wiped a lot of blood
stuff off my face, which was interrupting the view of the
surrounding scenery.  People seemed to be leaving off
fighting; our fellows were cheering like mad, and the
buglers began sounding the "fall in" and the "cease fire".</p>
<p>I was all right in a second or two, and went back to my
old place in the rear, and my people began limping back,
calling each other and falling in, talking twenty to the
dozen, and wiping their bayonets with tufts of grass.</p>
<p>My sergeant-major got them into something like order
again; there were only twenty-seven on their feet out of
the thirty-nine who had landed, and only about four of
these who had nothing in the way of cuts or stabs to
show for it.</p>
<p>Presently the bugler sounded the "still", and the
coxswain piped, "Officers commanding companies report to
the Captain," and I groped my way across the ground,
simply littered with dead bodies, and found him and
Parkinson.  "Blucher" was sitting behind the Skipper, and
looking extremely ashamed of himself.</p>
<p>Gradually all the officers commanding companies came
up, except "B.-T.", who had a bayonet wound through
his thigh and couldn't walk, and the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> First
Lieutenant, who had been killed just after I had seen him
charging with his men.</p>
<p>Young Jones reported "A" company, and that Withers
was missing; but then someone came up to say that he'd
been found with his head cut open, and quite dead.  Poor
little chap! he was one of the brightest and most
gentlemanly youngsters on board, and I and my marines owed
him a great deal for the way in which he covered our
retreat to the barge two nights ago.</p>
<p>The doctors were singing out to let people know where
they were, and I ran up against old Barclay.  He seemed
to have had a bad time of it himself, but was busy
dressing people and fixing them up.  Old "B.-T." was sitting
with his back to a Maxim carriage wheel, waiting his turn
and holding on to his leg.  He wanted to borrow another
cigarette, but he'd had my last half an hour ago.  I
managed to get one for him, however, and then found
Whitmore.  He'd had one of his thigh bones smashed
by a bullet, and was in great pain.  The whole place was
nothing but a shambles.  The <emphasis>Sparrow's</emphasis> people, who had
borne the brunt of the first attack, had come off worst,
and after them Ching's bluejackets; but you will see by
the list at the end what the actual casualties were.</p>
<p>Ching himself had a slash over the head, but looked
as though he was treading on air, he was so proud and
happy, and I knew that there was a good deal more than
the love of fighting to account for that.</p>
<p>"How's the little lass?" the Skipper said, and I
followed him across to the Chinese gun, and found my poor
little princess bending over it with her head buried in her
hands, and Hobbs sitting on the ground beside her.</p>
<p>The Skipper took her up in his arms and carried her
off to a place where there were not so many dead bodies.
Then happened something which, though disgraceful, is
true.  He was stalking along with her in his arms, and
had just made a long step across a body, when we were
horrified to see the apparently dead Chinaman spring up
and raise a sword above his head to strike the Skipper.
He would have been killed for a certainty, because the
sword was a very heavy one—an executioner's sword—had
not young Ford, who luckily had his revolver in his hand,
placed it against the man's back and shot him.</p>

"THE SKIPPER TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS"</p>
<p>
<emphasis>"THE SKIPPER TOOK HER UP IN HIS ARMS"</emphasis></p>
<p>The Captain turned round and growled out "Umph!"
but took no further notice.  However, the word was
passed round that a wounded Chinaman had attempted
to kill him, and the men were so enraged that they made
certain that there were no more wounded pirates left inside
the square.</p>
<p>This is a fact, whatever you may say about the rights
and wrongs of it.</p>
<p>The Chinese had had enough fighting to last them for
a "month of Sundays", and let us alone after that, and
gave us time to look after the wounded.  The men, of
course, all had their little packets of field dressings with
them, and did a good deal of amateur doctoring, whilst
Barclay, Hibbert of the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, the doctor of the
<emphasis>Omaha</emphasis>, and their stretcher parties looked after the more
seriously wounded.</p>
<p>Then we staggered down to the beach, wading through
the fog with our wounded.</p>
<p>When I say staggered, I mean staggered.  Our people
had been fighting for practically twenty-four hours with
no rest, and they were done to a "turn".  After that
strenuous sixty or seventy seconds' struggle, and the
square had been re-formed, and the wounds had begun
to pain, and arms and legs and bodies to feel stiff,
reaction set in, and if you had seen them walking that last
three hundred yards, you would have thought that most of
them were drunk.</p>
<p>Lucky indeed it was that the Chinese let us alone till
we could get the wounded down on the beach behind a
bank, light several fires to comfort them, and gradually
warmed our fellows up again.</p>
<p>I suppose that if they had charged out of the fog again,
our men would have roused themselves and put up just as
good a fight; but I must say that I felt most extremely
anxious till we had the sea at our backs, and that bank at
the top of the beach with a deep ditch below it in front of us.</p>
<p>We had hoped to find our boats lying off waiting for us,
and tried to attract attention by shouting and firing rifles.
Eventually we heard one of the gunboats begin firing a
gun every half-minute.  It turned out to be the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis>,
and presently she began to make a signal with her fog
siren.  We knew that she was feeling her way in
towards us, by the sound of the blasts coming nearer; but
of course we could see nothing whatsoever through that
maddening nightmare of dirty fog, and out of it came the
moaning blasts of the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> siren with the message:
"Have seen nothing of your boats since this morning.
<emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> boats have been sent down the coast to where
gunboats' brigade originally landed, and have not come
back."</p>
<p>We well knew that that meant a night to be spent on
the bleak shore till the fog should clear away and allow
the boats to find their way to us.</p>
<p>It was then that the tired men were set to work collecting
drift wood and making fires under the bank, whilst
Rashleigh and Trevelyan had to line the bank itself, and
guard our two flanks across the beach.</p>
<p>Although the fires were fairly large ones, they could not
be seen fifteen paces from the far side of the bank.  That
will give you some idea how dense was the fog, so that
we were quite safe in making them, and we brought the
wounded across and settled them as comfortably as
possible.  When I talk about the wounded, I mean, of course,
the badly wounded, men who were obliged to lie or sit
perfectly still; but besides these, nearly everyone was
slightly wounded, but could still handle a rifle.</p>
<p>Trevelyan had brought a tin of tea tabloids—he always
had some dodge up his sleeve—and with the water in our
bottles, we made enough tea to give the wounded and my
poor little princess a hot drink.</p>
<p>Old Grainger "managed" to find another packet of
sandwiches for me, and was very disgusted when I gave
them to Sally.  A strange old chap he was.  I suppose
that I owed my useless life to him half a dozen times
that day, but he would have been offended if I'd even
suggested thanking him.  He had been my servant for
nine solid years, and treated me as if I were a helpless
idiot, and that his whole business in life was to turn me
out on parade a credit to "The Corps".  (I don't mean
to infer that he was the only one who treated me as an
idiot.)</p>
<p>Even during the night, when after a couple of hours'
sleep the marines had to take their turn on top of that
bank, he began bothering me about my clothes.</p>
<p>I had noticed him looking at me as I stood warming
myself in front of a fire, and he began: "Them clothes
won't be no blooming good again, sir, I'm thinkin'.  Two
serges and two pairs of trouses in three blessed nights!
We ain't got enough gear to turn you out proper now, sir."</p>
<p>"That's all right, Grainger; we'll be at Hong-Kong in
a fortnight," I said to cheer him.</p>
<p>"'Ong-Kong!" he sniffed.  "They knows us too well
there, sir.  They wants ready money from us there, sir,
and we ain't got none.  'Ow's your arm, sir?  You never
showed it to the Doctor."</p>
<p>I hadn't, I know; but he wouldn't be satisfied till I had
pulled up my sleeve, and he had found a bandage and
stuck round it, to cover up the two little marks where a
bullet had gone in and out.</p>
<p>It really didn't trouble me much, except to make my
arm stiff.</p>
<p>Then Ford and Rawlings came up to me.  They ought
to have been asleep.  They were like two little cock
sparrows with all their feathers ruffled.</p>
<p>"Would you mind telling us, sir, who captured that
gun?" Rawlings burst out very angrily.</p>
<p>"As far as I remember," I told them, "one of 'B.-T.'s'
people was first; beat you and Whitmore by a short head."</p>
<p>"There!" they both burst out, looking at each other
joyously.  "Do you know, sir, that Mr. Rashleigh says
it's his, and that he captured it?"</p>
<p>"Stuff and nonsense!  That's all my eye!  His people
were nowhere in sight!"</p>
<p>"Well, he's got it, sir, and the <emphasis>Ringdoves</emphasis> dragged it
back, and they say they've got it, and are going to keep it."</p>
<p>"Come and ask Mr. Whitmore," young Ford said; but
I told them that they were not to wake him, and not to be
blithering idiots waking the whole camp.</p>
<p>"Wait till the morning; no one can take it away to-night."</p>
<p>I knew that if it belonged to anyone it belonged to our
Skipper, and that it didn't matter a tuppenny biscuit who
claimed it now, for "Old Lest" would have it in the long
run.</p>
<p>Our two hours' watch passed without any serious trouble,
a few shots occasionally whizzed overhead, that was all,
and before daylight the fog lifted a little, as it had done
the previous day.</p>
<p>As soon as they could see us, the Chinese made a very
half-hearted attack, and the whole brigade had to stand to
arms and line the bank; but we had no difficulty in driving
them off and keeping them at a respectable distance.</p>
<p>As the sun rose the hateful fog swept away altogether,
and it was a most blessed sight to see the sun glittering
on the muddy water, and the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> close to
one another, and only about half a mile from the shore.</p>
<p>Little Sally looked such a forlorn, draggled little woman
in the damp daylight, that I thought she'd be only too glad
for anyone to say something kind to her, so old "B.-T.",
moving in a very "dot-and-go-one" manner, and I went
over to say "how d'ye do" to her and give her a treat.
We were the best-looking fellows in the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, but
old "B.-T.", what with his limp and a forty-eight hours'
beard round his aristocratic chin, wasn't looking his best,
I thought, however, that the bandage round my noble
forehead (to cover up a cut someone had given me) would just
about "fetch" her, and that she would be interested in
about a dozen different specimens of paddy-field mud
which were plastered over me.</p>
<p>However, she "bristled" up when we came along to pay
her homage, and "guessed she didn't want anyone fooling
round her—just yet awhile".  Poor little princess!  She
was so miserable, sitting on the beach behind that bank,
with the Skipper's overcoat buttoned round her.</p>
<p>About an hour after daylight, and the fog had swept
away, our boats managed to find us.</p>
<p>Old "Blucher" had had enough shooting expeditions to
last him till he got home, and jumped into the very first
<emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis> boat that had run up the beach, got under the
thwart in the stern sheets, and never moved till she got
alongside the ship.</p>
<p>The Skipper gave me the job of covering the embarkation,
and it wasn't all "beer and skittles" either, for the
Chinese kept up such a persistent and annoying rifle fire,
that we had to get the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> to shell them
out of some paddy fields and clumps of bamboo trees.
They tried to steal round the beach and cut a few of us off,
and just as we were getting "busy" with them, young
Ford and Rawlings came rushing up again, right in the
middle of everything, and squeaked out that fat little
Rashleigh was taking that wretched Chinese gun aboard
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, that he had actually got it aboard one of his
boats, and was just going to shove off, and that as Whitmore
was on the sick list, and "B.-T." had gone off to the
<emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, couldn't I do something?  They wanted me to go
to the Skipper, or something like that, and tell him that it
really belonged to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"My dear young gentlemen," I told them, when we'd
stopped a bit of a rush, "if you'll be so obliging as to go
out there and ask about five hundred Chinamen, who are
very anxious to obtain specimens of our livers, to cease
firing and stop where they are till we've decided who shall
own their toy cannon, I'll do the best I can to help you.
Tell them that the matter won't admit of delay, and no
doubt they will oblige you."</p>
<p>They looked angry, and rushed away to try and interest
someone else in the important question.</p>
<p>Gradually everyone was withdrawn from the shore, till
there was no one except the Skipper, myself, and my
marines remaining.  We kept the fellows at bay till the
barge came along for us, and then we bolted down to her
and scrambled in, the Skipper being actually the last to
embark.  We had hardly begun to shove off, before the
Chinese had lined the other side of that bank and began
firing at us; but two can play at that game, and we had
another boat and the steam pinnace lying off, to cover our
retreat, and they peppered them pretty severely.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> had come round to meet us, and we got
away out of range all right and alongside her by seven bells
in the afternoon, just in time for afternoon tea.</p>
<p>As soon as I could manage to do so, I slipped away to
Truscott's cabin, and found him much more cheerful.</p>
<p>Old Mayhew had said that he couldn't tell what would
happen till the end of the third day, and this was the
third day since he was wounded, and he had no bad
symptoms.</p>
<p>"To tell the truth, soldier," he whispered, "I'm as
hungry as a hunter; tinned milk and soda water ain't very
filling, and Mayhew won't let me have anything else, and
precious little of that."</p>
<p>I felt pretty well "done up", now that everything was
finished, so Grainger got me a steaming hot bath, and I
turned in and slept till next morning.</p>
<p>Before I went to sleep, Grainger came back looking very
cheerful.  He held up my two damaged pairs of trousers.
"We can do 'em all right, sir; one pair 'as a slit in the
right leg, and the other a split over the left knee.  We'll
'ave a try at taking 'em to pieces, and makin' one good
pair out the two of 'em, sir."</p>
<p>"All right, Grainger; it will be better than having
nothing to wear at all, won't it?" I told him, and went to
sleep.</p>
<p>I copied this list of casualties from somewhere or other,
and think that it is pretty accurate as far as our own
ships and the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> are concerned, though I cannot
guarantee the figures given for the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The "slightly wounded" were those requiring some
treatment, and most of those who were on the sick list
only a few days.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER XVI</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ford saves "Old Lest's" Life</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Vigilant to the Rescue—Rushing the Gun—Ford is
Miserable—The Ringdove Steals the Gun—Ford Bucks
up Again—Mr. Rashleigh and the Gun—The Burial at
Sea—Letters from Home—A Letter from Nan</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>Before I tell you anything else, I must tell you this—it is
the only thing I can think about at present, and has wiped
out all the silly, and idiotic, and bad-tempered things I
have ever done—I have saved Captain Lester's life.</p>
<p>But for me—Dick Ford, a midshipman only just out of
the <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>, a worm, I suppose you would call me—he
would be dead now, and Mrs. Lester and Nan and his
other girls, and all Upton Overy, would be awfully
miserable, and everybody else who had ever known him.</p>
<p>I just look at him when he's striding up and down the
quarterdeck, and think that now, in a way, he belongs just
a little bit to me.  I know that his coxswain, and the
signalman, and any number of others who were near him when
the Chinese broke our square, saved his life a great
number of times; but you have read what Captain Marshall
wrote, and know what happened, and what, by good luck,
I was able to do, so I don't mind in the least sharing
him with all of them, so long as I know that a bit of him
does belong to me.</p>
<p>You see, I knew all the time that I'd really only made
an ass of myself when I was captured, and had my arm
broken, and all that, and that instead of helping him in any
way, I really had only muddled up his plans.  Just before
we began the march back to the coast, Jim and I had
a long yarn about what was best for me to do, and the
only thing he could suggest—you know, of course, that I
only had one arm to use—was for me to keep as close to
the Captain as he would let me, and always have my
revolver handy, in case any Chinese did get near him.  Jim
said that there was always the chance of some chaps trying
to rush us, and it was the only thing he could think of,
and as the Captain only had his big oak stick, and never
thought of danger to himself in the least little bit, I might
make myself useful.  Well, that is why I am so absolutely
happy—I feel now as though nothing can ever make
me feel really miserable again, for long—because if
anything does begin to do so, I just think about Captain Lester,
and that stops it.</p>
<p>When I finished telling you about that awful night in
the walled house, we had heard the sound of the Maxim
gun firing, and knew that the Captain was coming along
to rescue us.  That made us all "buck up" tremendously,
and the fog lifted a little, and it began to grow lighter, and
we could just see the wall and the half-closed gateway, and
some of the dead people lying about, and presently we
heard the sound of firing coming nearer, and began to think
that another half-hour would bring them to us, and that
Sally would then be absolutely safe.</p>
<p>The pirates were not worrying us at all—there had
hardly been a shot for the last two hours—and we guessed
that most of them had gone away to try and stop the
Captain coming.</p>
<p>We even walked about the space inside the walls and
counted the dead bodies—there were forty-seven—and
peeped through the two gateways, and collected some
more Mauser rifles and any amount more ammunition.
We made a fire too, and found some food in the house, and
tried to make Sally eat some breakfast, but she couldn't
touch anything, and went to sleep again.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>
"We even walked about the space inside the walls and counted the dead bodies."</p>
<p>
<emphasis>"We even walked about the space inside the walls and counted the dead bodies."</emphasis></p>
<p>We thought that everything was going on jolly well.
My arm was not nearly so painful—I had had some sleep;
Mr. Ching was very cheerful; Sally and Mr. Hobbs were
both sound asleep; and Miller and the old Scotchman were
coiled up asleep as well.  Martin, the marine—well, I'm not
certain whether I cared much for him—kept on grumbling
about his arm, and reminding me that he wouldn't have
broken it or been taken prisoner but for having tried to
save me.  That rather irritated me after a time.  Mr. Ching
and I were listening to the sound of the firing, and
looking through a window in the direction from which it
came, watching the fog clearing away from the low land
on that side, when all of a sudden there came a roaring
noise out of the fog, and something struck the house close
to us with a crash, and we heard stones falling on to the
ground below.</p>
<p>We ran to where it had struck, and found holes big enough
for me to climb through in both the front and back walls.</p>
<p>Mr. Ching gasped out, "They must have brought up a
field gun;" and we looked, but the fog wasn't thin enough
yet for us to see anything.  He was very frightened, and
ran up to that little square room with the iron shutters,
and came down with Sally in his arms, took her out of the
house and laid her down behind the wall, where it was
very thick.  He was only looking frightened because of
her, I know that, and that he was just like Captain
Lester in never being frightened about himself.  Martin
and Mr. Hobbs came scooting out too.</p>
<p>They kept on firing that gun, and sometimes they hit the
wall and sometimes the house; and presently Miller, who
had woke up, peeped over the wall, and said he could see
the gun, and he lifted me up to look over, and I saw it as
well, under some trees, about five hundred yards away,
along the ridge on which the house was standing.  He
and Mr. Ching and the bluejackets began firing at the
men round it; but they couldn't see it clearly because of
the smoke it made and the fog, and as they didn't really
know how to sight the Mauser rifles properly, they didn't
seem to be able to hit anybody.</p>
<p>At any rate, we couldn't stop it firing, and it was
knocking the house to pieces.</p>
<p>Then a shot struck the top of the wall, and made a gap in
it, and stones went flying round, and one struck a bluejacket
sitting down, not far from where Sally was, still asleep,
struck him on the head, and killed him.  Mr. Ching didn't
know what to do, because he was so worried lest she
should be hurt; and two or three more came along, all
hitting the wall, and it was jolly unsafe to stay anywhere
near it, so we made her go and lie down behind a very
big stone or rock behind the house, and leant some planks
of wood against it to make a kind of roof to keep off
falling stones.</p>
<p>Her father crept under them too.</p>
<p>If the firing became more dangerous, Mr. Ching did
think of lowering her down a shallow well in the garden
under the trees, but that was never wanted.</p>
<p>The rifle and Maxim firing became very heavy, and we
could hear it coming rapidly nearer, and the fog, which
was still lying very dense below the house, now swept
away, and we could see that there were flat paddy fields
there with a small hill on the other side.  It was glorious
to be able to look all round again, and suddenly Chinamen
went flying down our side of that hill opposite, and we
could hear cheering, and then, in a minute or two, some
dark figures, waving their arms over their heads, came on
to the sky line, and we knew that they were our people,
and we all cheered tremendously.</p>
<p>You can have no idea what we all felt like, because,
although we were expecting them, it was quite a different
feeling when we actually saw them.</p>
<p>"Look there, Miller!" I shouted.  "There's a dog there
running backwards and forwards;" and Miller spotted it
too, and I knew that it must be jolly old "Blucher", and
that the Captain must be there.</p>
<p>Mr. Ching asked me if I could signal to them, and I
managed to do so, climbing up to the top of the square
room, and getting out through a hole which the field gun
had made in the roof.  I was so fearfully excited and happy,
that I forgot all about the danger from the gun, and
Mr. Ching helped me up and steadied my feet, and I waved a
long bamboo, and signalled in Morse that we were all well,
but that the gun was doing damage.  I saw some tiny little
flags waving to say that the signalman with the Captain
had read it, and then Mr. Ching pulled me down, and only
just in time, because the field gun made two more holes
close by, almost immediately afterwards.</p>
<p>I was too much excited to worry about the gun in the
least—we all were—and went and watched them over the
wall at the side, and saw some dark figures come racing
down the hill, and presently others whom I knew were
marines came along after them and joined up in the paddy
fields, and I thought I could recognize Mr. Travers and
Captain Marshall by their long legs.  It made me go just a
little hot all over to see Captain Marshall, because I hadn't
forgotten what he had said when I had run away from
the bullets, near those burning huts, and didn't quite want
to see him.</p>
<p>There was a lot more rifle firing and machine-gun firing
farther to the right, and the field gun stopped shooting;
but we couldn't see the marines and those others now,
because they had got across the paddy fields and were
under the brow of our ridge.  We could hear them cheering,
however, though they were out of sight, and the noise
seemed to be going towards the gun, and we knew that
they were charging it, and simply held our breath and
watched Chinamen dodging about, round it, and under
the trees, and firing downhill.</p>
<p>Then they began bolting away out of sight—we knew
what we should see in a moment or two, and held our
breath—and almost directly afterwards a whole crowd
of our people went dashing across the open space, and
swept round the gun.</p>
<p>We all jumped down, made a rush for the gateway,
cheering like mad, and waving, and then I saw someone
jump on top of the field gun and wave his cap, and
knew that it was Jim Rawlings.  I was certain of it, and
Miller said he thought it was too, and this simply added
everything to the joy, because I had been wondering and
worrying whether he was killed or badly wounded—ever
since Miller had told me that he had seen him knocked
down two nights ago, when Mr. Whitmore's party was
retreating, and just before he himself had been captured.</p>
<p>I felt all "bubbly" inside, and didn't quite know what to
do, and felt very "sniffy", and ran towards the gun, with
Miller and Mr. Ching and a lot of his men.  Before we
could get to it, the first lot of our people had gone off after
the Chinese, who were running away; and the next lot of
people I saw was a company of American bluejackets, with
their long thin Captain in front of them.  He gripped my
hand and said he was "right glad to find us alive",
asked after Sally, and rushed on to the house, his old-looking
First Lieutenant shouting out, "Guess things are real
bully," as he followed him.  Then Mr. Rashleigh and the
"Ringdoves" came running up, clustered round the gun,
and began cheering.  Dr. Hibbert gave me a cheery wink,
and Mr. Rashleigh patted me on the back and hurt my
arm, and I hadn't forgiven him for that unfair report of his,
and hated him touching me.</p>
<p>I heard him tell his coxswain to take the gun back to the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and I thought that he couldn't possibly have
known that our people had captured it first; so I told him
about it, and that they had only gone in pursuit of the
Chinese, but he took no notice of me, and I forgot all
about it in the excitement of seeing Captain Lester coming
striding along, puffing and blowing, "Blucher" barking
and prancing ahead of him, running up and smelling the
gun and one or two dead bodies very gingerly.  Then he
spotted me, and came wriggling up to be patted.</p>
<p>The Captain looked very sourly at me and growled out,
"Where's that chap Ching, and the little lass and Hobbs?"
and wanted to know whether Martin and Miller were with
me.  I must have looked a most awful sight, I know,
because I could still only just manage to see out of my left eye
by lifting up the lid with my fingers, and of course I was
covered with mud, and my left sleeve was dangling down,
and my arm was inside my monkey jacket, where the old
Chinaman had bandaged it.  But, for all that, he didn't
even ask me how I was, and that made me miserable.</p>
<p>"Pongo" came panting along after him, and when he
had recovered his breath, I asked if the Commander had
landed with them.</p>
<p>It was then that I heard that he had been shot through the
body, and that Dr. Mayhew didn't know whether he would
live or die.  That made me feel even more wretched, and
the Captain, hearing me ask about him, turned round and
growled: "If you hadn't been such a blamed little idiot,
he'd never have been shot.  Umph!  His little finger is
worth more than all you confounded young midshipmen—umph!—put
together;" and he stalked off to meet the
American Captain.</p>
<p>"Pongo" told me that Dicky was going on all right, and
then wanted to know all about my arm, and my face, and
everything that had happened; but I wanted to be left
alone and be miserable, and went away and hid
somewhere—I didn't care what happened; and wanted to run
away and get killed, or something like that, till I heard
Jim's voice calling for me.  And he found me and comforted
me a little, and said that Dr. Barclay did not think that
the Commander would die, but that Dr. Mayhew wouldn't
say for certain till another day had gone by.  But all the
joy and the excitement had gone out of me, and I felt
wretched and ill, and had a bit of a "weep", and didn't
mind Jim seeing me, not in the least, and he cleared out
and left me, and went away to Mr. Whitmore and presently
came back, and told me all about Mr. Whitmore's party,
and how they'd had a pretty tough job getting back to the
boat, and never got halfway to the gun.  He hadn't been
wounded at all—he didn't even remember falling down—so
Miller must have made a mistake.  He was awfully keen
to see over the house, and went everywhere, and before
I could stop him he poked his nose into the little room
place where they had put Mr. Hoffman and five dead
bluejackets, and that made him feel rather ill.</p>
<p>Everybody seemed to come up after this.  Dr. Barclay
had a look at my arm, and I saw the corners of his mouth go
down.  "'Twill be a long job," he said, and did it up again
as comfortably as he could.  Miller had coiled himself up
behind the wall, and was fast asleep, and so were Mr. Ching
and most of his bluejackets—I would have done anything
in the world for them.  Old Sharpe came up to have a
yarn, and cheered me up a little, and Captain Marshall
caught sight of me, and came along and said something
nice, and I knew that he was sorry, and I was so longing
for someone to be pleasant that I made friends.  He didn't
"hee-haw" either, as I expected he would, when he first
saw my face, and he told me that the Commander knew
that I had sent off that message in the letter which the
Englishman had written, and was pleased about it.  This
cheered me a little.</p>
<p>But the Captain took no notice of me, and every time he
passed, my heart just felt like lead inside me, and
everyone seemed to know that I was in disgrace, even old
"Blucher".</p>
<p>It seems silly to say so, but I did fancy that he was not
so affectionate as he usually was, and it hurt me.</p>
<p>Then they brought a dead man along with his face
covered up, and someone told me that it was Wilkins,
the marine bugler, who had helped me to set fire to
one of those huts, and throw stones at the dogs, and
that made me sadder than ever again.</p>
<p>Both of the landing parties must have managed to
slip through in the fog without really running up against
many of the Chinese; but now they were swarming all
round us, and there was so much to do to keep them
off, that I was left alone, and got into a safe corner,
and watched the ships firing at the town and the
six-inch gun.  Sally had been put in a safe place, so the
Captain didn't care in the least where their shells went;
and a good many did come pretty close to us, and one
of the <emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis> eight-inch shells didn't burst, and came
roaring overhead, and fell into the paddy fields below.</p>
<p>Presently a number of houses in the town caught fire,
and a lot of the Chinese ran away to try and put the
fires out, so that we were not so much worried with them.</p>
<p>I wasn't there when the mandarin came to see the
Captain, and didn't hear that he had brought the Englishman's
head with him till afterwards, and by that time so
many sad things had happened, that I did not feel so very
sorry for him.</p>
<p>Then we began our retreat, and it was just before we
started that Jim suggested that as I only had one arm, the
best thing that I could do was to stick quite close to the
Captain.  He offered me his revolver, but I still had that
one the Englishman had given me, and a good many
cartridges for it were still in my pocket, so I got him to load
it for me.  He said a lot of things to buck me up before
he went away, and I tried to feel happier, but it wasn't
much of a success, at any rate whilst I was near the
Captain.  You see, he didn't even notice me.  I thought that
perhaps he would send me away from him, but not noticing
me hurt me almost more, and I didn't want to talk to
"Pongo", because he was nearly as much an idiot as
"Dicky", and though he tried to buck me "up", he only
made me want to kick him.  He would keep going at it,
too, and I was jolly glad whenever he had to run on a
message for the Captain, and left me alone.</p>
<p>I saw Captain Marshall and Mr. Travers rush the hill
opposite us, and then we had to follow them across the
paddy fields, very slowly, because we had eight wounded
men to carry.  Eight men from the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> dragged that
Chinese gun along behind us, and Jim came up when we
were halfway across.  He had caught sight of the gun,
and was simply furious, because it wasn't their gun at
all, and we both told Mr. Trevelyan so, and he was just
as angry.</p>
<p>"Have you said anything to the Gunnery Lieutenant?"
he asked.</p>
<p>Jim had told him, but he wasn't going to do anything.
He thought that the Captain had probably given Mr. Rashleigh
permission, so wasn't going to be mixed up with it,
and we couldn't speak to the Captain himself.</p>
<p>We got across all right, but Captain Parkinson lost a
lot of people in the rearguard when he left the walled
house, and that meant more wounded for us to carry,
and then we dragged on again, and Mr. Travers and
Captain Marshall had a fearful time when they tried to
leave their hill.  They did it splendidly, and it was grand
to see their men walking backwards down the hill, with
their bayonets all sticking out at the brutes above them,
and when they ran back, Mr. Travers and Captain
Marshall and two or three men had to stop and keep the
Chinese from killing a wounded man who had fallen
almost in front of their feet—they were so close behind
them.  We saw Mr. Langham rush back from the
Maxim gun and pick him up and carry him along,
whilst the others kept the Chinese off, and we all
cheered.  It was a grand sight, and it washed out a
lot of silly things Mr. Langham had done to us in the
gunroom.</p>
<p>After that we had seventeen people to carry, which
meant very slow work, and then the Captain took charge
of the rearguard, because it was the most dangerous
place, and I kept close to him and saw that my
revolver was all right; but nothing much happened, and
we cleared out back to within half a mile of the shore,
where that beastly fog began.</p>
<p>I never even saw Sally all this time, because Mr. Ching's
bluejackets stood in a ring all round her, touching
shoulders, so that none of the bullets that were
always coming along should touch her.  I did see her
skirt once when we were halted, and she was sitting
on the ground in the middle of them; but that was all.</p>
<p>We all joined up together then, and went as fast as
we could, and the fog rolled all over us and shut out
everything.  It was perfectly awful, and we seemed to
lose each other and then find each other again, time
after time, and there were all our people shouting, and
trying to form a square all round us, and farther away
in the fog Chinamen were yelling and gradually getting
round our flanks, and at last they were even ahead
of us.</p>
<p>It was then, that the Captain spoke to me for the
first time, and ordered me to try and find Captain
Parkinson, and tell him to close his men on the centre, so
as not to have too broad a front, and to go very slowly.
I did manage to find him, after stumbling into a ditch
and hurting my left arm, and very nearly losing my
revolver, and was only able to get back to the Captain
because his bugler kept on sounding "G's".</p>
<p>Just being taken notice of bucked me up again very
much, and when the Chinese suddenly rushed against
our square, making a most awful noise, I wasn't really
frightened—I didn't want to live unless I could do
something to wipe out everything that I had done wrong—and
this was my chance, I thought.  I was shoved about
from side to side, and jammed in among a lot of our
men, and was so small, that the brutes perhaps didn't
see me, and somehow or other I managed to keep near
the Captain, and his coxswain, and the signalman, and
I think I helped them keep the Chinese off him.  I know
that my revolver was empty when the fighting left off, and
I had tried very carefully not to fire except when a
Chinaman was almost touching.  I had been knocked over by
our own men just before the finish, and lost the Captain,
but found him again, and got one of the signalmen to
reload the revolver.</p>
<p>I have often been asked whether I was frightened, and
people think that I am only putting on "side" when I
tell them I was not.  But I wasn't, not in the least,
because, as you must understand by now, from all I
have written, I was too frightfully miserable and too
ashamed of myself.</p>
<p>Well, you know what happened, and that I managed
to kill a brute who pretended to be dead and tried to
kill the Captain, as he was carrying Sally away from
those dead bodies round the Chinese gun.</p>
<p>The Captain did not say anything about it at the time,
but that didn't stop me being happy in the least.  I didn't
want thanks, I was simply satisfied to have done it—all
by myself, too—with lots of people looking on, so that
there could not be any mistake about it.  Jim soon heard
about it, and found me, and gave my good arm a squeeze
and went off.  I had heard Captain Marshall "hee-hawing"
about Ching looking as if he was walking on "air",
and I didn't know what he meant at the time; but now
I knew, for I felt that I was walking on air too, and
forgot my arm and my face and of being so tired—forgot
everything except having saved the Captain—and I'm
certain that Mr. Ching could not have felt more happy
than I did.</p>
<p>I still stuck to the Captain, although he didn't say
anything to me, and even when I heard that Withers
had been killed, I couldn't feel as sad as I ought, though
he was really a chum of mine.</p>
<p>Presently, when all the terrible number of wounded had
been patched up, we brought them and the dead down to
the sea, and when we got that signal out of the fog from
the <emphasis>Omaha's</emphasis> siren, we settled down to spend the night on
the shore, behind a damp bank, and made some fires, and
tried to make the wounded comfortable round them.  When
the Captain had seen to everything, he went over to one
of the fires and sat down to light a cigar, as he had run
out of matches.  I think that he must have been a little
tired.</p>
<p>I sat down behind him, with "Pongo" and "Blucher",
and presently he turned round—he could see my face by the
light of the fire, and I was trembling all over for him to
say something—and he growled out, "Haven't improved
the look of your face, Dick!"</p>
<p>Well, I simply ran down towards the sea and hid in the
fog, and sat down in the mud and cried for joy.  No one
else could see me, and I didn't much care if they did, for
I felt too happy to describe it to you.  I knew that
everything was wiped out at last.</p>
<p>Of course he never cared a little bit about himself, so
probably never thought it was such a splendid thing to
save his life, or worth the trouble of thanking me for
doing so.  That is why he hadn't done it, in so many
words; but just that "They haven't improved the look
of your face, Dick!" was all I wanted, and I was too shy
to go back for a long time, till I got so cold that I had
to, and found Jim there and told him, and he squeezed
my arm again, and I know that he was as happy as I
was.  He hadn't got hurt all day, not even in the fight
in the square.  He'd been knocked under a Maxim
carriage whilst he was trying to help Mr. Whitmore
get into some safe place, after his leg had been broken,
and had nothing but a few bruises to show.  He really
was rather worried about having nothing else to show
for it.</p>
<p>He was still bubbling over with anger about that gun.
He disliked Mr. Rashleigh even more than I did, and he
hated him having it.  We couldn't do anything, although
Captain Marshall said that he had no right to it whatsoever.
Mr. Travers, with his leg jolly painful, didn't want
to be worried about anything, and Captain Parkinson was
too sad about his First Lieutenant having been killed to
think of anything else.  He did say, "Guess your marines
had gone by when my boys came up, and that little fat
chap was behind me—some."</p>
<p>"I actually stood on it, sir!  Didn't you see me,
Dick?"  Jim told him, and I told Captain Parkinson that I had
seen him, too, from the gateway with my own eyes,
and that was a long time before anyone else came in sight.</p>
<p>He wouldn't say anything, so we went away and sat
down close to the Captain, and began talking about
it—you know what I mean—talking just loudly enough for
him to hear, if he wanted to; but we were both too
frightened to talk too loudly, and I don't think that he
did hear.</p>
<p>It was grand to see the fog rolling away in the morning,
and to see the gunboats showing up, and when it cleared
away altogether, it was grander still to watch them
peppering the Chinese with shells whenever they came out in
the open.  Then the boats came along, and you should
have seen old "Blucher" scrambling into the first
<emphasis>Vigilant's</emphasis> boat that ran up the beach.  It made everyone
laugh.</p>
<p>I was sent back with the second batch of wounded, and
Dicky met me at the gang-way, looking awfully white and
scared.  He told me that the Commander was doing all
right; but I wasn't allowed to see him, and Dr. Mayhew
was almost off his head with worry and work, and hadn't
time to talk to me.</p>
<p>When I saw my face in the looking-glass I didn't wonder
why people had smiled whenever they saw me.  The left
side was all purple and black, and my forehead was raw,
and my left eye and upper lip all swollen.</p>
<p>Old Ah Man burst into tears, when he saw me—he was
a funny old chap—and went away and kicked his Chinese
stewards and "makee learn" boys, and brought me some
beef tea and custard, and cried again when he heard that
Withers had been killed.</p>
<p>Then I had a hot bath, Dicky helping me, and turned
into my hammock, and it wasn't till next morning that my
arm was properly dressed and put into plaster of Paris.</p>
<p>I knew, even before I went on deck, by the noise of the
bell being struck every two minutes, that the fog had come
on again.  It was denser than ever, if that was possible,
and we had to switch on the lights all over the ship to see
our way about.</p>
<p>At midday we buried Withers and the five men belonging
to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> who had been killed—buried them
overboard.  Captain Lester had brought them off from
shore, because he feared that if he buried them there
the Chinese would dig them up and mutilate them.</p>
<p>It was most awfully solemn and depressing, in that
damp, raw fog, with our bells tolling and our colours
half-masted and dripping down limply.  Out of the fog,
on each side of us, the gunboats' bells were tolling, for
they were burying their dead too, and the noise seemed
to throb right through you.  The Chaplain read the
funeral service over the six bodies, covered with Union
Jacks, and lying in a row on the quarterdeck, Withers
being the smallest and being placed farthest aft, because
he was an officer, and the Captain stood behind them,
without moving a muscle, and looking terribly stern.</p>
<p>The marines fired three volleys, and "A" and "B"
companies fired another three volleys, and then the two
bluejacket buglers sounded the "Last Post" six times,
and each time, as the last note died away, there was a
splash, and I felt as if something icy cold had struck
me right in the middle of the back.</p>
<p>I did not dare to look at anyone except the Captain.
Then the band played a cheerful march, Mr. Lawrence
sang out—"Ship's company!  Right and left turn!  Quick
march!" and the men marched for'ard into the battery,
very silently, looking over the side at the water as they
went through the battery screen door.</p>
<p>"Hoist the colours!" the Captain said, and went below.
His lips were very tightly squeezed together.  No one could
eat any lunch, we were all so miserable, and no one even
heard Captain Marshall "hee-hawing" for a long time—not
for days and days.</p>
<p>But the Commander's third day had gone by, and
Dr. Mayhew and Dr. Barclay, both of them, said that he
would get well, and that cheered us all; and in a couple
of days or so the Captain began to get angry again,
and to grunt and growl at everybody, which was another
good sign, and cheered us up a great deal.  He was
fearfully angry about the fog; for it settled down and
never lifted for four days, and was so thick that we could
do nothing all that time, and of course the Captain had
only half finished his job, and wanted to burn the town
and the junks and recapture the yacht.</p>
<p>It did lift on the fifth day, and when the gunboats
stood inshore and the Captain landed, with everyone who
was well enough to land, there was no one there to
oppose him, and only about twenty small junks still
remaining in the creek.  The pirates had simply cleared out
in all the big junks and escaped in the fog, and before
they left they had set fire to the yacht and the tramp
steamer, and these were simply complete wrecks.  Jim
told me that they were nothing but bent and warped iron.</p>
<p>The Captain was in a terrible rage about it; but I don't
see how he could blame himself, and it was only lucky
that the fog had lifted during the morning on which we
had all got off.</p>
<p>He burnt the rest of the town and destroyed the six-inch
gun; and the Chaplain went ashore, with a firing party, and
read the funeral service over the graves of Mr. Hoffman
and Wilkins, the marine bugler, and fired three volleys,
and the bluejacket drummer-boy used Wilkins's own bugle
to sound the "Last Post".  When this was done, and
when the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> had towed away some of the junks
and burnt the others, we all steamed back to Tinghai.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> was sent up to Shanghai to communicate
with the Admiral, and took with her our mails.  I wrote
a most gorgeous letter to my mother, and you can
imagine what tremendously exciting letters we all had
to write home.</p>
<p>Jim was in charge of the boat that took the mail bags
across to her, and he came back red with anger.  "They've
got that gun all burnished and polished, just abaft the
mainmast—I saw it;" and that made us all, everyone in
the gunroom, angry again.  We had almost forgotten
about it in the excitement of getting back to Tinghai
and writing home.</p>
<p>Sally and Mr. Hobbs went in her, but before they went
Mr. Langham coaxed her down into the gunroom to cut
those ribbons across the piano.  She was very nervous and
uncomfortable, and just as she was going to do it with
Webster's dirk, someone suggested that Withers's ought
to be used, so we went away and fetched it from his chest.
When she knew whose it was she cried, and we all felt
horribly "snuffy", and then she opened the piano and sat
down, but only touched one note and burst into tears
again.  Mr. Langham pulled out his big handkerchief,
shoved it into her hands, and she ran away.</p>
<p>Directly she had disappeared Mr. Langham locked the
piano and threw the key through the scuttle into the sea.</p>
<p>When the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> came back she brought six weeks'
mails, and that was the first thing that really cheered us
up.  We were quite happy.</p>
<p>I had six long letters from my mother, the first I had
had since leaving home, and I sat on my chest in a corner
by myself and read them, and it was very jolly to hear
all that had happened at home; but they made me miserable,
for although she tried to write cheerfully, I knew
that she was really very worried.  You see, my father
would put all the little money he had into silly swindly
things which he saw advertised in the papers, and my
mother often told me that some of the religious papers
had more swindling advertisements in them than ordinary
daily papers, and of course my father, being a parson, often
saw these.  I don't know much about it, but she used to
tell me that if he saw an advertisement telling anyone to
send, say, five pounds to a man and he would be sure
to make it into ten or twenty pounds in a week—by some
certain plan he had invented for dealing in stocks and
shares—my father would nearly always do it, if he could
manage to scrape any money together.</p>
<p>I know that my mother often cried about it, and I've
often heard him say, "Well, my dear, they seem to know
what they are talking about.  They can't be all swindlers,
or else the editors wouldn't print their advertisements, so
I'll just try, this once."</p>
<p>He always lost his money, and I know, for a fact, that
my mother only had one new dress all the time I was on
the <emphasis>Britannia</emphasis>, so as to have enough money to pay for me
there.</p>
<p>I know that this is rather a "sniffy" chapter, but I can t
help it, and I'm telling you just what happened, and how
I felt about everything.</p>
<p>The Captain sent for me before I had read my letters
more than twice, and I shoved them into my chest and
ran aft to his cabin.</p>
<p>He was sitting at his knee-hole table in his shirt sleeves,
smoking a cigar, with heaps of letters all around him, and
"Blucher's" head close to his elbow.</p>
<p>"Good news from home, I hope, Ford?  Here's something
for you from my girl Nan," and he gave me a folded-up
piece of notepaper with "Dick" scrawled across it.</p>
<p>I was running out again when he gurgled: "Arm all
right?  Let me see you move your fingers.  Umph.
You'll be all right.  Umph!  I wrote to the missus to
tell her you'd shot that chap who tried to cut me down;
wrote to your mother too, to tell her you were going
on well—told her about it as well.  Umph!"</p>
<p>"Did you really, sir?" I gasped.  "Thank you very
much indeed, sir!"</p>
<p>"Umph!  Do you know where we are going?
Yokohama!—to-morrow; got orders to-night; off you go."</p>
<p>I rushed off to tell everybody, and was awfully happy
again—everyone was; but what made me so happy was
to know that Captain Lester himself had written about
me saving his life, and that everyone at Upton Overy
would know about it.  I knew how my mother would love
her letter, and keep it, and read it over and over again.
Nan wrote an awfully spidery kind of a fist, and wanted
me to bring her a whole lot of "curios" when we came
home.  She said that I had promised to do so, and that
this was just a "reminder".  It was jolly to hear from her,
and she sent her love to old "Blucher", and wanted to
know whether he had had any of his "fits" lately.</p>
<p>My face was nearly all right again by this time, but the
forehead was darker on the left side, and Dr. Barclay said
that he thought it would always be like that.</p>
<p>I didn't really mind, because it would always be something
to show, and to remind me of everything.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I was rather pleased about it, but
had to pretend I wasn't.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER XVII</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goodbye to the Huan Min</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Out of Danger—Goodbye to Ching—Mr. Rashleigh's
Report—at Hong-Kong</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Commander Truscott</emphasis></p>
<p>I thank God that I am not lying under the muddy water
rolling round the Hector Group, with Withers and those
other poor fellows of ours.</p>
<p>It was to Marshall and his marines that I owe my
life, and I wish that it was in my power to repay them.
In attempting to rescue young Ford that night he was
captured, I had been shot clean through the body, below
the left ribs, and two of the marines—I do not know
which two, and they have never come forward to tell
me—carried me back to the walls of that battery, whilst
Marshall kept the Chinese at bay.  It was Barclay who
told them to carry me as gently and smoothly as possible,
as this was my only chance, and they carried me as if
I had been a baby asleep, although the Chinese were
closing all around them.  They got me down the mud
shore, and into the barge, only just in time, and it was
whilst I was being lifted in that Marshall received the
blow on the head which knocked him over.  There was
a most desperate fight to save him, and then poor young
Withers managed to drive them off with his gun.</p>
<p>When they got me aboard the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, Mayhew would
not give me any opinion as to what my chances were.
"Look here, Mayhew!" I told him, "I'm not a baby; tell
me;" but he only said, "Wait for three days, and eat
nothing till then.  I cannot tell you before."</p>
<p>I had to be content with that, and to lie in my bunk,
with the pictures of my wife and my two boys smiling at
me out of their frames, and watch the hands of the little
clock she had given me crawling round its face, and
wondering, whenever I had a twinge of pain inside me,
whether the trouble which Mayhew feared had commenced,
and whether the end was near.</p>
<p>Mayhew used to come to my cabin half a dozen times
a day, feel my pulse, and take my temperature.  "Hungry
still, Commander?" he would say, and smile and go away,
and each time I would watch his face to see if the smile
was only there to cover his real feelings.  No one who has
not been through a time like this can imagine how awful
is the suspense.</p>
<p>On the morning after the Skipper had come back with
the landing parties, bringing Sally, her father, young
Ford, and our missing men with him, Mayhew found
my temperature and pulse normal.  He gave a whoop.
"You'll live to enjoy your pension all right, Truscott,"
and told me that I was practically out of danger.  Barclay
came in and confirmed his opinion.  I lay back, too filled
with emotion to speak.  Those photographs seemed to
smile even more at me—they represented all I had to
live for—and life seemed very good.</p>
<p>Neither of the doctors had had any sleep during the
night, as they had been busy with the wounded, and
Barclay looked pretty ghastly.  He had had a blow on
the head during the fight in that square, but fortunately
the sword edge had been turned by his cap.</p>
<p>The Captain came in almost immediately afterwards,
growling very fiercely to hide his feelings.  "Umph!  I've
kept back the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> till I heard about you from
Mayhew this morning.  Going to send her up to Shanghai
at once.  I'll be off and write a letter to your missus.
Umph!  You want shaving—badly;" and he gripped my
hand and went out again.</p>
<p>I finished my letter home—as you can imagine I finished
it—the sentry outside was waiting for it, I heard the
boat shove off to take it to the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, and I thanked
God once more and felt inexpressibly at peace.</p>
<p>At the same time that she heard the news of my wound,
my wife would hear that I was out of danger, and this,
too, caused me to be very thankful.</p>
<p>Some little time afterwards the curtain was pushed aside,
and young Ford's extremely disfigured face peeped through.
I smiled at him, and he gave me a frightened cheerful smile
and drew it back again.</p>
<p>Poor little chap! he'd been pretty badly knocked about.
I ought never to have let him go on that "fool" errand
of his.  But he was as happy as a lord, because he had
saved the Skipper's life.</p>
<p>In a week's time I was allowed to sit up for an hour
or two a day, and in ten days' time to walk about a
little.</p>
<p>Then the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> arrived with six weeks' mails, and
orders from the Admiral to proceed at once to Yokohama
with the gunboats, to land all the wounded still requiring
hospital treatment, and to join the flagship somewhere
off the coast of Corea.  We were to proceed with
"despatch", as political complications in Europe threatened
war with a country which maintained a considerable fleet
in Chinese waters.</p>
<p>The Captain of the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> had received orders by
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> as well, and had to continue the search
for the remainder of the pirates—those who had escaped
in the junks.</p>
<p>Ching and his Captain dined with our Skipper that
night, and, for him, "Old Lest" was extraordinarily
gentle.  He felt, I am sure, that he was leaving them
in the lurch, with all this work still in front of them,
and thought it was hardly "playing the game", after
the magnificent way in which they had helped us.</p>
<p>I heard him tell Ching: "Umph!  But for you, Ching,
we should never have done it, never have rescued the little
lass" (I saw Ching wince), "and everyone would have called
'Old Lest' a silly old fool.  I only wish that we could
stay and help you; but we can't.  There's trouble comin'
along, and the Admiral wants every ship he can get hold
of, so we've got to be off."  He grunted and growled a few
times, and then burst out fiercely with, "'Old Lest' will
never forget you."</p>
<p>He gave Ching a photograph of himself, and a silver
cup he had won years ago as a midshipman.  It was
the Admiral's cup for the Channel Fleet in the old days,
and he valued it more than anything else he had in his
cabin.  I told Ching so afterwards, in order that he should
appreciate it all the more.</p>
<p>He had written to the Foreign Office as well, about
Ching, and we all hoped that eventually he would get
his promotion.</p>
<p>To continue the search for the fugitive and scattered
pirates was like hunting for the button in a Christmas
pudding after the thimble and sixpence had been found—a
good deal of trouble, and not worth the bother
when you did find it.</p>
<p>Little Sally was the thimble, and the yacht and the
tramp steamer the sixpence, and we all knew well
enough that Ching wanted the thimble, and didn't care
in the least for anything else.</p>
<p>He had told me that he was hoping to be sent back
to Shanghai, and I know that he wanted another chance
of seeing Sally, and that the prospect of cruising alone
among those bleak, fog-bound islands, now that she had
been rescued and had gone out of his life, was very dreary
to him.</p>
<p>Before he went back to his antiquated old tub, he
was taken into the ward room, where they gave him
a great "send-off".  Everyone knew that but for him
Sally would not have been rescued, everyone on board
admired his pluck and gallantry, and everyone was
extremely sorry to part with him.</p>
<p>At daybreak next morning the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> got up her
clumsy anchor and steamed away, and we all manned
ships and cheered her as she passed us, and waited on
deck till she had disappeared round the island, out of
sight, and nothing of her remained but a dense cloud
of oily black smoke.</p>
<p>"Umph!  There goes a confounded fine chap", the
Skipper growled, as he went below.  We ourselves, with
our gunboats, left shortly afterwards for Yokohama, and
Parkinson in the <emphasis>Omaha</emphasis> came along too.  There are
small English and United States naval hospitals still
kept up in this Japanese town, and all the bad cases
were sent ashore to them.</p>
<p>Parkinson, after having landed his, left for Chemulpo in
Corea, and we gave him and his officers a great farewell
dinner to commemorate the termination of the expedition.</p>
<p>I did not take part in this, however, because Mayhew
forced me to go to hospital with Whitmore, Ford, and
seven others of our men.</p>
<p>I was very loath to go, because I felt as fit as a fiddle,
and war troubles were brewing, and my place ought to be
on board.  However much I dreaded a big naval war,
there was always the chance of some promotion, and I
hated to be left behind.</p>
<p>However, Mayhew wouldn't hear of my coming, and we
had to watch the old <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> steam away past the
breakwater without us.</p>
<p>I rather fancy that the doctors were a little too careful
about me, for, as a matter of fact, I never felt better in my
life.</p>
<p>Before the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> sailed, the Skipper brought "Blucher"
up to the hospital to say goodbye to us, and told me many
things.  One was that he had allowed the old Scotch
engineer, whom we had brought with us from the island,
to go ashore and disappear.</p>
<p>"Umph!" the Skipper growled.  "Had enough evidence
to hang him a dozen times; but he helped our
people in that house, and Ford and those two fellows
would have been scuppered but for him, so I sent him
ashore at night, gave him a ten-pound note, and told
him to clear."</p>
<p>The ten-pound note was out of his own pocket, I knew
well enough.</p>
<p>He was asking my opinion as to whom he should mention
by name in his despatches, and, just as he was going,
said, "Umph!  Truscott, I sent that Report of Proceedings
back to Rashleigh with a copy of Trevelyan's and
young Ford's.  Told him to rewrite his.  Told him that
I wouldn't forward it to the Admiral till I was satisfied
with it, and he's written quite a different yarn.  Umph!
I told him what I thought of him—pretty plainly."</p>
<p>Young Ford had been bothering me, time after time, to
do something about that Chinese gun which Whitmore,
Travers, and Marshall had captured, and which
Rashleigh had claimed and kept.  From all that I had
gathered, especially from Whitmore, there was no doubt
that Rashleigh had no earthly right to it.  I took this
opportunity of mentioning the subject.</p>
<p>"Umph!  I know the fat little beggar's got no right to
it.  Thought he had when he asked me for it, so gave it
him, and let him take it away; but when 'Old Lest's'
given anything away—umph!—he don't go back on his
word.  It belongs to me, I suppose, and I can do what
I like with it, eh?"</p>
<p>After he had gone I let Ford know what he had said
about that Report, and he was extremely delighted; but the
possession of that gun still rankled very deeply, and I felt
sure that he would not be content whilst it remained aboard
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>.</p>
<p>From a few things Ford said, more or less under his
breath, I had a dim suspicion that if it wasn't handed
over to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, the gunroom meant to do something
or other.</p>
<p>"What's the game?" I asked him; but he wasn't going
to give away any secrets.</p>
<p>For four weeks we were left to ourselves, and young
Ford and myself were able to have many pleasant little
excursions up country, and each day's excitement was
the arrival of Reuter's telegram at the English Club on
the Bund, with news of the gathering war clouds.</p>
<p>As war seemed to be becoming imminent, both of us
felt our position very keenly.  Poor Whitmore with his
smashed thigh was, of course, totally helpless, but, as
I said before, I was as strong as a horse again, and
Ford's arm did not entirely incapacitate him.</p>
<p>Just, however, as we thought that war was only a question
of hours, the war clouds disappeared, to our intense
relief, and presently the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> came back to pick us all
up again, the Skipper having orders to proceed to Singapore,
and to act as Senior Officer there till it was time for
us to go home and pay off.</p>
<p>I was fit for duty now, even Mayhew couldn't deny that,
and right glad I was to get back to my work and to my
own bunk.</p>
<p>We called in at Nagasaki for coal, took in four hundred
tons, and then left for Hong-Kong, where we arrived in
the middle of June, just before the hot weather had
commenced, and made fast to one of the buoys off Murray
Pier.</p>
<p>It was very pleasant being back there, and we were
obliged to remain for a whole week, whilst the
dockyard made a few slight repairs.</p>
<p>The only other man-of-war in the harbour besides the
<emphasis>Tamar</emphasis> and the old <emphasis>Wyvern</emphasis>, moored off Kowloon, was
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, secured to another buoy farther inshore.</p>
<p>Young Ford can tell you better what happened there
during that week than I can.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I am not supposed to know anything
about it, and don't <emphasis>officially</emphasis>.</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER XVIII</strong></p>
<p><strong>A Midnight Adventure</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sent to Hospital—The Subscription—The Sub's Plan—An
Exciting Moment—Mr. Rashleigh Rages—Jim is Safe</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>I was very sorry indeed to say goodbye to Mr. Ching—we
all were—and, of course, I had had such a lot to do
with him in that walled house, that I ought to have
been more sorry than anyone else.</p>
<p>The day before we separated from the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>,
Mr. Lawrence and I went aboard her and had lunch
with him.  It was a funny kind of meal, and with only
one hand I couldn't help myself very well, so Mr. Ching
cut my food up into little pieces, and sent for a pair of
chopsticks.  If you have ever tried chopsticks, you will
know that the first time you try them you cannot do
much, and I could hardly pick up anything at all, and
didn't do more than taste anything before the others had
finished theirs, and my plate was taken away.</p>
<p>They thought it was jolly amusing to watch me, and
though I was as hungry as a hunter, I had to pretend
that I wasn't, and that I didn't mind.  There were all
sorts of curious things there, and I had so wanted to
eat them all.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Ching began yarning
about old times when they were midshipmen together in
the <emphasis>Inflexible</emphasis> years and years ago, so they didn't want
me, and I slipped away and went round the ship, and
when I saw any man who had been in the walled house
that awful night, I shook him by the hand, because I
was so glad to see him again.</p>
<p>I think they liked me doing it, and they all grinned and
saluted very smartly.</p>
<p>Mr. Ching gave me one of the gold-lace dragons from
the sleeve of one of his uniform coats.  I wanted that
more than anything, and still have it, and I gave him
my stamp album.  It only had a few stamps stuck in
here and there, but there was a dark-red English penny
stamp which, I believe, was rather valuable, and I had
nothing else worth giving away.  He seemed very pleased
with it, and made me stick my name in it, so that he could
remember me.  I did hope that he would.</p>
<p>Mr. Hobbs and Sally had not given him anything at all.
Wasn't that nasty of them, after all he had done?  But
he still kept that tam-o'-shanter she had worn; I saw it in
his cabin.</p>
<p>Then the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis> went off, to carry on hunting for
pirates by herself, and we went up to Yokohama, and
when we arrived, the Commander, Mr. Whitmore, myself,
and seven of our men were sent to hospital.</p>
<p>I rather liked going, because it was so uncomfortable on
board, with only one useful arm; but then we heard that
there might be a war, and it was perfectly horrid to see
the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> steaming away without us.</p>
<p>Still, I Was jolly happy, because, after she had gone, the
Commander told me all that the Captain had said about
Mr. Rashleigh and his Report of Proceedings.  That
didn't square up everything, not by a long chalk.  We
wanted that gun, and we were going to have it, too,
and before I'd been sent to hospital, Mr. Langham and
everyone else in the gunroom had sworn to get it back,
and had begun inventing plans for doing so.</p>
<p>Then three weeks went by, my arm had been put in
plaster again, and back the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> came.  There wasn't
to be any war, and she took us all down to Hong-Kong,
and we found the old <emphasis>Tyne</emphasis> there, which made me think
of the first time I had seen her, and of how miserable
and happy, in turns, I had been on board her.</p>
<p>But just ahead of the <emphasis>Tamar</emphasis> was the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, quite
close to where we made fast to one of the outer buoys, and
when she was swung by the tide in one position, we could
see that Chinese gun just at the foot of her main mast.</p>
<p>That made us all "bristle" up again and get most
frightfully angry.  We had almost forgotten all about
it in the excitement of knowing that we were going
south to Singapore, to wait for our relief ship to come
out from England, and then go home to pay off.</p>
<p>At dinner that night we were as hot about it as ever,
and we made up our minds again to get it, somehow
or other.  It was jolly difficult to know how we could
manage it, and nobody seemed to have any good schemes
to suggest.  Webster's idea was to run alongside during
the dinner hour, when probably only the quartermaster
would be awake, but that was silly.  We couldn't
possibly do it in the daytime, and we couldn't even think
of a plan for doing it at night without being discovered.
We knew jolly well that if we were found out, there
would be a most awful fuss, and we should get into
hot water with the Captain.</p>
<p>We made such a jolly row, all shouting and suggesting
things, and calling each other silly idiots, that Mr. Langham
stuck his fork into a beam overhead.</p>
<p>That is a signal for all the midshipmen and cadets to
clear out of the gunroom, and as the last "out" always
had his "extra" bill stopped for three days, so could not
get any sardines or pickles from Ah Man, we were all out
in a jiffy, and left Mr. Langham, Mr. Hamilton the big
Engineer Sub, and the "A.P." to work out a scheme
between them.</p>
<p>They wouldn't let us come back again, and I know that
they didn't decide upon anything; but during the middle
watch that night something happened which showed us
the way.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Langham's "watch", and at about five
bells there suddenly had been a lot of shouting under
the bows, and he, the quartermaster, and the signalman
had all run for'ard to see what was the matter, and found
that a junk had fouled the buoy, drifted down against our
bows, and carried away a mast.</p>
<p>They got her clear, but it took a quarter of an hour to
do it, and, of course, during that time there had been no
one aft at all, and anything might have happened there
without anyone knowing of it.</p>
<p>Now, don't you see what the idea was?</p>
<p>Mr. Langham didn't tell us what he was going to do
exactly, for fear that we should be asses enough to talk
about it to everyone, and that the "Ringdoves" would
hear about it as well; but he went aboard the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>
in the morning to see the navigator, who was a pal of his
(except for the "gun question"), and came back again
very excitedly.</p>
<p>"I had a good look at that gun, you chaps, without
pretending to do so.  The wheels are simply lashed down
to some ring bolts, lashed down with rope, and we could
cut them adrift as easy as winking."</p>
<p>He and Mr. Hamilton went ashore together and came
off late at night, and we all waited for them, and knew
that something was in the "wind", but they wouldn't say
what, and only told us that they wanted twenty pounds.
Mr. Langham said that he would give ten (he was very
well off) if we would subscribe the rest, and you may
bet your best waistcoat we got that other ten pounds
pretty quickly.</p>
<p>We hadn't the faintest notion why he wanted it till
two nights after, and then, just before "lights out" in
the gunroom, he sent for us all and told us.</p>
<p>My aunt! it was jolly exciting.</p>
<p>He had bought a sampan—one of the Chinese sailing
boats which used to bring us off from the shore if we
missed the ordinary ship's boat—and had had two large
holes made in the bottom, with plugs fitted in them and
ropes made fast to each, so that a jolly good strong jerk
would pull them out.  He had had her loaded with stones,
so that she would sink quickly after they'd been pulled out.</p>
<p>"I'm going to sail her across the <emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> bowsprit,"
he said, "and shall get my rigging foul of her, if possible.
If I can't, I have a grapnel, and shall catch hold of her
cable, and when the sampan can't drift away, I shall pull
out those plugs and begin "hullabalooing" like a
Chinaman.  When she sinks I shall hold on to the buoy and
go on squealing till the quartermaster comes along, and
when he hears where I am he'll probably get into the
dinghy to pick me up.</p>
<p>"I sha'n't be there when he comes," he added, grinning.
Of course, in a small gunboat the only man on watch
at night is the quartermaster, and if there wasn't much of
a row, he probably would not call anyone else.</p>
<p>"Now, what you have to do is this"—we all got
fearfully excited—"I've asked the Commander for his gig
to-night, told him I wanted it for a special purpose, and
he played the game and didn't ask for what, and said
she needn't be hoisted out of the water.  She's quite
big enough to take the gun and carriage, and Hamilton
and the 'A.P.' and six of the strongest of you mids
have to go away in her at about half-past two in the
middle watch.  You must be down astern of her, not
close enough to let her spot you, by a quarter to three,
and then wait till you hear me start squealing.</p>
<p>"The <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> has her dinghy made fast to the starboard
boom to-night, so you'll have to pull alongside her
port gangway as 'gingerly' as ever you can, get aboard
and bring back the gun, and the carriage too, if you've
got time.  The trunnions of the gun are only secured in
the carriage by bands, and there are pins in them which
can be pulled out—well, a good many of you have seen
them already.  Don't worry about me; I'll swim back."</p>
<p>That was the scheme which he and Mr. Hamilton had
worked out between them, and it was jolly exciting.
Mr. Hamilton was to go in charge of the gig, and as he
was very strong—nearly as strong as the Sub himself—he
had to do the lifting with Mr. Moore (the A.P.).
Webster, Jones, and Jim Rawlings and three of the others
were told off to pull the oars, because they were the
strongest of the mids.</p>
<p>"Dicky", who was quite all right now, wasn't to go,
because he was too excitable, and "Pongo" was too
fat and useless.  I wasn't going either at first, but I
implored them to let me steer.  I could manage with
one hand, if they fixed up the wooden tiller the
Commander used when he took the gig away sailing, and I
said that I had some right to go, because the gun had
fired at me so often.  Jim backed me up, and
Mr. Langham agreed that I had some right, but told me
that I should have to sit on the gunwale, behind the
stern sheets, so as not to crowd the boat too much.</p>
<p>You may jolly well imagine that I didn't care where
I sat or what I did, so long as I could take my share
in the job.</p>
<p>Presently Mr. Langham compared his watch with
Mr. Hamilton's, and went ashore in a very old flannel suit;
and we had to turn in and pretend to sleep, though that
was impossible, and we kept on running up on deck to
see what kind of a night it was.</p>
<p>It turned out to be jolly dark, which was splendid;
but there was only a very little breeze, and that was
blowing from Kowloon, on the mainland, straight towards
Hong-Kong.  This was a nuisance, because it meant that
Mr. Langham would have to beat off shore in the
sampan, and as there would be a jolly strong tide running,
it would be very difficult to just hit off the buoy and the
<emphasis>Ringdove's</emphasis> bows, especially as he was going to do it
single-handed.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton was rather worried about this, and just
after midnight he came along to Jim and told him he
had better go ashore, find Mr. Langham, and help him
sail her.  Jim was about the strongest swimmer of all
us mids; that was why he chose him.  And Jim was
jolly keen to go, and Mr. Hamilton pulled him ashore in
the skiff, told him where he would find the sampan, and
pulled back again.</p>
<p>Well, I never thought the time for starting would ever
come; but at last "four bells" struck, and we all dressed,
Dicky helping me because of my arm, and we sneaked
on deck like mice, and there was the gig waiting for us
alongside.</p>
<p>Mr. Trevelyan was the officer of the watch, and I heard
Mr. Hamilton say to him, "Going for a little exercise,
Trevelyan;" and heard him reply, "Well, good luck!
I've got everything ready to hoist it in."  So of course
he must have known all about it.</p>
<p>We crept down into the boat; I squatted in the stern,
jammed my feet against the ribs there to prevent myself
falling overboard, and we shoved off without making a
sound, and pulled away till we were some way astern of
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>, catching hold of the next buoy to hers and
hanging on to it.</p>
<p>Then we waited in the dark.</p>
<p>We couldn't see a single light in her except her
"riding" light for'ard, and a very faint glimmer
amidships, where the quartermaster ought to be.  Presently
five bells were struck aboard the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> and aboard
the old <emphasis>Tamar</emphasis> astern of us, and a few moments afterwards
we saw a light moving for'ard aboard the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>,
her funny, "tin-kettly" bell was struck, the light
came aft again, and we knew that the quartermaster, at
any rate, was awake.</p>
<p>"Old Langham ought to be shoving off now," Mr. Hamilton
whispered.  It was so dark round us that we
couldn't see twenty yards; but the shore lights lighted
the water close in under Murray Pier, and we all
kept our eyes turned that way, and presently saw a
sail show out for a moment, and whispered, "There
they come," and got terribly excited.</p>
<p>One always forgets how excited one has been before,
when other things happened, but really I do think that
I was fearfully excited now—as much as I have ever
been.</p>
<p>We waited and waited, and got the oars ready, and
then, all of a sudden, we heard a sound from the dark,
as if something was knocking up against a buoy.  I
almost fell backwards overboard, but saved myself by
clutching the tiller, and then there were most piteous
yells, two different kinds, so that I knew Jim was there,
and we shoved off and pulled very quickly.</p>
<p>"Port gangway!" Mr. Hamilton whispered to me, and
I steered for it; and as we gradually crept under the stern,
we saw the quartermaster's lantern moving for'ard and
then saw it on the fo'c'stle.</p>
<p>Mr. Hamilton had to help me steer her, there was such
a strong tide running; but we were fearfully careful, and
got the gig alongside, and Jones held on in the bows, and
Mr. Hamilton and the "A.P." and Webster disappeared
up the gangway in their bare feet, with a tackle the Bo's'n
had given us.  We could hear them very softly getting
the gun out of the carriage, and the Chinese kind of yells
were still going on, only more gently, and we heard the
quartermaster sing out, "Who's there?" and presently he
sung out, "Hold on, and I'll fetch the dinghy!"—though
how he thought Chinamen could understand him I don't
know.</p>
<p>The lantern was thumped down on the fo'c'stle, and
he climbed along the starboard boom, and in a very little
while there was a splash of oars, and we knew that he
was pulling to the buoy.</p>
<p>I knew that we were all grinning, although we couldn't
see each other, and imagined Mr. Langham and Jim
swimming away out of sight; and I was rather nervous
about Jim, because the tide was so strong, and it was
quite five hundred yards back to the <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>.</p>
<p>However, there wasn't time to worry, as Mr. Hamilton
and the "A.P." were coming down the ladder with the
gun in their arms, and the gangway creaked at every
step, and we were very frightened because the noise
seemed so loud.  They slid it down into the stern sheets
on to a gymnasium mat we had put there to deaden the
sound, and back they went.  We heard something drop
on the deck, and it seemed to make an awful row, and
presently they came to the gangway again, and all of
them were lifting the gun carriage, and they began lowering
it into the boat with the tackle.  You see, it was such
an awfully awkward thing to handle, though it wasn't
really very heavy.</p>
<p>Then we were absolutely petrified with fear, for suddenly
we heard Mr. Rashleigh's voice bawling for the quartermaster,
and could hear him coming along from under the
poop, cursing, and wanting to know where he was, and
what all the noise was about.</p>
<p>The gun carriage was only lowered halfway down, but
Mr. Hamilton sang out very softly, "Stand clear!" and
dropped the whole thing into the boat on top of the gun
(I don't know how it was that it didn't break anybody),
and they all jumped down in a heap, making a most
fearful row.  Jones slipped the boat rope for'ard, and we
slid astern just as Mr. Rashleigh ran up to the gangway
and began singing out and cursing, asking who it was,
and what it was, and "Where's that quartermaster?"</p>
<p>He was in a towering passion, and we could imagine
what a jolly funny sight he must be in his bulgy pyjamas,
with his round red face and his bald head, but were jolly
glad that there wasn't any light for us to see him or he us.
We hadn't moved a muscle—not even those who had
fallen in a jumble on top of each other—and simply let
the tide take us down right under the stern, where it
was tremendously dark, and he couldn't possibly see anything.</p>
<p>I don't think that he had discovered at first what had
really happened, and kept cursing into the dark, but then
must have found our tackle, for he was absolutely silent,
and we guessed that he must have found that the gun
wasn't there.</p>
<p>By that time the quartermaster had come back, and the
last we heard was a glorious row going on.  My aunt! you
should have heard him storming.</p>
<p>We were well astern now, and Mr. Hamilton and the
"A.P." and Webster disentangled themselves, and we
got out the oars and pulled a roundabout way back to the
<emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>.  She was pitch dark, even the quarterdeck
gangway lamps were turned off, and we had to feel our way
very gingerly to the side.  This was so that we shouldn't
be seen getting the gun on board.  The rest of the
gunroom and most of the ward-room officers were up there,
and had a tackle rigged, all ready, and got the gun and
the carriage on deck in no time.</p>
<p>They carried them for'ard to hide, and put the gun in
the sand tank, covering it up with sand, and the carriage
was taken to pieces and stowed away in one of the
gunner's storerooms.</p>
<p>We were all so excited, that I forgot all about
Mr. Langham and Jim till Mr. Langham came dripping up
the gangway, asking if everything was all right, and if
Jim had turned up, as he had lost sight of him after
leaving the buoy.</p>
<p>"A jolly strong tide's running, and it was about as
much as I could do to get here," he said, rather out of
breath, and rather anxiously.</p>
<p>We all peered over the side, and tried to see his head
coming along; but it was too dark to see anything at all,
although Dicky and I went down to the foot of the
accommodation ladder and looked along the surface of the water.
Poor Dicky was almost off his head with fright.  He kept
on squeaking out: "Jim!  Jim!" but daren't do it too
loudly.  And we listened, but there was no answer, and
I, too, was quite frightened, and wished that we could do
something, only it was so jolly difficult to know what
to do, and no one dare make a great noise, or run a
searchlight, or anything like that, for fear of having to
wake the Captain or the Commander, and giving the
whole show away.</p>
<p>But Mr. Langham—just as he was, wringing wet—the
"A.P." and Mr. Hamilton and four mids went away in
the gig.</p>
<p>"He'll probably have drifted down with the tide, and
will try and get hold of a buoy," Mr. Hamilton told me,
and they disappeared in the darkness.</p>
<p>I could not go down below, because I was so worried,
and had the most horrid feelings inside me, which Dicky
made worse by asking such silly questions.  Everything
was so horribly dark, and the tide was running so
strongly, and I knew that Jim must be in fearful danger,
although Mr. Trevelyan kept saying that he would turn
up all right.</p>
<p>I had forgotten all about the wretched gun, till
someone—"Pongo", I think it was—said to Mr. Trevelyan,
"Jolly to have the gun all right, sir, and the carriage.
Isn't it, sir?" And Mr. Trevelyan answered, "What
gun?  I don't know anything about a gun.  I've been
forward with the quartermaster for the last quarter of
an hour, and haven't seen anything."</p>
<p>I believe that the silly ass would have begun telling
him, if Mr. Trevelyan hadn't said, "What the dickens
are you doing up here at this time?  Go and turn in at
once!"</p>
<p>I really wasn't quite sure, then, whether he was
"pretending" or not.</p>
<p>We waited for nearly half an hour, we all were fearfully
nervous, and Mr. Trevelyan kept on saying, "I shall have
to wake the Commander if he doesn't come back in
another three minutes," and would wait, and say it again.
And at last he actually started to go down to the
Commander's cabin, but before he had got halfway down,
the <emphasis>Tyne's</emphasis> masthead signal lamp began winking and
blinking.</p>
<p>"She's calling us up, sir!" the signalman sang out;
and oh! it was such a relief, for she signalled,
"Mr. Rawlings is aboard", and I was awfully thankful.  She
was right astern of us, quite half a mile, and he must
have been drowned if he had missed her, as there was
nothing astern of her, no buoys, or ships, or anything
to hold on to.</p>
<p>Dicky ran down below.  He is such a soft-hearted chap.</p>
<p>We signalled across that we would send for him, and
three of the ward room officers, in their pyjamas, fetched
him in the skiff, and I almost blubbed with delight when
he came alongside, looking like a drowned rat, and pulling
at an oar to warm himself.</p>
<p>We got him down below and out of his wet things,
and presently Mr. Langham and the others came back
in the gig.</p>
<p>They had pulled round all the buoys astern of the
<emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis> and tried to find him, and alongside the <emphasis>Tamar</emphasis>,
hoping to find him there, and then, as a last chance, in
a terrible state of fright, to the <emphasis>Tyne</emphasis>, and had got the
good news that he had just gone back in our skiff.</p>
<p>"I thought it was all U P," Mr. Langham said, and
changed into dry things; and then we all had a sardine
supper in the gunroom, and most of the ward-room officers
came down too, and we were awfully happy and contented,
and Jim and Dicky and I "whoofed" two whole tins of
sardines between us.  Jim told me that he was pretty
nearly "done" when he managed to grab hold of the
<emphasis>Tyne's</emphasis> gangway, and couldn't drag himself out of the
water till he had sung out, and someone had come down
and given him a hand.</p>
<p>We had to be awfully quiet, for fear of disturbing the
Commander, whose cabin was just overhead, and that
was the only drawback to the supper.</p>
<p>Then we all turned into our hammocks; but Jim and I
were much too excited to sleep, and besides, we had eaten
too much.</p>
<p>Wasn't that a glorious night, and hadn't we jolly well
got level with Mr. Rashleigh?</p>
<p>"Worth the risk, every time," Jim whispered.</p>
<p>"But won't there be a glorious row to-morrow?" Dicky
squeaked.  He was frightened about it already.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XIX</strong></p>

<empty-line/>
<p>"Old Lest" Flares Up—Recaptured from the Ringdove—Sally
Again</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Captain Marshall, Royal Marine Light Infantry</emphasis></p>
<p>Old Truscott has asked me to write this chapter, because
he says that he is so confoundedly busy paying off the old
<emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, that he hasn't a moment to himself.</p>
<p>That is his reason for not being bothered with the job;
but for all that he manages to get into plain clothes all
right, and fly to the beach and the bosom of his family,
directly after evening "quarters" every day.  He is so
beastly happy, that I don't really mind shoving another
chapter into this immortal book for him.</p>
<p>Although it is three months since we left Hong-Kong,
I shall never forget old Rashleigh, in frockcoat and
sword, coming fuming on board there, and wanting to
see the Skipper about that wretched pop-gun which he
swore we had stolen from him during the night.</p>
<p>I most distinctly remember having assisted to hoist
something on board, at a most unusual hour of the
night, but of course it was much too dark for anyone to
be able to swear their Bible oath that it was his gun,
though it certainly seemed to be wonderfully like it.</p>
<p>I said "good morning" to him as kindly as I could, and
mentioned the fact that we were having very seasonable
weather for this time of the year; but he was most
distinctly rude, and when I saw his little eyes sticking out
of his head, squinting round the quarterdeck and expecting
to see his gun there, I nearly died of laughing.</p>
<p>His coxswain followed him up the ladder with some
rope and blocks and flung them down on the deck.</p>
<p>"There's your confounded tackle you left aboard me
last night.  You're a confounded lot of burglars, the whole
boiling lot of you," Rashleigh said to the Commander,
and I am certain I could detect some slight traces of
irritation in his manner.</p>
<p>Old Truscott himself flared up then—I'd never seen him
angry before—and cursed the coxswain for throwing the
tackle on the quarterdeck, and ordered him to pick it up
again.  He then took the fat little sausage, stamping with
rage and red as a lobster, down to see the Skipper,
whilst the others hauled me into the battery, banged me
on the back, and implored me in the most gentlemanly
way to stow "'hee-hawing', like a whole pack of jackasses,
you chump-headed son-of-a-sea-cook, or you'll be giving
the whole show away".</p>
<p>As Trevelyan had been the officer of the watch when
the dastardly outrage was supposed to have taken place,
he was sent for to throw some light on the subject, and
after Rashleigh had gone away we heard from him all
that had happened down there.</p>
<p>Neither the Skipper nor Truscott actually did know
anything about it at all, and when Rashleigh, like the
blundering ass that he was, suggested that they both did, the
Skipper naturally flew into a rage, and after Trevelyan
and the quartermaster who had been on duty at the time
had sworn blindly that they'd seen nothing come on board
during their watch (they had taken jolly care to be out
of the way whilst we hoisted it in), he roared out, "What
have you to say to that?" and little Rashleigh didn't know
what to say, but was so madly angry, and so certain that
no other ship could have taken it, that he stammered out
that he would like the ship searched.</p>
<p>"Search 'Old Lest's' ship for your lousy gun!  You!
You!——"</p>
<p>Fortunately the Skipper could never do justice to his
vocabulary when he really was angry, so could not think
of any particularly appropriate epithets suitable for this
occasion.</p>
<p>But Rashleigh wasn't finished with yet, and stuttered
out, "I'll report the whole thing to the Commander-in-chief!"</p>
<p>"Report till you're blue in the face!" the Skipper roared.
"You've got no blessed right to the gun—no more right
than the other gunboats; you got it under false pretences,
in the first place;" and he shook his fists at him.</p>
<p>"If a gun and its carriage—umph!—can be taken off
your quarterdeck without anyone knowing about it, you
must run your ship in a pretty smart way.  Umph!  If
you can't be trusted to keep it safely, I'll take jolly good
care you don't get the chance again.  You got it by a
lie—yes, a downright lie—and if it does turn up aboard
here, you can shout yourself hoarse for it.  'Old Lest's'
blowed if he'll give it you again."</p>
<p>The Skipper practically turned him out of his cabin, and
ordered him to take the tackle back with him.  Rashleigh
was so furious when he went back, that he was quite white
in the face; and I mentioned the fact to old Barclay as a
phenomenon of medical interest, but he was so busy trying
to prevent himself exploding with laughter, that the
interesting information was wasted on him.</p>
<p>It was lucky that we left Hong-Kong two days afterwards,
for feeling ran so high between the two ships, that
otherwise there would have been serious trouble ashore
between our liberty men and hers.</p>
<p>We steamed slowly away for "England, Home, and
Beauty", with our paying-off pendant streaming from
our masthead, and the gilt bladder at its end jumping
about in the water astern of us, our wretched band
blaring away "For Auld Lang Syne"—a most inappropriate
tune for the "Ringdoves"—and "Rolling Home
for Merry England", till we were halfway through
Lyemoon Pass.</p>
<p>The Commodore had made a "general signal"—"Cheer
Ship"—and the unhappy "Ringdoves" had to climb on
her nettings and give us three cheers as we passed, though
little Rashleigh didn't appear on deck, as you may
imagine.  "Hardly what you'd call 'arty cheers," I
mentioned to old Whitmore, who had been brought up on
deck to see the last of Hong-Kong.</p>
<p>We returned them with three absolutely "top hole"
shouts, for there were only two people aboard who didn't
know for certain that the gun was somewhere on board
us—the Skipper and Truscott—and they all knew that the
"Ringdoves" had no more right to it than the man in the
moon, so cheered "according".</p>
<p>We stayed a couple of months at Singapore, waiting
for the <emphasis>Fisgard</emphasis> to come out and relieve us.</p>
<p>At last she arrived; we transferred some of the mids
and cadets to her, cheered ship, and away we went for
Colombo and home.</p>
<p>I assure you, on my solemn "Alfred Davy", that till
next morning neither the Skipper nor Truscott did know
anything about that gun, however much they may have
suspected.  When I went on deck, the first morning after
leaving Singapore, there it was, mounted on its carriage,
just below the muzzle of our after eight-inch gun.  A brass
plate had been screwed on to the carriage and engraved
with—"This gun was captured during the operations
against Chinese pirates in the Hector Islands, and
presented by the Officers and Ship's Company of
H.M.S. <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> to Captain Chas. E. Lester, R.N., and
Mrs. Lester".</p>
<p>They had had the plate engraved ashore at Singapore.</p>
<p>Of course the Skipper saw it directly he came up to
"divisions" and "morning prayers", and it was as good
as a play to watch his face.</p>
<p>Truscott had been let into the secret an hour before, and
he and the chief boatswain's mate asked the Skipper if he
would mind accepting it.</p>
<p>"Mind accepting it?" he roared, when he'd read the
inscription on the brass plate, and "Blucher" had sniffed
round the wheels, "Mind accepting it?  I'm proud to
accept it, and the missus will be prouder still.  Umph!
You're a darned set of rascals!  But that plate, wants
something added to it.  How about 'Recaptured from
the <emphasis>Ringdove</emphasis>'?"</p>
<p>The men all laughed and guffawed.  They were as
pleased as "Punch".</p>
<p>"There is something I'd like to have on that gun,"
he growled, more gently—"the names of those of us
who were killed; and if the Commander and the chief
bo's'n's mate will see to that, 'Old Lest''ll take it home
with him.  Umph!  When we get home I'm going to try
to get you a week's extra leave—for your active
service—if none of you give the Commander any trouble at
Portsmouth."</p>
<p>The men were dismissed, and crowded for'ard, as happy
as kings, and I heard the Skipper growl to, old Truscott,
"Umph! you rascal, waited till we got off the China
station, did you?  Umph!"</p>
<p>"I knew nothing about it till this morning, I assure
you, sir," he answered.</p>
<p>"Umph!" he grunted to me, "you're looking mighty
pleased with yourself.  What did you have to do with
it, eh?"</p>
<p>"I did happen to lend a hand at hoisting in something
very like it, sir."</p>
<p>"You're a disgrace to the marines," he growled, and
went below grandly pleased.</p>

<p>*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p>By the end of August we were made fast to the north
railway jetty at Portsmouth, and, as I knew they
would—my troubles began.  They were mostly connected with
unpaid bills, so I won't bother you with them; but it was
Grainger, my trusty servant, who was more angry at them
bothering me than I was myself.</p>
<p>"'Ere's a 'ome-comin', sir," he said mournfully, as he
was packing my gear and snorting at the condition of
my worn-out plain clothes; "'ere's a 'ome-comin', and
arter all we've done for "The Corps", to say nothink
of the wound in your for'ud, and that 'ere jab in the leg,
and those trouses and serges, abso—lutely ruinationed.
We can't 'ardly turn you out fit to march the de—tachment
into barracks, sir, that we can't."</p>
<p>One thing gave him a little pleasure, and that was
producing an eyeglass which he'd carefully preserved in
a corner of a drawer.  I thought that I had broken my
last one before leaving Aden, but he had been keeping
this one to make certain that, when the time came for
marching into barracks, I should have one jammed in my
port optic.  "They'll think there's summat gone wrong
with us, sir, if you don't 'ave it—up in the hofficers'
mess."</p>
<p>Some of us had expected to be made a fuss of when
we arrived at Portsmouth; but it was four months since
the papers had been full of our exploits, and everyone had
forgotten all about them—and us.</p>
<p>Old "B.-T.'s" leg was all right again, and he and I
got Old Bax to advance us some pay, and had a couple
of days in London together.  We ran up against—whom
do you think?  Old man Hobbs and Sally—my little
princess looking absolutely sweet.  They had come along
across Canada.</p>
<p>We helped them choose a dressing-bag for Ching, of
the <emphasis>Huan Min</emphasis>.  It was fitted with more things than I
dreamt could be crowded into a bag—everything
gold-mounted, and costing a small fortune.</p>
<p>What the Christopher Columbus old Ching would do
with it, "B.-T." and I couldn't think; and we knew, jolly
well, that the only thing he would want to find in it was
my little princess herself.</p>
<p>We dined with them at their hotel, and next night
"stood" them a theatre, and supper afterwards.</p>
<p>Old "B.-T." wasn't in very good form, because I'd cut
him out with the little princess—my little princess—and
he'd been saddled with old man Hobbs, and didn't like
it a little bit.</p>
<p>They'd asked us to spend some of our leave with them
up in Scotland; but "B.-T." had the "hump", and
refused, though you may bet your life I was going, if I
could only raise enough money to pay my fares.</p>
<p>*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p>"What d'you think of me getting married?" I asked
Grainger, when he brought my breakfast the morning
after my return to the ship.</p>
<p>"Who's it this time, sir?"</p>
<p>"What d'you say to a princess?"</p>
<p>"If she be a real princess, sir," he snorted, "she won't
darn your socks, so won't be no 'elp to me.  You don't
want none of them sort, sir.  You want one of 'em
steadyin' kind of ones, if you don't mind me a-sayin' so, sir."</p>
<p>"Just you wait and see," I told him.</p>
<p>I had asked them to come down to Portsmouth, to see
the old <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis> again, and they did.  They stayed there
till we paid off, and I had a great deal of difficulty to boom
the others away from my little princess, but managed it
fairly successfully.</p>
<p>At last the great day of paying off did arrive, the white
ensign and the pendant were hauled down, and we all
began scattering to the winds.</p>
<p>Everyone said goodbye to everyone else, and I shook
hands with dear "Old Lest".</p>
<p>"Umph!  Where are you going?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Going to march the detachment into barracks, sir."</p>
<p>"Umph!  I know that.  What are you doing with your leave?"</p>
<p>"Going up to Scotland, sir."</p>
<p>"Umph!" he growled.  "That's it, is it?  When you
get tired of Scotland, come down and get a bit of shooting
with 'Blucher' and me.  The missus will be glad to see
you."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much, sir, but I hope not to get tired
of Scotland as soon as that," and marched down the gangway
to the shore for the last time.  The old sergeant-major
reported the detachment present; I sung out, "Royal
Marines!  At'shun!  Shoulder arms!  Left turn!  Quick
march!" and we left the old <emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, which had been
our home for three years, and embarked in a tug for
Clarence Victualling Yard, at Gosport, where headquarters'
band was waiting to play us into barracks.</p>
<p>I left Grainger behind to bring all my gear across later on.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XX</strong></p>
<p><strong>Home Again</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Paying Off—Home Again</p>
<p><emphasis>Written by Midshipman Ford</emphasis></p>
<p>Jim Rawlings, Dicky Morton, and I had been such a very
short time on the China station, that we all three ought to
have gone to the <emphasis>Fisgard</emphasis> when she came out to relieve us.</p>
<p>But just after we had reached Singapore, the Captain
asked me whether I wanted to go home with him in the
<emphasis>Vigilant</emphasis>, and though I felt an awful brute at leaving Jim
and Dicky, I simply jumped at the chance.  I wanted to
see them at home so much, and go back to Upton Overy
and see people nod at each other, and know that they were
saying, "That be Master Dick who saved the Cap'en's
life," that I forgot all about the other two.  I was jolly
sad to see them go aboard the <emphasis>Fisgard</emphasis> with their chests,
and they were jolly sad too.  Dicky was quite well now,
and not half the ass that he had been when he first joined.</p>
<p>What made them more sad than anything else, was not
being able to see the Chinese field gun given to the
Captain.  We gave it to him the morning after they left, when
we were at sea.  He was awfully delighted with it.  You
could see that by the way he patted it, and ran his fingers
over it, and lifted it out of its carriage to test his strength,
grunting and growling splendidly.</p>
<p>I wrote to tell Jim all about it, and sent the letter from
Aden.</p>
<p>Before we left Singapore, we got the English papers
with the accounts of all our fighting, and I was awfully
proud to see my name in among the severely wounded,
and rather expected that they would make a great fuss of
us all at Portsmouth.  They didn't, however, and when
I went ashore to give "Blucher" a run, and got out of
the dockyard gates on to the "Hard", I was disappointed
that people didn't take the least notice; you know the
funny sort of feeling one has.  I kept on thinking whether
any of them had an idea that I had been the captain of the
junk <emphasis>Sally</emphasis>, and had been all that terrible night in the walled
house.</p>
<p>Wasn't it strange for Mr. Hobbs and Sally to turn up
there whilst we were paying off?  A lot of our chaps think
that she's "spoony" on Captain Marshall, but I rather
think that she'd be "spoony" on anyone who was tall
and good looking—if he took any notice of her.</p>
<p>Mr. Travers thinks so too, because I heard him tell
Captain Marshall so; but he only "hee-hawed", and said
something about "sour grapes".</p>
<p>She was jolly smartly rigged out, and Webster said she
looked a perfect "knock out"; and she came down into
the gunroom one afternoon with Captain Marshall, and,
I suppose, had forgotten about poor old Withers, because
she wanted to play the piano.  Mr. Langham sent for the
armourer to force the lock, and it was Miller who came,
and she recognized him, and asked him if he remembered
carrying her across the garden in that walled house.  He
got frightfully red and out of breath, and scratched a lot of
veneer off the piano.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lester came to stay at Portsmouth, and was jolly
nice to me.  She came so that the Chinese gun could be
properly presented to her, and the men were awfully pleased.</p>
<p>You remember Martin, the marine, and how he had
made me so tired by telling me so often about having
tried to save my life.  Well, this had taught me not
to remind people about things like that, so I never even
led up to it; but Mrs. Lester said awfully jolly things
about my having shot that brute.  She had brought
messages from my mother and Nan, and from lots of
people; but my mother couldn't come herself, because
she couldn't afford to, and I had to wait to see her till
we "paid off", and I went on leave.</p>
<p>I did go to see Mrs. Scroggs and all Scroggs's children.
She had come to live quite close to Portsmouth, and
Sharpe, the petty officer, came with me, and we had
a very "weepy" time, because she was so miserable,
and cried a great deal, and said that it was awfully
hard to make both ends meet on her pension, even with
what we had subscribed.  The children were all growing
up, and wanting boots and things, and had most tremendous
appetites.</p>
<p>I was jolly glad to get away, and I'm certain that Sharpe
was.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lester went back two or three days before we
actually did "pay off", and then came the morning when
we all said goodbye.  The marines marched away, and the
bluejackets streamed ashore with their bags on their
shoulders to go on leave, and cabs came rattling up to take us
to the station.</p>
<p>I did intend to walk, because all my heavy gear had
gone to the "outfitters", and I only had two small
bags and some paper parcels with that boat's ensign
and the presents for Nan and my father and mother;
but the Captain called out, "Comin' with me, Dick?"
and I actually went with him and "Blucher" in his
cab, with "Willum" sitting up on the box, and right
the way to Upton Overy with him in a first-class carriage.
He paid for it, too, and gave me some grub at Salisbury,
and a ripping tea at Exeter.</p>
<p>We didn't get to Upton Overy till ten o'clock at night,
and I was so jolly excited, and so fearfully proud of being
with the Captain, that I couldn't feel tired; and when we
ran into the station they fired off fog signals, and there
were flags all over the place.  Old Puddock, the station
master, opened the door, and Mrs. Puddock "bobbed"
behind him, and I caught sight of my mother under
a lamp, and forgot all about my bags and parcels, and
rushed across to her.</p>
<p>"Blucher" nearly went off his head with joy, and chased
Mr. Puddock's cat till it turned round and faced him, and
then he forgot about it.  I do believe that everyone in
Upton Overy was waiting outside, and there were more
flags in the streets, and a triumphal arch, and Mrs. Lester
was waiting in one of the carriages.  Everyone was cheering
like mad, and the fishermen had taken the horses out
of the carriage and were going to pull the Captain up to
The House.</p>
<p>My mother and I slipped away—I'd asked Puddock
to send up my things—and got home, and it was grand
being back again, though my father was very worried,
and hardly cheered up when he saw me.  My mother had
told me how miserable he was, and that I must be very
quiet and not talk too much or too loudly, so that rather
took the gilt off the gingerbread.</p>
<p>Even when I showed them the white ensign with the
bullet holes in it, and told them all about it, he only
said that it was a shame to send a child like me away on
such a job, and said it was time to be going to bed, and he
was thankful that I wasn't a cripple for life after having
my arm smashed.</p>
<p>"He'll be all right to-morrow," my mother told me, and
I showed her my arm, and the places where the bullet had
gone through it, and moved my fingers, and picked up
heavy things to show her that it really was quite strong,
and that I should not have to leave the Service and simply
stay at home and be an expense to them, and we just
hugged each other, and I went to bed presently.</p>
<p>I was up again very early in the morning, and ran down
to the beach to see all my chums in the fishing boats, and
they "bucked me up" splendidly.  They all crowded
round, and had heard about everything—everything—and
they told me all the news, and that Ned the Poacher
was in prison, and his wife and children had gone to the
workhouse, and that old Gurridge was coming back at the
end of the week and wanted to see me, and I slipped back
in time to prevent my mother worrying about where I'd
gone, and after breakfast I rushed up to The House.</p>
<p>The Captain was there in his old shooting suit, with
a gun over his shoulder, and "Blucher" was careering
all over the flower beds, and not stopping when he was
told to.  "Umph!  I'll shoot that dog if he don't come
to heel when I tell him," the Captain grunted, and I ran
off and managed to catch him.  I knew jolly well that old
"Blucher" might have destroyed every flower in the place
if he wanted to, for anything the Captain would have done
to him.</p>
<p>"What became of you, Dick, last night?  The missus
waited for you and your mother till we couldn't wait any
longer.  Umph!  Must go down and see her and the
Parson after lunch."</p>
<p>I very much hoped that he wouldn't, because I was
afraid my father would say something to him about
sending me away in charge of that junk.  I told him
about Ned the Poacher and his wife.</p>
<p>"Umph!  Serve the beggar right; we'll see what we
can do about his missus and the kids.  Umph!  Go in
and see the girls, and then come along with 'Blucher'.
I'm going after rabbits."</p>
<p>I'd brought a Chinese embroidered skirt for Nan, and
she simply loved it, and I couldn't get away, and didn't
want to, and presently the Captain began bellowing "that
he couldn't wait till Domesday", and Nan said, "I'll come
too", and we raced each other round to the stables to get
"Blucher's" chain, and off we went.</p>
<p>It was awfully ripping, and "Blucher" gave us no end
of a time, pulling us about whenever the Captain fired his
gun.</p>

<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
