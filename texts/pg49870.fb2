MY WIFE</p>
<p><strong>THE SILENCE OF COLONEL BRAMBLE</strong></p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER I</strong></p>
<p>The Highland Brigade was holding
its regimental boxing match in a
fine old Flemish barn in the
neighbourhood of Poperinghe.  At the end of
the evening the general got on to a chair
and, in a clear, audible voice, said:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, we have to-day seen some
excellent fighting, from which I think we
may learn some useful lessons for the more
important contest that we shall shortly
resume; we must keep our heads, we
must keep our eyes open, we must hit
seldom but hit hard, and we must fight to
a finish."</p>
<p>Three cheers made the old barn shake.
The motors purred at the door.  Colonel
Bramble, Major Parker and the French
interpreter, Aurelle, went on foot to their
billets among the hops and beetroot fields.</p>
<p>"We are a curious nation," said Major
Parker.  "To interest a Frenchman in a
boxing match you must tell him that his
national honour is at stake.  To interest an
Englishman in a war you need only suggest
that it is a kind of a boxing match.  Tell
us that the Hun is a barbarian, we agree
politely, but tell us that he is a bad
sportsman and you rouse the British
Empire."</p>
<p>"It is the Hun's fault," said the colonel
sadly, "that war is no longer a gentleman's
game."</p>
<p>"We never imagined," continued the
major, "that such cads existed.  Bombing
open towns is nearly as unpardonable as
fishing for trout with a worm, or shooting
a fox."</p>
<p>"You must not exaggerate, Parker," said
the colonel calmly.  "They are not as bad
as that yet."</p>
<p>Then he asked Aurelle politely if the
boxing had amused him.</p>
<p>"I particularly admired, sir, the sporting
discipline of your men.  During the boxing
the Highlanders behaved as if they were in
church."</p>
<p>"The true sporting spirit has always
something religious about it," said the
major.  "A few years ago when the New
Zealand football team visited England, and
from the first match beat the English
teams, the country was as upset as if we
had lost this war.  Every one in the streets
and trains went about with long faces.
Then the New Zealanders beat Scotland,
then Ireland; the end of the world had
come!  However, there remained the
Welsh.  On the day of the match there
were one hundred thousand persons on the
ground.  You know that the Welsh are
deeply religious and that their national
anthem, 'Land of our Fathers,' is also a
prayer.  When the two teams arrived the
whole crowd, men and women, exalted and
confident, sang this hymn to God before
the battle, and the New Zealanders were
beaten.  Ah, we are a great nation!"</p>
<p>"Indeed, yes," said Aurelle, quite overcome,
"you are a great nation."  He added,
after a moment's silence, "But you were
also quite right just now when you said you
were a curious nation in some things, and
your opinion of people astonishes us
sometimes.  You say, 'Brown looks an idiot,
but he's not, he played cricket for Essex.'  Or,
'At Eton we took him for a fool, but
at Oxford he surprised us.  Do you know
he is plus four at golf, and won the high
jump?'"</p>
<p>"Well?" said the colonel.</p>
<p>"Don't you think, sir, that cleverness——"</p>
<p>"I hate clever people——  Oh, I beg
your pardon, messiou."</p>
<p>"That's very kind of you, sir," said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"Glad you take it like that," growled the
colonel into his moustache.</p>
<p>He spoke seldom and always in short
sentences, but Aurelle had learnt to
appreciate his dry and vigorous humour and the
charming smile which often lit up his
rugged countenance.</p>
<p>"But don't you find yourself, Aurelle,"
went on Major Parker, "that intelligence is
over-estimated with you?  It is certainly
more useful to know how to box than how
to write.  You would like Eton to go in
for nothing but learning?  It is just like
asking a trainer of racehorses to be
interested in circus horses.  We don't go to
school to learn, but to be soaked in the
prejudices of our class, without which we
should be useless and unhappy.  We are
like the young Persians Herodotus talks
about, who up to the age of twenty only
learnt three sciences: to ride, to shoot and
to tell the truth."</p>
<p>"That may be," said Aurelle, "but just
see, major, how inconsistent you are.  You
despise learning and you quote Herodotus.
Better still, I caught you the other day in
the act of reading a translation of Xenophon
in your dug-out.  Very few Frenchmen, I
assure you——"</p>
<p>"That's quite different," said the major.
"The Greeks and Romans interest us, not
as objects of study, but as ancestors and
sportsmen.  We are the direct heirs of the
mode of life of the Greeks and of the Roman
Empire.  Xenophon amuses me because he
is a perfect type of the English gentleman,
with his hunting and fishing stories, and
descriptions of battles.  When I read in
Cicero: 'Scandal in the Colonial Office.
Grave accusations against Sir Marcus Varro,
Governor-General of Sicily,' you can well
understand that that sounds to me like old
family history.  And who was your Alcibiades,
pray, but a Winston Churchill,
without the hats?"</p>
<p>The scenery round them was very
picturesque: the Mont des Cats, the Mont
Rouge, and the Mont Noir made a framework
for the heavy, motionless clouds of an
old Dutch painting.  The peasants' houses
with their weather-beaten, thatched roofs
faded into the surrounding fields; their dull
walls had turned the colour of yellow clay.
The grey shutters bordered with green
struck the only vivid and human note in
this kingdom of the earth.</p>
<p>The colonel pointed with his cane to a
new mine crater; but Major Parker, sticking
to his point, went on with his favourite
subject:</p>
<p>"The greatest service which sport has
rendered us is that it has saved us from
intellectual culture.  Luckily one hasn't
time for everything, and golf and tennis
cut out reading.  We are stupid——"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, major!" said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"We are stupid," emphatically repeated
Major Parker, who hated being contradicted,
"and it is a great asset.  When we are in
danger we don't notice it, because we don't
reflect; so we keep cool and come out of
it nearly always with honour."</p>
<p>"Always," amended Colonel Bramble
with his Scotch curtness.</p>
<p>And Aurelle, hopping agilely over the
enormous ruts by the side of these two
Goliaths, realized more clearly than ever
that this war would end well.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER II</strong></p>
<p>"Clear the table," said Colonel
Bramble to the orderlies.  "Bring
the rum, a lemon, some sugar
and hot water, and keep some more boiling.
Then tell my batman to give me the
gramophone and the box of records."</p>
<p>This gramophone, a gift to the Highlanders
from a very patriotic old lady, was the
colonel's pride.  He had it carried about
after him everywhere and treated it with
delicate care, feeding it every month with
fresh records.</p>
<p>"Messiou," he said to Aurelle, "what
would you like?  'The Bing Boys,' 'Destiny
Waltz,' or 'Caruso.'"</p>
<p>Major Parker and Dr. O'Grady solemnly
consigned Edison and all his works to a
hotter place; the padre raised his eyes to
heaven.</p>
<p>"Anything you like, sir," said Aurelle,
"except 'Caruso.'"</p>
<p>"Why?" said the colonel.  "It's a very
good record, it cost twenty-two shillings.
But first of all you must hear my dear
Mrs. Finzi-Magrini in 'La Tosca.'  Doctor,
please regulate it, I can't see very
well—Speed 61.  Don't scratch the record, for
God's sake!"</p>
<p>He sank down on his biscuit boxes,
arranged his back comfortably against a heap
of sacks, and shut his eyes.  His rugged
face relaxed.  The padre and the doctor
were playing chess, and Major Parker was
filling in long returns for brigade
headquarters.  Over a little wood, torn to bits
by shells, an aeroplane was sailing home
among fleecy white clouds in a lovely
pale-green sky.  Aurelle began a letter.</p>
<p>"Padre," said the doctor, "if you are
going to the division to-morrow, ask them
to send me some blankets for our dead
Boches.  You saw the one we buried this
morning?  The rats had half eaten him.
It's indecent.  Check to the king."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the padre, "and it's curious
how they always begin at the nose!"</p>
<p>Over their heads a heavy English battery
began to bombard the German line.  The
padre smiled broadly.</p>
<p>"There'll be dirty work at the cross roads
to-night," he remarked with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Padre," said the doctor, "are you not
the minister of a religion of peace and love?"</p>
<p>"The Master said, my boy, that one
must love one's fellow-man.  He never said
that we must love Germans.  I take your
knight."</p>
<p>The Reverend John MacIvor, an old
military chaplain, with a face bronzed by
Eastern suns, took to this life of war and
horrors with the enthusiasm of a child.
When the men were in the trenches he
visited them every morning with his pockets
bulging with hymn-books and packets of
cigarettes.  While resting behind the lines,
he tried his hand at bombing and deplored
the fact that his cloth forbade him human
targets.</p>
<p>Major Parker suddenly stopped his work to
curse Brass Hats and their absurd questions.</p>
<p>"When I was in the Himalayas at
Chitral," he said, "some red-hats sent us a
ridiculous scheme for manoeuvres; among
other details the artillery had to cross a
rocky defile hardly wide enough for a very
thin man.</p>
<p>"I wired, 'Scheme received; send
immediately a hundred barrels of vinegar.'  'Report
yourself to the P.M.O. for mental
examination,' courteously remarked headquarters.
'Re-read "Hannibal's Campaign,"'
I replied."</p>
<p>"You really sent that telegram?" asked
Aurelle.  "In the French army you would
have been court-martialled."</p>
<p>"That's because our two nations have not
the same idea of liberty," said the major.
"To us the inalienable rights of man are
humour, sport, and primogeniture."</p>
<p>"At the headquarters of the brigade,"
said the padre, "there is a captain who
must have had lessons from you in military
correspondence.  The other day, as I had
no news of one of my young chaplains who
had left us about a month, I sent a note to
the brigade: 'The Reverend C. Carlisle
was invalided on September 12th.  I should
like to know if he is better, and if he has
been given a new appointment.'  The reply
from the hospital said simply: '1. Condition
unchanged.  2. Ultimate destination
unknown.'  The officer in transmitting it to
me had added, 'It is not clear whether the
last paragraph refers to the unit to which
the Rev. C. Carlisle will be eventually
attached, or to his eternal welfare.'"</p>
<p>The Italian air came to an end with a
triumphant roulade.</p>
<p>"What a voice!" said the colonel,
opening his eyes regretfully.</p>
<p>He carefully stopped the record and put
it affectionately in its case.</p>
<p>"Now, messiou, I am going to play
'Destiny Waltz.'"</p>
<p>One could just see outside the Verey
lights gently rising and falling.  The padre
and the doctor went on describing their
corpses while carefully manoeuvring the
ivory pieces of the little set of chessmen;
the howitzers and machine-guns broke into
the voluptuous rhythm of the waltz,
creating a sort of fantastic symphony highly
appreciated by Aurelle.  He continued to
write his letter in easy verses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"La Mort passe; le Destin chante;</p>
<p>Vite, oublie-moi.</p>
<p>Tes robes noires sont charmantes;</p>
<p>Mets-les six mois.</p>
<p>Garde-toi de venir en pleurs</p>
<p>M'offrir des roses;</p>
<p>Aux vivants réserve tes fleurs</p>
<p>Et toutes choses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Il ne faut pas m'en vouloir, mon amie, si je
tourne an plus plat des romantismes: un clergyman
et un médecin, à côte de moi, s'obstinent à
jouer les fossoyeurs d'Hamlet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ne me plains pas, je dormirai</p>
<p>Sans barcaroles,</p>
<p>Et de mon corps je nourrirai</p>
<p>Des herbes folles.</p>
<p>Mais si, par quelque soir d'automne</p>
<p>On de brouillard,</p>
<p>Pour ton visage de madone</p>
<p>Tu veux le fard.</p>
<p>De cet air de mélancolie</p>
<p>Que j'aimais tant,</p>
<p>Alors oublie que tu m'oublies</p>
<p>Pour un instant."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Do you like my waltz, messiou?" said
the colonel.</p>
<p>"Very much indeed, sir," said Aurelle
sincerely.</p>
<p>The colonel gave him a grateful smile.</p>
<p>"I'll play it again for you, messiou.
Doctor, regulate the gramophone slower,
speed 59.  Don't scratch the record.  For
<emphasis>you</emphasis>, this time, messiou."</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER III</strong></p>
<p>BOSWELL.  "Why then, sir, did he talk so?"</p>
<p>JOHNSON.  "Why, sir, to make you answer as you did."</p>
<p>The batteries were asleep; Major
Parker was answering questions
from the brigade; the orderlies
brought the rum, sugar and boiling water;
the colonel put the gramophone to speed
61, and Dr. O'Grady talked about the
Russian Revolution.</p>
<p>"It is unprecedented," said he, "for the
men who made a revolution to remain in
power after it is over.  Yet one still finds
revolutionaries: that proves how badly
history is taught."</p>
<p>"Parker," said the colonel, "pass the
port."</p>
<p>"Ambition," said Aurelle, "is after all
not the only motive that inspires men to
action.  One can be a revolutionary from
hatred of a tyrant, from jealousy, or even
from the love of humanity."</p>
<p>Major Parker abandoned his papers.</p>
<p>"I admire France very much, Aurelle,
especially since this war; but one thing
shocks me in your country, if you will allow
me to speak plainly, and that is your jealousy
of equality.  When I read the history of
your Revolution I am sorry I was not there
to kick Robespierre and that horrible fellow
Hébert.  And your <emphasis>sans-culottes</emphasis>.  Well,
that makes me long to dress up in purple
satin and gold lace and walk about the
Place de la Concorde."</p>
<p>The doctor allowed a particularly acute
attack of hysteria on the part of Madame
Finzi-Magrini to pass, and went on:</p>
<p>"The love of humanity is a pathological
state of a sexual origin which often appears
at the age of puberty in nervous and clever
people.  The excess of phosphorus in the
system must get out somewhere.  As for
hatred of a tyrant, that is a more human
sentiment which has full play in time of
war, when force and the mob are one.
Emperors must be mad fools to decide on
declaring wars which substitute an armed
nation for their Prætorian Guards.  That
idiocy accomplished, despotism of course
produces revolution until terrorism leads to
the inevitable reaction."</p>
<p>"You condemn us then, doctor, to oscillate
between rebellion and a <emphasis>coup d'état</emphasis>?"</p>
<p>"No," said the doctor, "because the
English people, who have already given
the world Stilton cheese and comfortable
chairs, have invented for our benefit the
Parliamentary system.  Our M.P.'s arrange
rebellions and <emphasis>coups d'état</emphasis> for us, which
leaves the rest of the nation time to play
cricket.  The Press completes the system
by enabling us to take our share in these
tumults by proxy.  All these things form
a part of modern comfort and in a hundred
years' time every man, white, yellow, red
or black, will refuse to inhabit a room
without hot water laid on, or a country
without a Parliament.</p>
<p>"I hope you are wrong," said Major
Parker.  "I hate politicians, and I want,
after the War, to go and live in the East,
because nobody out there pays any attention
to a government of babblers."</p>
<p>"My dear major, why the devil do you
mix your personal feelings with these
questions?  Politics are controlled by laws as
necessary as the movements of the stars.
Are you annoyed that there are dark nights
because you happen to prefer moonlight?
Humanity lies on an uncomfortable bed.
When the sleeper aches too much he turns
over, that is a war or an insurrection.  Then
he goes to sleep again for a few centuries.
All that is quite natural and happens without
much suffering, if one does not mix up
any moral ideas with it.  Attacks of cramp
are not virtues.  But each change finds,
alas, its prophets who, from love of
humanity, as Aurelle says, put this
miserable globe to fire and sword."</p>
<p>"That's very well said, doctor," said
Aurelle, "but I return the compliment;
if those are your sentiments, why do you
take the trouble to belong to a party?
Because you are a damned socialist."</p>
<p>"Doctor," said the colonel, "pass the
port."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the doctor, "that's because I
would rather be persecutor than persecuted.
You must know how to recognize the
arrival of these periodical upheavals and
prepare.  This war will bring socialism,
that is to say, the total sacrifice of the
aristocrat to the Leviathan.  This in itself is
neither a blessing nor a misfortune: it is
cramp.  Let us then turn over with a good
grace, as long as we feel we shall be more
comfortable on the other side."</p>
<p>"That's a perfectly absurd theory," said
Major Parker, angrily sticking out his
square chin, "and if you adopt it, doctor,
you must give up medicine!  Why try and
stop the course of diseases?  They are also,
according to you, periodic and necessary
upheavals.  But if you pretend to fight
against tuberculosis do not deny me the
right to attack universal suffrage."</p>
<p>At this moment a R.A.M.C. sergeant
entered and asked Dr. O'Grady to come
and see a wounded man: Major Parker
remained master of the situation.  The
colonel, who had a horror of arguments,
seized the opportunity to talk about
something else.</p>
<p>"Messiou," he said, "what is the displacement
of one of your largest cruisers?"</p>
<p>"Sixty thousand tons, sir," hazarded
Aurelle wildly.</p>
<p>This knock-out blow put the colonel
out of action, and Aurelle asked Major
Parker why he objected to universal suffrage.</p>
<p>"But don't you see, my dear Aurelle,
that it is the most extravagant idea that
humanity has ever conceived?  Our
political system will be considered more
monstrous than slavery in a thousand years.
One man, one vote, whatever the man is!
Do you pay the same price for a good horse
as for a crock?"</p>
<p>"Have you ever heard the immortal
reasoning of our Courteline?  'Why should
I pay twelve francs for an umbrella when I
can get a glass of beer for six sous?'"</p>
<p>"Equal rights for men!" continued the
major vehemently.  "Why not equal courage
and equal intelligence while you are
about it?"</p>
<p>Aurelle loved the major's impassioned
and pleasant harangues and, to keep the
discussion going, said that he did not see
how one could refuse a people the right to
choose their leaders.</p>
<p>"To control them, Aurelle, yes; but to
choose them, never!  An aristocracy cannot
be elected.  It is or it isn't.  Why, if I
were to attempt to choose the Commander-in-Chief
or the Superintendent of Guy's
Hospital I should be shut up; but, if I
wish to have a voice in the election of
the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the
First Lord of the Admiralty, I'm a good
citizen!"</p>
<p>"That is not quite correct, major.  Ministers
are not elected.  Mind, I agree with
you that our political system is imperfect;
but so are all human affairs.  And then,
'<emphasis>La pire des Chambres vaut mieux que la
meilleure des antichambres</emphasis>.'"</p>
<p>"I piloted round London lately," replied
the major, "an Arab chief who honoured
me with his friendship, and when I had
shown him the House of Commons and
explained what went on there, he
remarked, 'It must give you a lot of
trouble cutting off those six hundred
heads when you are not pleased with the
Government.'"</p>
<p>"Messiou," said the colonel, exasperated.
"I am going to play 'Destiny Waltz' for
you."</p>
<p>*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p>Major Parker remained silent while the
waltz unrolled its rhythmic phrases, but he
ruminated over his old resentment against
that "horrible fellow Hébert" and, as soon
as the record had ground out its final notes,
he started a new attack on Aurelle.</p>
<p>"What advantage," he said, "could the
French have found in changing their
government eight times in a century?
Revolutions have become a national
institution with you.  In England, it would be
impossible.  If a crowd collected at
Westminster and made a disturbance, the
policeman would tell them to go away and they
would do so."</p>
<p>"What an idea!" said Aurelle, who did
not like Revolutions, but who thought he
ought to defend an old French lady
against this hot-headed Saxon.  "You
must not forget, major, that you also cut
off your King's head.  No policeman intervened
to save Charles Stuart, as far as I
know."</p>
<p>"The assassination of Charles I," said
the major, "was the sole work of Oliver
Cromwell; now Oliver was a very good
cavalry colonel, but he knew nothing of
the real feelings of the English people,
which they showed pretty plainly at the
time of the Restoration.</p>
<p>"Cromwell's head, which had been
embalmed, was stuck on a pike on the top
of Westminster Hall.  One stormy night
the wind broke the shaft of the pike and
the head rolled to the feet of a sentry.  He
took it home and hid it in the chimney
of his house, where it remained until his
death.  It passed through various hands till
it came into the possession of a friend of
mine, and I have often sat at tea opposite
the head of the Protector still on its
broken pike.  One could easily recognize
the wart which he had on his forehead
and there still remains a lock of chestnut
hair."</p>
<p>"Humph," grunted the colonel, at last
interested in the conversation.</p>
<p>"Besides," continued the major, "the
English Revolution does not compare in
any way with the French one: it did not
weaken the ruling classes.  As a matter
of fact, all the bad business of 1789 was
caused by Louis XIV.  Instead of leaving
your country the strong armour of a landed
gentry he made his nobles into the ridiculous
puppets of Versailles, whose sole
business was to hand him his coat and his
waistcoat.  In destroying the prestige of a
class which should be the natural supporters
of the monarchy, he ruined it beyond repair,
and more's the pity."</p>
<p>"It is very easy for you to criticize us,"
said Aurelle.  "We made our Revolution
for you: the most important event in
English history is the taking of the Bastille,
and well you know it."</p>
<p>"Bravo, messiou," said the colonel, "stick
up for your country.  One ought always to
stick up for one's country.  Now please
pass the port.  I am going to play you
'The Mikado.'"</p>

<p>[#] "Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag."</p>
<p>Grey dawn is breaking over the spongy
plain.  To-day will be the same as yesterday,
to-morrow like to-day.  The doctor
will wave his arms and say, "Très triste,
messiou," and he will not know what is sad,
no more shall I.  Then he will give me
a humorous lecture in a style between
Bernard Shaw and the Bible.</p>
<p>The padre will write letters, play patience
and go out riding.  The guns will thunder,
Boches will be killed, some of our men too.
We shall lunch off bully beef and boiled
potatoes, the beer will be horrible and the
colonel will say to me, "Bière française no
bonne, messiou."</p>
<p>In the evening, after a dinner of badly
cooked mutton, with mint sauce, and boiled
potatoes, the inevitable gramophone will
appear.  We shall have "The Arcadians,"
"The Mikado," then "Destiny Waltz"—"pour
vous, messiou"—and "Mrs. Finzi-Magrini"
for the colonel, and finally "The
Lancashire Ramble."  Unfortunately for
me, the first time that I heard this circus
tune I imitated a juggler catching balls in
time to the music.  This little comedy
henceforth took its place in the traditions
of the Mess, and if this evening at the first
notes of the "Ramble" I should forget to
play my part the colonel will say, "Allons,
messiou, allons," pretending to juggle, but
I know my duty and I shall not forget; for
Colonel Bramble only cares for familiar
scenes and fine old crusted jokes.</p>
<p>His favourite number is a recitation by
O'Grady of "Going on leave."  When he
is in a bad temper, when one of his old
friends has been made a brigadier-general,
or been given a C.B., this recitation is the
only thing that can make him smile.  He
knows it by heart and, like the children,
stops the doctor if he misses a sentence or
alters a reply.</p>
<p>"No, doctor, no; the Naval officer said
to you, 'When you hear four loud short
whistles, it means that the ship has been
torpedoed,' and you replied, 'And what if
the torpedo carries away the whistle?'"</p>
<p>The doctor, having found his place,
goes on.</p>
<p>Parker, too, one day found a remark
which ever afterwards had a brilliant success.
He got it out of a letter that a chaplain had
written to the <emphasis>Times</emphasis>.  "The life of the
soldier," wrote this excellent man, "is one
of great hardship; not infrequently mingled
with moments of real danger."</p>
<p>The colonel thoroughly enjoys the unconscious
humour of this remark, and would
quote it whenever a shell scattered gravel
over him.  But his great resource, if the
conversation bores him, is to attack the
padre on his two weak points: bishops
and Scotchmen.</p>
<p>The padre, who comes from the Highlands,
is madly patriotic.  He is convinced
that it is only Scotchmen who play the
game and who are really killed.</p>
<p>"If history told the truth," he says, "this
war would not be called the European War,
but the war between Scotland and Germany."</p>
<p>The colonel is Scotch himself, but he is
fair, and every time he finds in the papers
the casualty lists of the Irish Guards or the
Welsh Fusiliers he reads them out in a loud
voice to the padre, who, to keep his end
up, maintains that the Welsh Fusiliers and
Irish Guards are recruited in Aberdeen.
This is his invariable retort.</p>
<p>All this may appear rather puerile to you,
my friend, but these childish things are the
only bright spots in our boring, bombarded
existence.  Yes, these wonderful men have
remained children in many ways; they have
the fresh outlook, and the inordinate love of
games, and our rustic shelter often seems to
me like a nursery of heroes.</p>
<p>But I have profound faith in them; their
profession of empire-builders has inspired
them with high ideals of the duty of the
white man.  The colonel and Parker are
"Sahibs" whom nothing on earth would
turn from the path they have chosen.  To
despise danger, to stand firm under fire, is
not an act of courage in their eyes—it is
simply part of their education.  If a small
dog stands up to a big one they say gravely,
"He is a gentleman."</p>
<p>A true gentleman, you see, is very nearly
the most sympathetic type which evolution
has produced among the pitiful group of
creatures who are at this moment making
such a noise in the world.  Amid the horrible
wickedness of the species, the English have
established an oasis of courtesy and phlegm.
I love them.</p>
<p>I must add that it is a very foolish error
to imagine that they are less intelligent than
ourselves, in spite of the delight my friend
Major Parker pretends to take in affirming
the contrary.  The truth is that their
intelligence follows a different method from
ours.  Far removed from our standard of
rationalism and the pedantic sentiment of
the Germans, they delight in a vigorous
common sense and all absence of system.
Hence a natural and simple manner which
makes their sense of humour still more
delightful.</p>
<p>But I see, from the window, my horse
waiting for me; and I must go round to the
surly farmers and get some straw for the
quartermaster, who is trying to build stables.
But <emphasis>you</emphasis> are furnishing boudoirs, and mind
you choose, oh, Amazon, soft, oriental silks.</p>

<p>"Are you a poet?" the colonel asked me
doubtfully, when he saw me writing lines of
equal length.</p>
<p>I denied the soft impeachment.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER V</strong></p>
<p>It had been raining for four days.  The
heavy raindrops played a monotonous
tattoo on the curved roof of
the tent.  Outside in the field the grass had
disappeared under yellow mud, in which
the men's footsteps sounded like the
smacking of a giant's lips.</p>
<p>"'And God looked upon the earth, and
behold, it was corrupt,'" recited the padre;
"'and God said to Noah, Make thee an ark
of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in
the ark, and shalt pitch it within and
without with pitch.  The same day were all
the fountains of the great deep broken up,
and the windows of heaven were opened,'"
continued the doctor.</p>
<p>"The Flood," he added, "was a real
event, for its description is common to
all oriental mythology.  No doubt the
Euphrates had burst its banks; that's why
the Ark was driven into the interior and
came to rest on a hill.  Similar catastrophes
often occur in Mesopotamia and in India,
but are rare in Belgium."</p>
<p>"The cyclone of 1876 killed 215,000
people in Bengal," said the colonel.
"Messiou, send round the port, please."</p>
<p>The colonel loved statistics, to the great
misfortune of Aurelle, who, quite incapable
of remembering figures, was interrogated
every day on the number of inhabitants in
a village, the strength of the Serbian army,
or the initial velocity of the French bullet.
He foresaw with terror that the colonel was
going to ask him the average depth of rain
in feet and inches in Flanders, and he
hastened to create a diversion.</p>
<p>"I found in Poperinghe," he said, showing
the book he was reading, "this very
curious old volume.  It is a description
of England and Scotland by the Frenchman,
Etienne Perlin, Paris, 1558."</p>
<p>"Humph!  What does this Mr. Perlin
say?" asked the colonel, who had the same
respect for ancient things as he had for old
soldiers.</p>
<p>Aurelle opened the book at hazard and
translated:</p>
<p>"'After dinner, the cloth is withdrawn
and the ladies retire.  The table is of
beautiful glossy Indian wood, and stands
of the same wood hold the bottles.  The
name of each wine is engraved on a silver
plate which hangs by a little chain round
the neck of the bottle.  The guests each
choose the wine they like and drink it as
seriously as if they were doing penance,
while proposing the health of eminent
personages or the fashionable beauties; this
is what is known as a toast.'"</p>
<p>"I like 'fashionable beauties,'" said the
doctor.  "Perhaps Aurelle will take to
drinking port, now he can pour libations to
Gaby Deslys or Gladys Cooper."</p>
<p>"There are toasts for each day in the
week," said the colonel, "Monday, our
men; Tuesday, ourselves; Wednesday, our
swords; Thursday, sport; Friday, our
religion; Saturday, sweethearts and wives;
Sunday, absent friends and ships at
sea."</p>
<p>Aurelle went on reading aloud:</p>
<p>"'These toasts are of barbaric origin, and
I have been told that the Highlanders of
Scotland, a semi-savage folk who live in a
state of perpetual feud——'"</p>
<p>"Listen to that, padre," said the colonel.
"Read it again, messiou, for the padre,
have been told that the Highlanders of
Scotland——'"</p>
<p>"A semi-savage folk who live in a state
of perpetual feud, have kept to the original
character of this custom.  To drink the
health of anyone is to ask him to guard
you while you drink and cannot defend
yourself; and the person to whom you
drink replies, "I pledge you," which means
in their language, "I guarantee your safety."  Then
he draws his dagger, places the point
on the table and protects you until your
glass is empty.'"</p>
<p>"That's why," said Major Parker, "the
pewter pots that they give for golf prizes
have always got glass bottoms through
which one can see the dagger of the
assassin."</p>
<p>"Send round the port, messiou, I want
to drink the padre's health in a second glass
to hear him reply, 'I pledge you,' and to
see him put the point of his dagger on the
table."</p>
<p>"I've only got a Swiss knife," said the
padre.</p>
<p>"That's good enough," said the colonel.</p>
<p>"This theory of the origin of toasts is
very probable," said the doctor.  "We are
always repeating ancestral signs which are
quite useless now.  When a great actress
wants to express hate she draws back her
charming lips and shows her canine teeth,
an unconscious sign of cannibalism.  We
shake hands with a friend to prevent him
using it to strike us, and we take off our
hats because our ancestors used to humbly
offer their heads, to the bigwigs of those
days, to be cut off."</p>
<p>At that moment there was a loud crack,
and Colonel Bramble fell backwards with a
crash.  One of the legs of his chair had
broken.  The doctor and Parker helped him
up, while Aurelle and the padre looked on
in fits of laughter.</p>
<p>"There's a good example of an ancestral
survival," said the major, kindly intervening
to save Aurelle, who was trying in vain to
stop laughing.  "I imagine that one laughs
at a fall because the death of a man was one
of the most amusing sights for our ancestors.
It delivered them from an adversary and
diminished the number of those who shared
the food and the females."</p>
<p>"Now we know you, messiou," said the colonel.</p>
<p>"A French philosopher," said Aurelle,
who had by this time recovered, "has constructed
quite a different theory of laughter:
he is called Bergson and——"</p>
<p>"I have heard of him," said the padre;
"he's a clergyman, isn't he?"</p>
<p>"I have a theory about laughter," said
the doctor, "which is much more edifying
than yours, major.  I think it is simply
produced by a feeling of horror, immediately
succeeded by a feeling of relief.  A young
monkey who is devoted to the old father of
the tribe sees him slip on a banana skin, he
fears an accident and his chest swells with
fright, then he discovers that it's nothing
and all his muscles pleasantly relax.  That
was the first joke, and it explains the
convulsive motions in laughing.  Aurelle is
shaken physically because he is shaken
morally by two strong motives: his anxious
affection and respect for the colonel——"</p>
<p>"Ugh," grunted the colonel.</p>
<p>"And the consoling certainty that he is
not hurt."</p>
<p>"I wish you would talk about something
else," said the colonel.  "Read a little more
of the book, messiou."</p>
<p>Aurelle turned over some pages.</p>
<p>"'Other nations,'" he read, "'accuse the
English of incivility because they arrive and
depart without touching their hats, and
without that flow of compliments which
are common to the French and Italians.
But those who judge thus see things in a
false light.  The English idea is that politeness
does not consist in gestures or words
which are often hypocritical and deceptive,
but in being courteously disposed to other
people.  They have their faults like every
nation, but, considering everything, I am
sure that the more one knows them the
more one esteems and likes them.'"</p>
<p>"I like old Mr. Perlin," said the colonel.
"Do you agree with him, messiou?"</p>
<p>"The whole of France now agrees with
him, sir," said Aurelle warmly.</p>
<p>"You are biased, Aurelle," said Major
Parker, "because you are getting quite
English yourself.  You whistle in your
bath, you drink whisky and are beginning
to like arguments; if you could only manage
to eat tomatoes and underdone cutlets for
breakfast you would be perfect."</p>
<p>"If you don't mind, major, I would rather
remain French," said Aurelle.  "Besides, I
never knew that whistling in one's bath was
an English rite."</p>
<p>"So much so," said the doctor, "that I
have arranged to have carved on my tombstone:
'Here lies a British subject who
never whistled in his bath or tried to be an
amateur detective.'"</p>

<p><strong>CHAPTER VI</strong></p>
<p>British conversation is like a game
of cricket or a boxing match;
personal allusions are forbidden
like hitting below the belt, and anyone
who loses his temper is disqualified.</p>
<p>Aurelle met at the Lennox Mess veterinaries
and generals, tradesmen and dukes.
Excellent whisky was provided and the
guests entertained in a friendly way without
boring them with too much attention.</p>
<p>"It rains a lot in your country," said a
major in the Engineers who sat next him
one evening.</p>
<p>"So it does in England," said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"I intend," said the major, "when this
damned war is over, to leave the army and
go and live in New Zealand."</p>
<p>"You have friends there?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, but the salmon fishing is very
good."</p>
<p>"Bring your rod over here while we are
resting, major, the pond is full of enormous
pike."</p>
<p>"I never fish for pike," said the major,
"he is not a gentleman.  When he sees he
is caught he gives up; the salmon fights
to the end, even without hope.  A thirty-pound
fellow will sometimes fight two
hours; that's something like, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Admirable!" said Aurelle.  "And
what about trout?"</p>
<p>"The trout is a lady," said the major;
"you must deceive her; but it is not easy,
because she is a judge of flies.  And you,"
he added politely, after a short silence,
"what do you do in peace time?"</p>
<p>"I write a little," said Aurelle, "and I
am trying for a degree."</p>
<p>"No, no; I mean what is your sport—fishing,
hunting, golf, polo?"</p>
<p>"To tell the truth," acknowledged
Aurelle, "I am not much good at sport.
I am not very strong and——"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to hear that," said the major,
but he turned to his other neighbour and
bothered no more about the Frenchman.</p>
<p>Aurelle was thrown back on the Veterinary
Captain Clarke sitting on his left, who
had up to then been eating and drinking
without saying a word.</p>
<p>"It rains a lot in your country," said
Captain Clarke.</p>
<p>"So it does in England," said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"I intend," said Clarke, "when this
damned war is over to go back to Santa
Lucia."</p>
<p>Aurelle asked if the captain's family lived
in the Antilles.</p>
<p>He was horrified.</p>
<p>"Oh, no!  I belong to a Staffordshire
family.  I went out there quite by chance;
I was travelling for pleasure and my boat
touched at Santa Lucia; I found the heat
very agreeable and I stayed there.  I
bought some land very cheap and I grow
cocoa."</p>
<p>"And it does not bore you?"</p>
<p>"No, the nearest white man is six miles
off, and the coast of the island is excellent
for sailing.  What more could I do at
home?  When I go to England for three
months' holiday, I spend a week at my old
home, then I go off in a yacht alone.  I
have been all round your Brittany coast;
it is delightful because the currents are so
difficult and your charts are so good; but
it is not warm enough.  At Santa Lucia
I can smoke cigarettes in my pyjamas on
my veranda."</p>
<p>He slowly swallowed his port and concluded:</p>
<p>"No, I don't like Europe—too much
work.  But, out there, there is enough food
for everybody."</p>
<p>The colonel at the other end of the table
was holding forth about India, the white
ponies of his regiment, the native servants
with their complicated names and varied
duties, and the lax life in the Hills.  Parker
described hunting on an elephant.</p>
<p>"You stand up on your animal firmly
tied on by one leg, and when the elephant
gallops you fly into space: it's really most
exciting."</p>
<p>"I'll take your word for it," said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"Yes, but if you try it," said the colonel
solicitously to Aurelle, "don't forget to
slide off by the tail as quickly as you can
if the elephant comes to marshy ground.
His instinct, when the ground gives way
beneath him, is to seize you in his trunk
and put you down in front of him to have
something solid to kneel on."</p>
<p>"I'll remember, sir," said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"In the Malay States," said the major
of Engineers, "the wild elephants wander
about the main roads.  I often met them
when I was on my motor-bike; if your face
or your clothes annoy them they pick you
off and smash your head by treading on
it.  But except for that they are quite
inoffensive."</p>
<p>A long discussion on the most vulnerable
part of an elephant followed.  The padre
showed his knowledge by explaining how
the anatomy of the Indian elephant differed
from that of the African species.</p>
<p>"Padre," said Aurelle, "I always knew
you were a sportsman; but have you ever
really done any big game shooting?"</p>
<p>"What! my dear fellow?  Big game?
I've killed pretty nearly everything a hunter
<emphasis>can</emphasis> kill, from the elephant and rhinoceros
to the lion and tiger.  I've never told you
the story of my first lion?"</p>
<p>"Never, padre," said the doctor, "but
you are going to now."</p>
<p>"Padre," said the colonel, "I should
like to hear your stories, but I make one
condition: some one must start the
gramophone for me.  I want my dear
'Mrs. Finzi-Magrini' to-night."</p>
<p>"Oh no, sir, for pity's sake!  I'll let you
have a rag-time if you absolutely must
grind that damned machine."</p>
<p>"Not at all, doctor, you aren't going to
get off so easily.  I insist on
'Finzi-Magrini.'  Come, Aurelle, like a good chap, and
remember, speed 65, and don't scratch my
record.  Padre, you may now begin the
story of your first lion."</p>
<p>"I was at Johannesburg and very much
wanted to join a sporting club, as a number
of the members were friends of mine.  But
the rules did not admit any candidate who
had not at least killed a lion.  So I set out
with a nigger loaded with several rifles, and
that evening lay in wait with him near a
water-hole where a lion was accustomed to
come and drink.</p>
<p>"Half an hour before midnight I heard
the crashing of branches and over the top of
a bush appeared the head of a lion.  He had
winded us and looked our way.  I aimed
and fired.  The head disappeared behind
the bush, but appeared again after a minute.
A second shot, the same result.  The brute
got frightened, hid his head and then put it
up again.  I remained quite cool, I had sixteen
shots to fire in my various rifles.  Third
shot, same old game; fourth shot, ditto.</p>
<p>"I got unnerved and shot badly, so that
after the fifteenth shot the beast put up his
head again.  'Miss that one, him eat us,'
said the nigger.  I took a long breath, aimed
carefully and fired.  The animal fell.  One
second—two—ten—he did not reappear.  I
waited a little longer, then I rushed out
followed by my nigger, and guess, messiou,
what I found behind."</p>
<p>"The lion, padre."</p>
<p>"<emphasis>Sixteen</emphasis> lions, my boy, and every one
had a bullet in its eye!  That's how I made
my debut."</p>
<p>"By Jove, padre!  Who says the Scotch
have no imagination?"</p>
<p>"Now listen to a true story.  It was in
India that I first killed a woman.  Yes, yes,
a woman!  I had set out tiger-shooting
when in passing through a village, buried
in the jungle, an old native stopped me.
'Sahib, sahib, a bear!'  And he pointed
out a moving black shape up a tree.  I
took aim quickly and fired.  The mass fell
heavily with a crashing of branches, and I
discovered an old woman, whom I had
demolished while she was picking fruit.
Another old nigger, the husband,
overwhelmed me with abuse.  They went and
fetched the native policeman.  I had to
buy off the family; it cost a terrible lot, at
least two pounds.</p>
<p>"The story soon got about for twenty
miles round, and for several weeks I could
not go through a village without two or
three old men rushing at me and crying,
'Sahib, sahib, a bear up the tree!'  I need
hardly tell you that they had just made their
wives climb up."</p>
<p>Then Parker described a crocodile hunt,
and Captain Clarke gave some details about
sharks in Bermuda, which are not dangerous
as long as people take the precaution of
jumping into the water in company.  The
colonel, meanwhile, played "The March of
the Lost Brigade" in slow time.  The New
Zealand major put some eucalyptus leaves
in the fire so that the smell might remind
him of the Bush.  Aurelle, rather dazed,
fuddled with the Indian sun and the scent
of wild animals, at last realized that this
world is a great park laid out by a gardener
god for the gentlemen of the United Kingdoms.</p>

<p>Mais quand je suis ainsi rêveur et paresseux,</p>
<p>Quand il pleut dans mon coeur comme il pleut dans——</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"Aurelle," said the doctor, "this time
you <emphasis>are</emphasis> writing verses; deny it if you can.
You are taken red-handed."</p>
<p>"M-ph!" grunted the colonel scornfully,
but with indulgence.</p>
<p>"I own to it, doctor, but what then?  Is
it contrary to King's Regulations?"</p>
<p>"No," said the doctor, "but I'm surprised.
I have always been convinced that
the French cannot be a nation of poets.
Poetry is rhymed foolishness.  Now you
are not a fool, and you have no sense of
rhythm."</p>
<p>"You do not know our poets," said
Aurelle, annoyed.  "Have you read Musset,
Hugo, Baudelaire?"</p>
<p>"I know Hugo," said the colonel.  "When
I commanded the troops in Guernsey I
was shown his house.  I also tried to read
his book, 'The Toilers of the Sea,' but it
was too boring."</p>
<p>The arrival of Major Parker, pushing in
front of him two boyish-looking captains,
put an end to this conference.</p>
<p>"Here are young Gibbons and Warburton.
You must give them a cup of tea
before sending them back to their
companies.  I found them sitting on the side
of the Zillebeke Road, no doubt waiting
for a taxi.  These London people will
expect anything."</p>
<p>Gibbons was returning from leave, and
Warburton, a dark Welshman very like a
Frenchman, who had been wounded two
months before in Artois, was rejoining the
Lennox after sick leave.</p>
<p>"Aurelle, give me a cup of tea like a
good fellow," said Major Parker.  "Oh,
the milk first, I beseech you!  And ask
for a whisky and soda to wake up Captain
Gibbons, will you?  He looks as if he had
just come out of his wigwam and had not
dug up his war hatchet yet."</p>
<p>"It's such a horrible change," said
Gibbons.  "Yesterday morning I was still
in my garden in a real English valley, with
hedges and trees.  Everything was clean
and fresh and cared-for and happy.  My
pretty sisters-in-law were playing tennis.
We were all dressed in white, and here I
am suddenly transported into this dreadful
mangled wood among you band of assassins.
When <emphasis>do</emphasis> you think this damned war will
be over?  I am such a peaceable man!  I
prefer church bells to guns and the piano
to a Hotchkiss.  My one ambition is to
live in the country with my plump little
wife and a lot of plump little children."  And,
raising his glass, he concluded, "I
drink to the end of these follies, and to hell
with the Boches who brought us here!"</p>
<p>But keen Warburton cut in immediately.</p>
<p>"I like the War.  It is only War that
gives us a normal existence.  What do you
do in peace-time?  You stay at home; you
don't know what to do with your time;
you argue with your parents, and your
wife—if you have one.  Everyone thinks you
are an insufferable egotist—and so you are.
The War comes; you only go home every
five or six months.  You are a hero, and,
what women appreciate much more, you
are a change.  You know stories that have
never been published.  You've seen strange
men and terrible things.  Your father,
instead of telling his friends that you are
embittering the end of his life, introduces
you to them as an oracle.  These old men
consult you on foreign politics.  If you are
married, your wife is prettier than ever;
if you are not, all the girls lay siege to
you.</p>
<p>"You like the country?  Well, you live
in a wood here.  You love your wife?  But
who was it said that it is easier to die for
the woman one loves than to live with her?
For myself I prefer a Hotchkiss to the
piano, and the chatter of my men to that
of the old ladies who come to tea at my
home.  No, Gibbons, War is a wonderful
epoch," and, holding up his glass, he said,
"I drink to the gentle Hun who procures
these pleasures for us."</p>
<p>Then he described his time at the Duchess'
hospital.</p>
<p>"I thought I was with the Queen of the
Fairies.  We got everything we wanted
without asking for it.  When our fiancées
were coming to see us, we were propped
up with cushions to match the colour of
our eyes.  A fortnight before I could get
up, they brought twelve brightly coloured
dressing-gowns for me to choose which one
I would wear the first time I was allowed
out of bed.  I chose a red and green one,
which was hung up near me, and I was in
such a hurry to put it on that I got well
three days quicker.  There was a Scotch
captain with such a beautiful wife that all
the patients' temperatures went up when
she came to see him.  They ended by
making a special door for her near her
husband's bed, so that she need not walk
down the whole ward.  Oh, I hope I shall
be wounded soon!  Doctor, promise to send
me to the Duchess' hospital!"</p>
<p>But Gibbons, with eyes still full of tender
memories of home, would not be consoled.
The padre, who was wise and kind, made
him describe the last revue at the Palace,
and complacently discussed the legs and
shoulders of a "sweet little thing."  The
colonel got out his best records and played
"Mrs. Finzi-Magrini" and "Destiny Waltz"
to his guests.  Gibbons sat with his head in
his hands during the waltz.  The colonel
was going to chaff him mildly about his
melancholy thoughts, but the little captain
got up at the end of the tune and
said:</p>
<p>"I had better be off before dark."</p>
<p>"Silly ass," said Parker, after a pause.</p>
<p>The colonel and the padre agreed.
Aurelle alone protested.</p>
<p>"Aurelle, my friend," said Dr. O'Grady,
"if you want to be thought anything of
amongst Englishmen, you must make
yourself see their point of view.  They don't
care for melancholy people, and have a
contempt for sentiment.  This applies to love
as well as to patriotism and religion.  If
you want the colonel to despise you, stick a
flag in your tunic.  If you want the padre
to treat you with contempt, give him a
letter to censor full of pious rubbish; if
you want to make Parker sick, weep over
a photograph.  They spend their youth
hardening their skins and their hearts.
They fear neither physical blows nor the
blows of fate.  They look upon exaggeration
as the worst of vices, and coldness as
a sign of aristocracy.  When they are very
miserable, they smile.  When they are very
happy, they say nothing at all.  And <emphasis>au
fond</emphasis> John Bull is terribly sentimental,
which explains everything."</p>
<p>"All that is perfectly true, Aurelle," said
Parker, "but you must not say it.  The
doctor is a confounded Irishman who
cannot hold his tongue."</p>
<p>Upon which, the doctor and Major Parker
began a discussion on the Irish question
in their usual amusingly sarcastic manner.
The colonel looked in his box of records
for "When Irish eyes are smiling," then
wisely and courteously interrupted them.</p>
<p>"And so, Aurelle," concluded Major
Parker, "you see us poor Englishmen
searching hard for the solution of a problem
when there isn't one.  You may think that
the Irish want certain definite reforms, and
that they will be happy and contented the
day they get them; but not at all.  What
amuses them is discussion itself, plotting in
theory.  They play with the idea of Home
Rule; if we gave it them, the game would
be finished and they would invent another,
probably a more dangerous one."</p>
<p>"Go to Ireland after the War, messiou,"
said the colonel, "it's an extraordinary
country.  Every one is mad.  You can
commit the worst crimes—it doesn't matter.
Nothing matters."</p>
<p>"The worst crimes?" said Aurelle, "Oh,
I say, sir!"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, anything you like—the most
unheard-of things.  You can go out hunting
in brown breeches, fish in your neighbour's
salmon river—nothing will happen; no one
will take the smallest notice of you."</p>
<p>"I do believe," said Aurelle, "that I am
beginning to understand the Irish question."</p>
<p>"I will finish your education," said the
doctor.  "A year before the War a Liberal
M.P. who was visiting Ireland said to an
old peasant, 'Well, my friend, we are soon
going to give you Home Rule!'  'God
save us, your honour,' said the man, 'do not
do that.'  'What?' said the astonished
Member.  'You don't want Home Rule
now?'  'Your honour,' said the man, 'I'll
tell you.  You are a good Christian, your
honour?  It's to heaven you want to go?
So do I, but we do not want to go there
to-night.'"</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER VIII</strong></p>
<p>CHORUS: "What, Jupiter not so strong as these goddesses?"</p>
<p>PROMETHEUS: "Yes, even he cannot escape destiny."</p>
<p>When young Lieutenant Warburton,
temporarily commanding
B Company of the Lennox
Highlanders, took over his trench, the
captain he came to relieve said to him:</p>
<p>"This part is not too unhealthy; they
are only thirty yards off, but they are tame
Boches.  All they ask is to be left alone."</p>
<p>"We will wake things up a bit," said
Warburton to his men, when the peaceable
warrior had departed.</p>
<p>When wild beasts are too well fed, they
become domesticated; but a few
well-directed rockets will make them savage
again.  In virtue of this principle, Warburton,
having provided himself with a star shell,
instead of sending it straight up fired it
horizontally towards the German trenches.</p>
<p>A distracted Saxon sentry cried, "Liquid-fire
attack!"  The Boche machine-guns
began to bark.  Warburton, delighted,
replied with grenades.  The enemy called
the artillery to its assistance.  A telephone
call, a hail of shrapnel, and immediate
reprisals by the British big guns.</p>
<p>The next day the German <emphasis>communiqué</emphasis>
said: "An attack by the British under
cover of liquid-fire at H—— was completely
checked by the combined fire of our infantry
and artillery."</p>
<p>0275 Private Scott, H.J., who served
his King and country under the strenuous
Warburton, disapproved heartily of his
officer's heroic methods.  Not that he was
a coward, but the War had taken him by
surprise when he had just married a
charming girl, and, as Captain Gadsby of the
Pink Hussars says, "a married man is only
half a man."  Scott counted the days he
spent in the trenches, and this one was the
first of ten, and his chief was reckless.</p>
<p>The god who guards lovers intervened
the next day by the simple means of a
scrap of paper asking for a man from the
regiment, mechanic by trade, to look after
a machine at P—— for disinfecting clothes.
P—— was a pretty little town at least
eight miles from the front line, rather
deserted by the inhabitants on account of
<emphasis>marmites</emphasis>, but all the same a safe and
comfortable retreat for a troglodyte of the
trenches.</p>
<p>0275 Private Scott, mechanic by trade,
put his name down.  His lieutenant abused
him; his colonel recommended him; and
his general nominated him.  An old London
omnibus painted a military grey took him
away to his new life, far from Warburton
and his perils.</p>
<p>The machine which Scott had to look
after was in the yard of a college, an old
building covered with ivy; and Abbé
Hoboken, the principal, received him, when
he arrived, as if he were a general.</p>
<p>"Are you a Catholic, my son?" he asked
him in the English of the college.</p>
<p>Luckily for Scott, he did not understand,
and answered vaguely:</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>This involuntary renunciation of the
Scotch Presbyterian Church procured him
a room belonging to a mobilized Belgian
professor and a bed with sheets.</p>
<p>Now, at that very moment, Hauptmann
Reineker, who commanded a German
battery of heavy artillery at Paschendaele,
was in a very bad temper.</p>
<p>The evening post had brought him an
ambiguous letter from his wife in which she
mentioned too often, and with an affectation
of indifference, a wounded officer of
the Guards, whom she had been nursing for
several days.</p>
<p>During the night, he surveyed his
gun-emplacements on the outskirts of a wood,
then he said suddenly:</p>
<p>"Wolfgang, have you any shells available?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"How many?"</p>
<p>"Three."</p>
<p>"Good!  Wake up Theresa's crew."</p>
<p>He then verified his calculations by his
map.</p>
<p>The men, half awake, loaded the enormous
gun.  Heineker gave the order, and,
shaking up everyone and everything, the
shell started forth, hurtling through the
night.</p>
<p>0275 Private Scott, then, who adored
his wife and had accepted a post without
honour for her sake, was sleeping peacefully
in the bedroom of a mobilized Belgian
professor: and Captain Reineker, whose
wife no longer loved him, and whom he
mistrusted, was striding furiously up and
down amongst the frozen woods; and these
two circumstances, widely apart from one
another, were developed independently in
an indifferent world.</p>
<p>Now the calculations of Reineker, like
most calculations, went wrong.  He was
400 yards out.  His landmark was the
church.  From the church to the college
was 400 yards.  A light wind increased
the deviation by 20 yards, and from that
moment the Reineker and the Scott situation
began to have points in common.  At
this particular point the chest of 0275 Private
Scott received the full force of the .305
shell, and he was blown into a thousand
bits, which, amongst other things, put an
end to the Scott situation.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER IX</strong></p>
<p>"The ideal of the English Church has been to
provide a resident gentleman for every parish in
the Kingdom, and there have been worse ideals."—SHANE LESLIE.</p>
<p>Aurelle, arriving for tea at the
Mess, found only the padre
repairing a magic lantern.</p>
<p>"Hullo, messiou," he said, "very glad to
see you.  I am getting my lantern ready
for a sporting sermon to the men of B
Company when they come out of the
trenches."</p>
<p>"What, padre, you preach sermons now
with a magic lantern?'</p>
<p>"My boy, I am trying to make the men
come; there are too many who keep away.
I know very well that the regiment has a
good many Presbyterians, but if you could
see the Irish regiments—not a man misses
going to Mass.  Ah, messiou, the Catholic
padres have more influence than we have.
I ask myself, why?  I go every day to the
trenches, and even if the men think me an
old fool they might at least recognize that
I am a sportsman."</p>
<p>"The regiment is very fond of you, padre.
But, if you don't mind my saying so, I
think that Catholic priests have a special
influence.  Confession has something to do
with it, but their vow of celibacy more,
because, in a sort of way, it makes them
different from other people.  Even the
doctor tones down his best stories when
Father Murphy dines with us."</p>
<p>"But, my boy, I love O'Grady's stories;
I am an old soldier and a man of the world.
When I was shooting in Africa a negro
queen made me a present of three young
negresses."</p>
<p>"Padre!"</p>
<p>"Oh, I let them go the same day, which
annoyed them somewhat.  But I don't see
why, after that, I need play Mrs. Grundy
in the Mess."</p>
<p>One of the orderlies brought some boiling
water, and the padre asked Aurelle to make
the tea.</p>
<p>"When I was married—<emphasis>not</emphasis> that way,
messiou; it's curious that no Frenchman
can make tea.  Always warm the teapot
first, my boy; you cannot make good tea
with a cold teapot."</p>
<p>"You were talking about your wedding,
padre."</p>
<p>"Yes, I wanted to tell you how indignant
all these Pharisees were, who want me to
behave like a prude with young people,
when I merely wanted to be reasonable.
When I was going to be married, I naturally
had to ask one of my colleagues to perform
the ceremony.  After having settled the
important points, I said to him, 'In the
Marriage Service of the Church of England
there is one passage which I consider
absolutely indecent.  Yes, yes, I know quite
well that it is what St. Paul said.  Well,
probably in his time he had a perfect right
to say such things, and they were adapted
to the manners and customs of the
Corinthians, but they are not meant for the
ears of a young girl from Aberdeen in 1906.
My fiancée is innocent, and I will not have
her shocked.'  The young man, a worldly-minded
little curate, went and complained
to the bishop, who sent for me and said
haughtily, 'So it is <emphasis>you</emphasis> who are taking
upon yourself to forbid the reading of the
Epistle to the Corinthians?  I would have
you know that I am not the man to put up
with nonsense of this sort.'  'All right,' I
replied, 'I would have you know that I am
not the man to put up with an insult to my
wife.  If this fellow insists on reading the
passage I shall say nothing in the church,
out of respect for the sacred edifice, but I
promise you that after the ceremony I shall
box his ears.'</p>
<p>"Well, messiou, the bishop looked at me
carefully to see if I was in earnest.  Then
he remembered my campaign in the Transvaal,
the negro Queen, and the dangers of
a scandal, and he answered me with unction,
'I do not see after all that the passage that
shocks you is absolutely essential to the
marriage ceremony.'"</p>
<p>Dr. O'Grady here came in and asked for
a cup of tea.</p>
<p>"Who made this tea?" he demanded.
"You, Aurelle?  How much tea did you
put in?"</p>
<p>"One spoonful for each cup."</p>
<p>"Now listen to an axiom—one spoonful
for each cup and then one for the pot.  It
is curious that no Frenchman knows how
to make tea."</p>
<p>Aurelle changed the subject.</p>
<p>"The padre was telling me about his
wedding."</p>
<p>"A padre ought not to be married," said
the doctor.  "You know what St. Paul
said, 'A married man seeks to please his
wife and not God.'"</p>
<p>"You have put your foot in it now," said
Aurelle.  "Don't talk to him about St. Paul;
he has just been strafing him badly."</p>
<p>"Excuse me," said the padre, "I only
strafed a bishop."</p>
<p>"Padre," said the doctor, "judge not——"</p>
<p>"Oh, I know," said the padre, "the
Master said that, but He did not know any
bishops."  Then he returned to his old
subject.  "Tell me, O'Grady, you are Irish;
why have the Catholic chaplains more
influence than we?"</p>
<p>"Padre," said the doctor, "listen to a
parable.  It is your turn.  A man had
committed a murder.  He was not suspected,
but remorse made him restless and miserable.
One day, as he was passing an Anglican
church, it seemed to him that the secret
would be easier to bear if he could share
it with someone else, so he entered and
asked the vicar to hear his confession.</p>
<p>"The vicar was a very well brought up
young man, and had been at Eton and
Oxford.  Enchanted with this rare piece
of luck, he said eagerly, 'Most certainly,
open your heart to me; you can talk to
me as if I were your father!'  The other
began: 'I have killed a man.'  The vicar
sprang to his feet.  'And you come here
to tell me that?  Horrible murderer!  I
am not sure that it is not my duty, as a
citizen to take you to the nearest police
station.  In any case it is my duty as a
gentleman not to keep you a moment longer
under my roof.'</p>
<p>"And the man went away.  A few miles
farther on he saw a Roman Catholic
church.  A last hope made him enter, and
he knelt down behind some old women who
were waiting by the confessional.  When
his turn came he could just distinguish the
priest praying in the shadows, his head in
his hands.  'Father,' he said, 'I am not a
Catholic, but I should like to confess to
you.'  'I am listening, my son.'  'Father,
I have committed murder.'</p>
<p>"He awaited the effect of this terrible
revelation.  In the austere silence of the
church the voice of the priest said simply,
'How many times, my son?'"</p>
<p>"Doctor," said the padre, "you know
that I am Scotch.  I can only take in a
story eight days after I hear it."</p>
<p>"That one will take you longer, padre,"
said the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER X</strong></p>
<p>S. W. Tarkington, an officer of
fifty-three, honorary lieutenant and
quartermaster, was possessed of a
vain but keen desire to win one more
ribbon before retiring.  The laws of nature
and eighteen years of good conduct had
given him the South African medal and
the long service ribbon.  But with a little
luck even an honorary lieutenant may pick
up a Military Cross if the bullets fall in
the right place.  That is why Tarkington
was always to be found in dangerous corners
where he had no business, and that is why,
on the day Loos was taken, he wandered
with his rheumatic old joints over the
soaking battlefield and carried in eighteen
wounded men on his back.  But he met
no general and no one knew anything about
it, except the wounded, who have no
influence.</p>
<p>From there the regiment was sent to the
north and went into the line in the Ypres
salient.  There existed, no doubt, excellent
sentimental and military reasons for defending
this piece of ground, but as a winter
residence it left much to be desired.
Tarkington did not fear the danger—shells
were part of the day's work—but his
rheumatism feared the water, and the rain
falling incessantly on the greasy clay made
a damp and icy paste which no doctor
would recommend for the oiling of old
joints.  Tarkington, whose painfully swollen
feet now made the shortest march a Chinese
torture, finally realized that he must apply
to be sent to hospital.</p>
<p>"It's just my luck," he said to his
confidant, the sergeant-major.  "I have the
pain without the wound."</p>
<p>So he went off limping and swearing to
find the colonel in his dug-out, and told him
of the state of his legs.</p>
<p>The colonel was in a bad temper that
morning.  A communication from the headquarters
of the division had pointed out to
him that the proportion of trench feet in his
regiment had reached 3.6 per cent., whereas
the average of the corps was only 2.7.  And
would he take the necessary precautions to
reduce his percentage in the future?</p>
<p>The necessary precautions had been taken;
he had sent for the doctor and given him
the communication.</p>
<p>"And see here, O'Grady.  You may have
bronchitis, sore throats and gastric enteritis,
but I do not want any more trench feet for
three days."</p>
<p>You may imagine how Tarkington was
received when he came to exhibit his
paralysed feet.</p>
<p>"Now that's the limit.  <emphasis>I</emphasis> send down an
officer for trench feet?  Read, Tarkington,
read, and do you imagine I am going to
transform 3.5 into 3.6 to please <emphasis>you</emphasis>?  Look
up, my friend, General Routine Orders
No. 324—'Trench Feet result from a
contraction of the superficial arteries with the
consequence that the skin no longer being
nourished dies and mortifies.'  Therefore,
all you have to do is to watch your arteries.
Tarkington, I am extremely sorry, old man,
but that is all I can do for you."</p>
<p>"Just my luck," said the old man to his
friend the sergeant-major.  "I have thirty-seven
years' service; I have never been ill;
and when, for the first time in my life, I ask
for sick leave, it happens on the very same
day that headquarters have strafed the
colonel over that very subject."</p>
<p>His feet became red, then blue, and had
begun to turn black when the colonel went
away on leave.  The command in his
absence was taken over by Major Parker,
who, being the second son of a peer, paid
small attention to remarks from the brigade.
He saw the distress of the unfortunate
Tarkington, and sent him to the field
hospital, where they decided to send him
to England.  It seemed that Tarkington
was not the kind to be acclimatized in the
Flemish marshes.</p>
<p>He was taken to B—— and put on board
the hospital ship <emphasis>Saxonia</emphasis>, with the wounded,
doctors and nurses.  The port officials had
ascertained to their annoyance the day
before that a number of floating mines were
in the Channel.</p>
<p>The authorities argued over the origin
of these mines, which the N.T.O. said
were those of the Allies, while the
M.L.O. thought they were the enemy's.  But there
was no argument about one detail: every
boat that had come into contact with one
had been cut in two and sunk immediately.</p>
<p>The captain of the <emphasis>Saxonia</emphasis> was convinced
that the Channel was free from mines.  He
risked it—and was blown up.</p>
<p>So Tarkington jumped into the sea.  As
a good soldier, his instinct was to devote his
last minutes to keeping calm, and he swam
about quietly with the gas mask that he had
been advised never to lose hanging round
his neck.</p>
<p>A salvage boat picked him up, unconscious,
and he was taken to a hospital
on the English coast.  He recovered
consciousness, but felt very ill from his
immersion in the water.</p>
<p>"Just like my cursed luck!" he groaned.
"They stop me starting for a month, and
when at last I do get off, it is in the only
ship that has gone down for a year."</p>
<p>"They are all alike," said the colonel, on
his return from leave.  "Here's a blighter
who grumbles at having his feet in water,
and then takes advantage of my absence to
go and have a salt-water bath!"</p>
<p>Now, a few months before, King George,
after his accident in France, had crossed the
Channel on board the <emphasis>Saxonia</emphasis>.  The fate of
the ship naturally interested His Majesty,
who came to see the survivors, and, as
Tarkington was the only officer, he had the
inestimable privilege of quite a long
conversation with the King.  The result of this
was that a few days afterwards a regiment
"somewhere in France" received a
memorandum from general headquarters asking
for a statement of the services of
Tarkington, S. W.</p>
<p>The memorandum being accompanied by
certain verbal comments on the subject of
"a very distinguished personage" by an
officer in a red-banded gold-peaked cap, the
colonel wrote nice things—which he had
never said to him—of Tarkington, S. W.,
and the sergeant-major gave details of the
brilliant conduct of the quartermaster at
Loos.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>London Gazette</emphasis> a fortnight later
recapitulated these exploits in a supplement
to the list of awards and honours, and
Tarkington, honorary captain, M.C., meditating
on his fate, found the world not such a bad
place after all.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XI</strong></p>
<p>The first encounter that the brigade
had with the village was not
happy.</p>
<p>The village looked distrustfully on the
brigade, with its bare knees and its language
like the rolling of a drum.  The brigade
found the village short of <emphasis>estaminets</emphasis> and
pretty girls.  The people of Hondezeele
bewailed the departure of a division of
London Territorials, with their soft voices
and full pockets, and wherever Aurelle
went they did nothing but sing the praises
of these sons of their adoption.</p>
<p>"Your Scotchmen, we know them.  We
cannot understand what they say—and my
little girls can speak English."</p>
<p>"Scotch—Promenade—no bon!" said the
little girls.</p>
<p>"I had the general's chauffeur here," went
on the old woman, "a nice boy, sir.  Billy,
they called him.  He washed up for me,
and pleasant spoken, too, and good manners.
An officers' Mess?  Certainly not.  I can
make more selling fried potatoes and beer
to the boys, and even eggs, although they
cost me threepence each."</p>
<p>"Fried potatoes, two painnies a plate,
aigs and bacon, one franc," chorused the
little girls.</p>
<p>Aurelle went on to the next house,
where other old women mourned other
Billys, Harrys, Gingers, and Darkies.</p>
<p>One stout lady explained that noise gave
her palpitations; another, quite seventy-five,
that it was not proper for a girl living alone.</p>
<p>At last he found a corpulent lady whom
he overwhelmed with such eloquent
protestations that she could not get in a word.
The next morning, he sent her the orderlies
with the plate and crockery, and at
lunchtime brought along Parker and O'Grady.
The servants were waiting for them at the
door.</p>
<p>"Madame is a regular witch, sir.  She's
a proper fury, that's what she is, sir."</p>
<p>"Madame" welcomed them with confused complaints.</p>
<p>"Ah! bien merci!  Ah! bien merci!
How I have regretted having agreed to have
you.  I have not had a wink of sleep with
my husband abusing me.  He nearly beat
me, monsieur.  Oh, don't touch that!  I
forbid you to enter my clean kitchen.  Wipe
your feet, and take those boxes off there!"</p>
<p>"Put the boxes in the dining-room,"
ordered Aurelle, to conciliate her.</p>
<p>"Thank you!  Put your dirty boxes
in my dining-room, with my beautiful table
and my fine dresser!  I should think so,
indeed!"</p>
<p>"But, in heaven's name, madame," said
Aurelle, quietly, "where shall I put them?"</p>
<p>He half opened a door at the end of the
dining-room.</p>
<p>"Will you kindly leave that door alone!
My lovely <emphasis>salon</emphasis>, where I do not even go
myself for fear of making it dirty!  And,
besides, I have had enough of your Mess, I'm
about tired of it."</p>
<p>A little later, Aurelle went into Madame
Lemaire's, the draper's, to buy some
chocolate.  She had relegated all her pre-war
trade to a corner of the shop, and now sold,
like the rest of the village, Quaker Oats,
Woodbine cigarettes, and post-cards with
the words: "From your Soldier Boy."</p>
<p>While she was serving him, Aurelle
espied behind the shop a charming, bright
little apartment, decorated with plates on
the wall, and a clean cloth, with green and
white squares, on the table.  He strolled
carelessly towards the door.  Madame Lemaire
looked suspiciously at him and folded her
arms across her enormous bust.</p>
<p>"Would you believe, madame, that there
are in this village people so unpatriotic as
to refuse to take in officers, who do not know
where to eat their meals?"</p>
<p>"Is it possible?" said Madame Lemaire,
blushing.</p>
<p>He told her who they were.</p>
<p>"Ah, the carpenter's wife!" said Madame
Lemaire, turning up her nose in disgust.
"I am not surprised.  They come from
Moevekerke, and the people of Moevekerke
are all bad."</p>
<p>"But it seems to me," insinuated Aurelle
gently, "that you have a room here that
would just do."</p>

<p>*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p>A week later the village and the brigade
were tasting the pure joys of the honeymoon.
In each house a Jack, a Ginger or a
Darkey helped to wash up, called the old
lady Granny, and joked with the girls.  The
London Territorials were quite forgotten.
At night, in the barns, beribboned
bagpipes accompanied the monotonous dances.</p>
<p>Aurelle had lodged the padre at Madame
Potiphar's, a lively young widow to whom
the divisions, billeted in turn in the village,
had handed on this nickname, like a local
password.</p>
<p>The virtue of the padre, which had protected
him against the solid charms of three
young negresses, feared nothing from the
manoeuvres of a village Potiphar.</p>
<p>Parker and O'Grady shared a large room
in the inn.  They called the publican and
his wife Papa and Mamma.  Lucie and
Berthe, the daughters of the house, taught
them French.  Lucie was six feet high;
she was pretty, slender, and fair.  Berthe
was more substantial and remarkably
good-natured.  These two fine Flemish girls,
honest without prudishness, greedy of gain,
lacking in culture but not in shrewdness,
were the admiration of Major Parker.</p>
<p>Although their father was in a fair way
to making a fortune by selling the Tommies
English beer made in France, they never
thought of asking him for money for their
clothes or of making a servant work in their
stead.</p>
<p>"One ought to be able to fight when one
leaves such women at home," said the major
admiringly.</p>
<p>The father was the same sort.  He described
to Aurelle the death of his son, a
splendid boy, three times mentioned in
despatches.  He talked of him with a pride
and resignation truly admirable.</p>
<p>Aurelle advised the publican, if he had
a few hundred francs to spare, to put them
in the War Loan.</p>
<p>"I have already put in fifty thousand
francs," said the old man.  "I shall wait a
little now."</p>
<p>The whole village was rich.</p>
<p>Colonel Bramble gave two sous one day
to Madame Lemaire's son, an urchin of five or six.</p>
<p>"To buy some sweets with," Aurelle told him.</p>
<p>"Oh no, I don't care for them."</p>
<p>"What will you do with your sous, then?"</p>
<p>"Put them in my money-box till I have
got enough to get a deposit book in the
Savings Bank; then, when I am grown up,
I shall buy some land."</p>
<p>That evening Aurelle repeated this to
Lucie and Berthe, thinking it would amuse
them.  He soon found out that no one was
amused: jokes about money were sacrilege.
The publican related a little moral story to
make this clear.</p>
<p>"When I was small," he said, "I often
used to go on messages into the town for
Monsieur le curé, and each time he gave me
two sous, which I took to my father.  But
after a time, Monsieur le curé made old
Sophie, his servant, send me on his
commissions and she never gave me my two
sous.  My father, who asked me for them,
was very indignant.  He consulted my
grandfather, and the whole family were
called in one evening to discuss the
matter.</p>
<p>"My father said, 'The child cannot go
and complain to Monsieur le curé, because
if it is he who has stopped the two sous
he might be offended.'  'And if it is old
Sophie who has diddled the child out of it
she would box his ears,' said my mother.
My grandfather, who was no fool, hit upon
the best way.  He said to me, 'You will
go and make your confession to Monsieur
le curé.  You will tell him that you have
sinned by getting angry with old Sophie
because she sent you to the town without
giving you anything.'</p>
<p>"It was a great success.  'What,' said
the curé.  'The old wretch!  She charged
me for them every time.  Release me from
the secret of the confessional and I will
give her a good talking-to!'  I remembered
that her hand was heavy and I did
not release him; but in future he always
sent me himself."</p>
<p>The schoolmistress from Lille, who
possessed the only piano in the village,
explained to Aurelle that she had had to cut
out of her lesson the whole chapter on
economy and thrift, substituting a lesson on
generosity.  A little girl of eight then said
to her, "I can never do that, mademoiselle.
My mother is mean, and I am sure I shall
be meaner than she."</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Highlanders were turning
the King's shillings into glasses of beer, and
were showering on these economical little
girls embroidered aprons, sugar-plums and
post-cards, with "From Your Soldier Boy"
on them, price ninepence.</p>
<p>The plump and active mothers of these
nice little Flemish girls sold the aprons and
post-cards.</p>
<p>"Ah, messiou," said Colonel Bramble,
"before the War we used to talk about
frivolous France; now it is stern and
prudent France."</p>
<p>"Yes," added the doctor, "the French
are hard and severe on themselves.  I begin
to understand the Boche who said, 'Man
does not aspire to happiness, only
Englishmen.'  There is, among your peasants of the
north, an admirable voluntary asceticism."</p>
<p>"Did you ever see, messiou," said the
padre, "in our country, before the War,
the Frenchman of the music-hall?  The
little fellow with the black beard, who
gesticulates and harangues?  I believed it,
messiou, and never pictured these devout
and industrious villagers."</p>
<p>"I like to see them on Sunday morning,"
said the major, "when the bell for Mass
starts ringing, and they all come out of
their houses together, old men, women and
children, as if they were going to a theatre.
Ah, messiou, why didn't you tell us all
about this before the War?"</p>
<p>"The reason is," said Aurelle, "that we
didn't know it ourselves."</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XII</strong></p>
<p>Orion's belt rose higher in the
wintry sky; the roads were frozen
hard.  The mail vans overflowed
more and more every day with enormous
quantities of puddings and Christmas cards,
and the festive season recalled the joys of
life to the division and the village.</p>
<p>The preparations for the Christmas dinner
occupied Aurelle and the padre for some
time.  The latter found a turkey worthy of
the royal table at a farm; Aurelle hunted
from house to house for chestnuts; Parker
attended himself to the cooking, and mixed
a salad of which he was very proud, but the
colonel examined it long and doubtfully.
As for the doctor, he was sent off with
Aurelle to Bailleul to buy some champagne,
and insisted on sampling several different
brands, which inspired him to give vent to
some strange doctrines on things in general
on the way home.</p>
<p>He obtained permission to invite his
friends Berthe and Lucie to come in at the
end of dinner to drink a bumper of
champagne in the Mess, and when they entered
in their Sunday dresses, the colonel played
"Destiny Waltz," speed 61.  The orderlies
had hung a great bunch of mistletoe over
the door, and the girls asked ingenuously
if it was not the custom in England to kiss
under the mistletoe.</p>
<p>"Oh, certainly," said the doctor, and with
his hands behind his back, he pecked Berthe
on the cheek which she turned towards him.
Parker, equally nervous, did the same to
pretty Lucie, and Aurelle gave them both
a good hug in the French way.</p>
<p>"That's fine, mademoiselle?" said the
little doctor.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Lucie with a sigh.  "We
wish it was always Christmas."</p>
<p>"Oh, but why?" said the doctor.</p>
<p>"Think how dull it will be for us after
the War," replied Berthe, "when you are
all gone!  Before, one did not think of
it—one saw no one—one worked, one knew no
better, but now, without the boys, the village
will be empty indeed.  My sister and I will
not stay here.  We will go to Paris or
London."</p>
<p>"Oh, but that's a pity," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"No, no," said Aurelle, "you will just
get married.  You will marry rich farmers,
you will be very busy with your beasts and
your chickens and you will forget all
about us."</p>
<p>"It's easy to say 'get married,'" observed
Berthe, "but it takes two for that.  And if
there are not enough young men for all the
girls we shall probably get left in the lurch."</p>
<p>"Every man will have several wives,"
said Aurelle.  "You will be much happier;
with one husband between you two; you
will only have half the housework to do."</p>
<p>"I do not think I should like it," said
Lucie, who was very refined.</p>
<p>But the padre, to whom the doctor had
just treacherously translated Aurelle's
cynical proposals, indignantly protested.</p>
<p>"<emphasis>You</emphasis> ought not to criticize polygamy,
padre," said the doctor.  "Re-read your
Bible.  What have you to say about old
Laban, who, having sold his two daughters
to the same man, payable monthly for
fourteen years, gave the purchaser in
addition two waiting-maids as a bonus."</p>
<p>"But," said the padre, "I am not
responsible for the actions of a doubtful
patriarch.  I have no sympathy with
Laban."</p>
<p>"No more have I," said Aurelle.  "This
Dufayel of marriage has always profoundly
disgusted me, but more on account of his
matrimonial methods than for having gone
in for the polygamy natural to his tribe.
Moreover, is the number of women to be
apportioned to one man a question of
morals?  It appears to me to be a question
of arithmetic.  If there are nearly as many
women as men, monogamy is the rule; if
for some reason the number of women is
increased, polygamy is perhaps better for
the general welfare."</p>
<p>The two girls, who understood this
conversation much less than the "promenade"
and the "na poo" of the Tommies, went up
to the colonel, who talked to them paternally
in his gruff way and got the "Caruso"
record for them out of its pink cover.</p>
<p>"You have some weird ideas about
animal psychology, Aurelle," said the doctor.
"If you have observed nature, you would
have proved, on the contrary, that the
question of the numbers of mates is
certainly not a question of arithmetic.  With
gnats, ten females are born to one male.
Now gnats are not polygamous.  Nine of
those females die spinsters.  It is only the
old maids who bite us, from which one sees
that celibacy engenders ferocity among
insects as well as among women."</p>
<p>"I have known some charming old maids,"
said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"Indeed!" said the doctor.  "But,
however that may be, the number of married
pairs varies simply according to the way the
species feed.  Rabbits, Turks, sheep, artists,
and, generally speaking, all herbivorous
creatures are polygamous; while foxes,
Englishmen, wolves, bankers, and, generally
speaking, all carnivorous animals are
monogamists.  That is because of the difficulty
which carnivorous animals find in rearing
their young until they are strong enough to
kill for themselves.  As for polyandry, it
occurs in wretched countries like Thibet,
where several men must unite forces to keep
one wife and her progeny."</p>
<p>The howls of Caruso rendered all
conversation impossible for a minute, then
Aurelle said to Lucie:</p>
<p>"The other girls in the village will
perhaps find it difficult to get husbands, it
is true, but you and your sister need not
worry; you are the prettiest, and you will
soon have the richest father.  You will
have fine marriage portions."</p>
<p>"Yes, that's true.  Perhaps they will
marry us for our money," said Berthe, who
was modest.</p>
<p>"I should not care to be married for my
money," said Lucie.</p>
<p>"Oh, strange creature!" said the doctor,
"you would like to be loved for your face
alone, that is to say, for the position in
space of the albuminoids and fatty molecules
placed there by the working of some
Mendelian heredity, but you would dislike
to be loved for your fortune, to which you
have contributed by your labour and your
domestic virtues."</p>
<p>Berthe regarded the doctor nervously and
reminded her sister that they had some
glasses to wash before going to bed: so
they emptied their bumpers and departed.</p>
<p>After a restful silence, Major Parker
asked Aurelle to explain the institution
of the marriage <emphasis>dot</emphasis>, and, when he had
grasped it, indignantly replied:</p>
<p>"What?  A man receives this splendid
gift, a pretty woman, and he exacts money
before accepting her?  But what you tell
me is monstrous, Aurelle, and dangerous.
Instead of marrying beautiful and good
women who would have beautiful and good
children, you marry ugly, quarrelsome
creatures provided with a cheque-book."</p>
<p>"'He who has found a good wife has
found great happiness,'" quoted the padre,
"'but a quarrelsome woman is like a roof
that lets in the rain.'"</p>
<p>"It is wrong to suppose the children of
love-matches better made than others,"
interrupted the doctor, becoming rather
warlike, obviously owing to champagne.
"Oh, I know the old theory: every man
chooses his natural complement, and thus
rears children which revert to the average
type of the race.  Big men like little women,
large noses like little snub-noses, and very
feminine men fall in love with Amazons.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, a nervous, short-sighted,
intellectual man marries a pedantic,
nervous, short-sighted woman because their
tastes are similar.  Good riders make
acquaintance with girls who hunt, and marry
them for their sporting tastes.</p>
<p>"So, far from reverting to the average
type, love-matches tend to exaggerate the
differences.  And then is it desirable for
selection to operate?  There are very few
really brilliant men who have not had at
least one madman among their ancestors.
The modern world has been founded by
three epileptics—Alexander, Julius Cæsar
and Luther, without mentioning Napoleon,
who was not altogether well balanced.</p>
<p>"In a thousand men of genius, how many
mad relations?" asked the colonel.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you, sir," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"You can talk nonsense to your heart's
content, doctor," said Major Parker.  "But
as far as I am concerned, if I ever marry,
I shall only marry a very pretty woman.
What's the name of that charming cinema
actress we saw together at Hazebrouck, Aurelle?</p>
<p>"Napierkowska, sir."</p>
<p>"Oh yes.  Well, if I knew her I would
marry her at once.  And I am sure that
she is if anything better and more intelligent
than the average woman."</p>
<p>"My friend Shaw," said the doctor, "says
that to desire to be perpetually in the
society of a pretty woman, until the end
of one's days, is as if, because one likes good
wine, one wished always to have one's
mouth full of it."</p>
<p>"Rather a flimsy argument," observed
the major.  "For surely that is better than
having it always full of bad wine."</p>
<p>"Anyhow," the doctor replied, "women
who exhibit more surely than us the
underlying instincts of mankind are far
from bearing out your theory; I know
very few who make a point of marrying
a good-looking man."</p>
<p>"Well, do you know the story about
Frazer?" said the major.</p>
<p>"Which Frazer?" said the colonel.
"G.R. of the 60th?"</p>
<p>"No, no.  A.K. of the 5th Gurkhas—the
one who played polo for the regiment
in 1900, an awfully good-looking fellow,
the finest chin in the army."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know him," said the colonel, "the
son of old Sir Thomas.  His father sold
me a damned good pony, when I was a
subaltern, and I only paid 200 rupees
for it.  Well, what is his story?"</p>
<p>"At the beginning of 1915," said the
major, "Frazer, who was crossing London
on his way home on leave, went to the
theatre one evening alone.  Towards the
end of the first act, he felt vaguely that
some one was staring at him.  He looked
up and saw a woman in a box looking
at him.  But, owing to the darkness of
the theatre, he could not distinguish her
features.</p>
<p>"In the interval, he tried to see her, but
she had withdrawn to the back of her box.
During the next two acts she looked at
him fixedly.  Frazer, decidedly intrigued,
was waiting at the exit of the theatre, when
a magnificent footman approached him,
saying, 'A lady wishes to speak to you, sir,'
and led him to the door of a carriage
which had stopped in a side street.</p>
<p>"'You do not know me, Captain Frazer,'
said a very pretty voice, 'but I know
you; have you anything to do this
evening or will you come to supper with
me?'  Frazer did what we should all have done."</p>
<p>"He ran away?" said the padre.</p>
<p>"He got into the carriage," said Parker.
"He was asked to allow himself to be blindfolded.
When the bandage was taken off
he found himself in a charming room, alone
with the fair unknown, who was <emphasis>decolletèe</emphasis>
and wearing a mask, and who had the most
beautiful shoulders in the world?"</p>
<p>"Is this by Dumas <emphasis>père</emphasis> or R. L. Stevenson?"
asked Aurelle.</p>
<p>"It is a story of what actually happened
in January, 1915, and was told me by a man
who never lies," said Major Parker.  "The
house was in silence.  No servant appeared,
but Frazer, delighted, was offered by the
unknown herself what you French call, I
believe, <emphasis>bon souper, bon gîte et le reste</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"At break of day, she bandaged his eyes
again.  He told her how much he had
enjoyed himself and asked her when he
could see her again.  'Never,' she replied,
'and I take it that I have your word of
honour as a gentleman and a soldier that
you will never try to find me again.  But
in one year from now, to the day, go back
to the same theatre where we met, and
there will, perhaps, be a letter for you.'
Then she saw him into the carriage again,
and asked him to keep his eyes blindfolded
for ten minutes: when he took off the
bandage, he was in Trafalgar Square.</p>
<p>"Frazer naturally moved heaven and
earth to get leave in January, 1916, and on
the evening of the anniversary of his
adventure appeared at the box office of
the theatre and asked for a stall.  'Have
you by any chance a letter for me?' he
said, giving his name.  The clerk handed
him an envelope, and Frazer, eagerly opening
it, read this short line: 'It is a fine
boy.  Thank you.'"</p>
<p>"What is still more strange," said the
doctor with sarcasm, "is that another
good-looking lad told me the same story some
time before the war, and that that time he
was the hero of it."</p>
<p>"Then this lady must have several
children," said the colonel.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XIII</strong></p>
<p>EXTRACTS FROM AURELLE's DIARY</p>
<p>Hondezeele, January 19—.</p>
<p>Madame Lemaire has presented
the Mess with a bottle
of old brandy, and the doctor
is in very good form this evening.  He is
the true Irish type; a lover of surprising
epigrams.</p>
<p>He says, "We owe to the Middle Ages
the two worst inventions of humanity—romantic
love and gunpowder."  Again,
"The whole reason of this War is because
the Germans have no sense of humour."</p>
<p>But, above all, you must hear his scientific
and precise demonstration of his favourite
theory: "Two telegrams contrary in sense,
and from officers equal in rank, cancel one
another."</p>
<p>January 4th.</p>
<p>Rode with the colonel and Parker.  How
delicate and clear the atmosphere is in this
northern part of France!  The colonel was
highly indignant to hear that I have never
been out hunting.</p>
<p>"You <emphasis>must</emphasis>, messiou, it is the only sport.
You jump banks as high as your horse.
At eighteen I had nearly broken my neck
twice.  It is most exciting."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Parker, "one day I was
galloping in a wood and a branch went into
my right eye.  It is a miracle I wasn't
killed.  Another time——"</p>
<p>He described how his horse fell on the
top of him and broke two of his ribs.  Then
both of them together, certain of having
convinced me:</p>
<p>"You must hunt after the War, messiou."</p>
<p>January 7th.</p>
<p>This morning, I do not know why, some
French troops came through Hondezeele.
The village and I were delighted.  We like
the shrill bagpipes, but no music in the
world is like "Sidi-Brahim" and "Sambre-et-Meuse."</p>
<p>I was pleased, too, to be able to show
Parker these Chasseurs à pied, as all he had
seen of our army were old Territorials.  He
was much impressed.</p>
<p>"They are as fine as the Highlanders,"
he told me.</p>
<p>And then he described the Lennox as
they were when he joined as second
lieutenant in Egypt.</p>
<p>"I was forbidden to speak at Mess for
six months.  An excellent practice!  It
taught us to realize how humble we were,
and the respect due to our elders.</p>
<p>"If some 'swelled head' did not conform
to these rules, he soon found his things all
packed up in his room, labelled for England.
If he still refused to understand, he was
called up before a subaltern's court-martial,
and heard some home truths about
himself.</p>
<p>"It was hard, but what <emphasis>esprit de corps</emphasis> and
what discipline those rough ways taught us.
We shall never see a regiment again like
the Lennox of 1914.  The officer of to-day
has seen active service, it's true, but as a
matter of fact it is quite sufficient in war
to have good health and no more imagination
than a fish.  It is in peace-time that
one ought to judge a soldier."</p>
<p>"You remind me," said the doctor, "of
the sergeant-major in the Guards who said:
'How I wish the war would finish so that
we could have real manoeuvres once
more!'"</p>
<p>This evening, while the gramophone was
raging, I forced myself to translate into
French Rudyard Kipling's admirable poem,
"If."</p>
<p>I showed it in English to Parker whom
it describes so well, and we talked about
books.  I made the mistake of mentioning
Dickens.</p>
<p>"I detest Dickens," said the major.  "I
never could understand how anyone could
find him interesting.  His books are all
stories of the lower classes and Bohemians.
I do not want to know how they live.  In
the whole of Dickens' works there is not
one gentleman.  No, if you wish to know
the <emphasis>chef-d'oeuvre</emphasis> of English novels read
'Jorrocks.'"</p>
<p>January 13th.</p>
<p>A little English telephonist who came to
mend our apparatus said to me, "Telephones
are like women, sir.  No one really
knows anything about them.  One fine day,
something goes wrong; you try to find out
why, no good, you swear, you shake them
up a bit and all is well."</p>
<p>January 14th.</p>
<p>At dinner an Irish colonel remarked:
"I am very annoyed; during my last
leave I rented a house for my family, and
now my wife writes that it is haunted.
The owners really ought to tell one these things."</p>
<p>"Perhaps they did not know it," said our
indulgent colonel.</p>
<p>"They knew it very well.  When my
wife went to complain, they got very
confused, and ended by owning up.  One
of their great-grandmothers has walked
from the drawing-room to her old bedroom
for the last hundred and fifty years.
They tried to excuse themselves by saying
she was perfectly harmless.  That is possible
and I am quite willing to believe it, but it
is none the less annoying for my wife.  Do
you think I can cancel my lease?"</p>
<p>I here risked a sceptical remark, but the
whole Mess jumped on me.  Irish ghosts
are scientific facts.</p>
<p>"But why do phantoms love Irish houses
more than others?"</p>
<p>"Because," said the Irish colonel, "we
are a very sensitive race and we enter into
communication with them more easily."</p>
<p>And he crushed me with technical
arguments on wireless telegraphy.</p>
<p>January 15th.</p>
<p>The colonel, having found out this
morning that a motor-ambulance was going
into Ypres, took me with him.  In front
of the hospital we found ourselves wedged
in by a terrible block of waggons, under
a fierce bombardment.</p>
<p>A horse with its carotid artery cut by
a bit of shell, and only held up by the
shafts, was writhing in agony close by us.
The drivers were swearing.  Nothing to do
but wait patiently in our car, shaken by
explosions.</p>
<p>"Dr. Johnson was right," said the colonel
to me, "Whoever wants to be a hero ought
to drink brandy."</p>
<p>Then, as a fresh explosion made the
debris of the ruined town in front of us
tremble, he said:</p>
<p>"Messiou, how many inhabitants were
there in Ypres before the War?"</p>
<p>January 20th.</p>
<p>We are going to leave Hondezeele.  The
red-hats are getting agitated and already
one sees the cyclists passing, the natural
advance-guard of our migrations.</p>
<p>We were beginning to love this country:
the village and the brigade, so distrustful
of one another a month ago, had become
really quite affectionate.  But the gods
are jealous.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>... Demain, départ de la brigade:</p>
<p>La cornemuse et le tambour</p>
<p>Douneront la dernière aubade</p>
<p>A ces fugitives amours.</p>
<p>Les montagnards aux beaux genoux,</p>
<p>Qui mimaient la danse du sable</p>
<p>Avec des chants graves et doux</p>
<p>Vont danser la ronde du Diable.</p>
<p>La Victoire, un jour, les cherchant,</p>
<p>Les trouvera trois pieds sous terre,</p>
<p>Mais par ces fermes et ces champs</p>
<p>Flottera leur ombre légère.</p>
<p>Et dans nos villages des Flandres...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interrupted by the arrival of our
successors, the Canadians, regarded by Madame
Lemaire and her little boy with great
suspicion.  <emphasis>That</emphasis> won't last long.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XIV</strong></p>
<p>A great attack was in preparation;
it was a terrible secret jealously
guarded by headquarters; but
Aurelle was informed of it several days
beforehand by the German <emphasis>communiqué</emphasis>
published in the <emphasis>Times</emphasis>, and by Madame
Lemaire's little boy, who advised him not
to repeat it.</p>
<p>However, the division was soon ordered
to occupy one of the sectors in the attack.
The padre, optimistic as ever, already
foresaw triumphant marches, but the colonel
gently reminded him that the objectives
were simply a ridge, which in peace-time
would be called "a slight undulation in the
ground," and two villages already destroyed.
The real object was to engage the forces
of the enemy, who were at that moment
advancing in Russia.  But this information
only redoubled the enthusiasm of the padre.</p>
<p>"You can say what you like, sir; if we
hold this ridge they cannot hold out in the
valley, and we shall break through their
line.  As for the retreat of the Russians,
that's capital.  The Boche gets farther from
his base, lengthens his lines of communications,
and he's done."</p>
<p>"He is not," said the colonel, "but he
will be one day, and that's all that matters."</p>
<p>The evening of the offensive, Aurelle
received orders from the colonel to go
and act as liaison officer between the
headquarters of the division and some French
batteries, which were reinforcing the British
artillery in this sector.  He wished the
Lennox good luck and left them for a day.</p>
<p>He spent the night in the garden of the
little château where the general was living.
The bombardment thundered on without
ceasing.  Aurelle walked up and down the
paths of this garden, which had been pretty,
but was now honeycombed with trenches
and dug-outs, while camouflaged huts
covered the lawns.</p>
<p>Towards midnight, the rain, the classic
rain of an offensive, began to fall in large
drops.  The interpreter took shelter in a
shed with some chauffeurs and motorcyclists.
He always liked to find himself
among this class of Englishmen, with their
strong language and simple minds.  These,
like the rest, were good fellows, careless,
courageous and light-hearted.  They hummed
the latest music-hall airs from London,
showed him photographs of their wives,
sweethearts and babies, and asked him when
the damned war would be over.  They
shared on this subject the perfect optimism
of the padre.</p>
<p>One of them, a little, quick-witted
electrician, asked Aurelle to explain the
Alsatian question.  And so he told them about
Saverne, the march past of the Strasburg
students before Kléber's statue, the pilgrimages
of the Alsatians to Belfort for the 14th
of July Review, and about the young men
who at the age of twenty left family and
fortune to go to France and become
soldiers.</p>
<p>They told him that they could understand
anyone loving France: it was a fine
country.  All the same there were not
enough hedges in the landscape.  But they
appreciated the thrifty qualities of the
women, the trees along the road, and the
out-of-door cafés.  They talked with
enthusiasm about Verdun, but many of them had
only grasped the idea of the Entente through
Carpentier's victory in London.</p>
<p>The day dawned; the rain was now falling
in torrents; on the lawn, the grass and soil
was trodden into a sticky mass.  Aurelle
went up to the château; he met an
aide-de-camp whom he knew and explained his
orders.</p>
<p>"Oh yes," he was told.  "I arranged
that myself with the French liaison officer.
If the telephone from the batteries happens
to get cut, we shall have recourse to you.
Go into the signalling room and sit down.
In ten minutes from now," he added, "our
men go over the top."</p>
<p>The signalling room was the old winter
garden.  On the wall, a large-scale map of
the trenches showed the British lines in
black, and those of the enemy in red.  At
two long tables six telephone operators
were installed.  Silent officers with red tabs
paced calmly up and down the room, and
Aurelle thought of one of Major Parker's
favourite remarks: "A gentleman is never
in a hurry."</p>
<p>As five o'clock struck, the general came
in and the officers stood still and said all
together:</p>
<p>"Good morning, sir."</p>
<p>"Good morning," said the general politely.</p>
<p>He was very tall; his carefully brushed
grey hair, neatly parted, framed his fine
features.  Gold lace shone on the red facings
of his well-cut tunic.</p>
<p>Discovering Aurelle in his corner, he
very kindly gave him a little "Good
morning" all to himself, and then he
walked slowly, with his hands behind his
back, between the two long tables of the
telephonists.  The noise of the guns had
suddenly ceased, and nothing was heard
in the room but the authoritative and
measured step of the general.</p>
<p>A muffled bell tingled; an operator
quietly made a note of the message on
a pink form.</p>
<p>"5.5 a.m.," read the general softly,
"10th Brigade.  Attack begun, enemy
barrage not very effective, violent machine-gun fire."</p>
<p>Then he passed the telegram to an officer,
who stuck it on a long pin.</p>
<p>"Transmit it to the corps," said the general.</p>
<p>And the officer wrote on a white paper:
"5.10 a.m. 10th Brigade reports as follows:
Attack begun.  Enemy barrage not very
effective.  Violent machine-gun fire."</p>
<p>He filed a carbon copy on another pin,
and handed the original to an operator,
who, in his turn, read it into the machine.</p>
<p>Inflexibly and monotonously the white
and pink messages slowly accumulated.
One brigade was in the enemy's first line
trenches, the other had stopped before a
concreted nest of machine-guns.  The
general reinforced them with details from
the 3rd Brigade, then rang up the artillery
several times to tell them to destroy the
pill box.  And these orders were transcribed
on to the pink and white forms.  An officer,
standing before the huge map, carefully
manoeuvred small coloured flags, and all
this methodical agitation reminded Aurelle
of a large banking house on the Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>Towards six o'clock in the morning, a
Staff officer beckoned to him, and, leading
him up to the map, showed him the
emplacement of a French .155 and asked
him to go and see the officer, and tell him
to destroy at all costs a certain railway
cutting in which one or two enemy machine
guns were still firing.  The telephone was
no longer working.</p>
<p>Outside everything was calm; it was
raining and the road was a river of yellow
mud.  The noise of the guns seemed farther
off, but it was only an illusion, because
one could see the wicked red light of the
shells as they burst over the village in front
of the house.</p>
<p>A few wounded, in hasty field-dressings,
bleeding and muddy, were coming slowly
up to the ambulance in small groups.
Aurelle entered a little fir wood; the wet
pine-needles seemed delightful walking after
the mud.  He heard the guns of the
French battery quite close, but could not
find it.  He had been told: "North-east
corner of the wood."  But where the devil
was the north-east?  All at once a blue
uniform moved among the trees.  At the
same moment a gun went off quite close
to him, and, turning to the right, he saw
the gunners on the edge of the wood well
hidden by some thick bushes.  An adjutant,
astride a chair, tunic undone, <emphasis>képi</emphasis> pushed
back, was in command.  The men served
the gun cleverly and without hurrying, like
skilled workmen.  One might have thought
it a peaceful, open-air factory.</p>
<p>"<emphasis>Mon adjudant</emphasis>," said one of the men,
"here is an interpreter."</p>
<p>"Ah, now, perhaps, we shall find out why
we can't get an answer from the English,"
said the adjutant.</p>
<p>Aurelle gave him the orders, as the
captain was at the observation post, and
the lieutenant trying to repair the telephone.</p>
<p>"Right," said the adjutant, a native of
Lorraine with a quiet, sing-song voice.
"We will demolish it for you, young man."</p>
<p>He telephoned to the captain; then,
having found the cutting on the map, began
his calculations.  Aurelle stayed a few
moments, glad to find this corner of the
battlefield with no false romance, and also
to hear French spoken again at last.</p>
<p>Then he took the path back to the
château.  Cutting across a meadow to find
the high road, he approached the battle-field.
A brigade of reinforcements was going up
in line; he passed it in a contrary direction,
with a few wounded to whom he offered a
little brandy.  The men who were going up
to fight looked at the wounded in silence.</p>
<p>A shell whistled above the column; the
heads bent like poplars in a wind.  The
shell burst in a deserted field.  Then Aurelle,
having passed the brigade, found himself
on the road with the informal procession of
wounded men.  They had fever, they were
dirty, they were bloody; but, thankful to
be out of it, they hurried at the best pace
they could muster towards the haven of
white beds.</p>
<p>A company of German prisoners passed,
guarded by a few Highlanders.  Their
terrified eyes, like those of trained animals,
seemed to be looking for officers to salute.</p>
<p>As Aurelle arrived at the house, he saw
two men in front of him carrying an officer
on a stretcher.  The officer evidently had
some terrible wound, for his body was
covered with dressings through which the
blood had soaked, and was dripping slowly
on to the muddy road.</p>
<p>"Yes, Aurelle, it's I," said the dying man
in a strange voice, and Aurelle recognized
Captain Warburton.  His good-looking,
merry face had become grave.  "O'Grady
will not send me to the Duchess' hospital
this time, messiou," he gasped painfully.
"Will you say good-bye to the colonel for
me—and let him write home that I did not
suffer much.  Hope that won't bother you.
Thanks very much indeed."</p>
<p>Aurelle, without being able to get out a
word, pressed the hand of this maimed boy
who had been so fond of War, and the
stretcher-bearers carried him gently away.</p>
<p>On arriving at the château he found every
one as calm as ever, but very serious.  He
gave in a report of his mission to the Staff
officer, who thanked him absently.</p>
<p>"How is it going?" he asked an operator
in a low voice.</p>
<p>"All right," growled the man.  "All
objectives attained, but the general killed.
Would go himself to see why the Second
Brigade did not come up—a shell buried
him with Major Hall."</p>
<p>Aurelle thought of the grey, smooth hair
and fine features of the general, the gold
and scarlet of his facings all soiled by the
ignoble mud of battles.  So much easy
dignity, he thought, so much courteous
authority, and to-morrow carrion, which the
soldiers will trample under foot without
knowing.  But already, all round him, they
were anxiously discussing who would be
his successor.</p>
<p>In the evening, he went over to the
Lennox with the regiment that was going
to relieve them.  The first person he saw
was the doctor, who was working in a
dug-out.</p>
<p>"I don't think the regiment did badly,"
he said.  "I have not seen the colonel yet,
but all the men tell me he was a marvel of
courage and presence of mind.  It appears,
messiou, that we have the record number
of Germans killed by one man.  Private
Kemble bayoneted twenty-four.  Not bad,
is it?"</p>
<p>"No," said Aurelle, "but it's horrible.
Have you looked at Warburton, doctor?
I met him on the road and he seemed very
bad."</p>
<p>"Done for," said the doctor.  "And his
friend Gibbons died here this afternoon,
both legs blown off."</p>
<p>"Oh, Gibbons too.  Poor Gibbons!  Do
you remember, doctor, his talking about his
plump little wife?  No doubt at this very
moment she is playing tennis with her
sisters in some lovely English garden.  And
the bleeding limbs of her husband are there,
in that blanket.  It's terrible, doctor, all
this."</p>
<p>"Pooh!" answered the doctor, going to
wash his hands, which were covered with
blood.  "In three months you will see her
portrait in the <emphasis>Tatler</emphasis>: 'The beautiful
widow of Captain Gibbons, M.C., who is
shortly to be married to——'"</p>
</section>

<p><strong>CHAPTER XV</strong></p>
<p>The Lennox Highlanders, when the
brigade was relieved, were sent for
six days to a muddy field near
Dickebusch.  Dr. O'Grady and Aurelle
shared a tent, and dined together, the first
evening, at the inn of the <emphasis>Trois Amis</emphasis>.</p>
<p>On their return, the stars shone brightly
in a dark blue velvet sky.  The soft
moonlight lay on the grass of the meadows.  A
few tents in which a light was burning
resembled great white lanterns; round the
bivouac fires, blown about by the wind, the
men sat swearing and singing.</p>
<p>"War makes light of time," said the
doctor, "it is eternal and unalterable.  This
camp might be Cæsar's, the Tommies
round their fires, talking of their wives and
their dangers, their boots and their horses,
like the legionaries of Fabius or the veterans
of the Grand Army.  And, as in those
days, on the other side of the hill, repose
the barbarous Germans by their unyoked
chariots."</p>
<p>The burgundy of the <emphasis>Trois Amis</emphasis> inspired
the doctor to hold forth like
this.</p>
<p>"This tent is six thousand years old,"
he said, "it belongs to the warlike Bedouins
who founded the empires of Babylon and
Carthage.  The restlessness of the ancient
migrating people inspired them with a
longing for the desert every year, and sent them
forth from the city walls on profitable
raids.  It is this same force, Aurelle, which
each summer, before the war, covered the
deserted shores of Europe with nomadic
tents, and it is the dim recollection of
ancestral raids which, on August 1, 1914
holiday time, Aurelle, the time of
migrations—incited the youngest of the barbarians
to let loose their Emperor on the world.
It is an old comedy which has been played
for two thousand years, but the public still
seem to take an interest in it.  It is because
there is always a fresh audience."</p>
<p>"You are pessimistic this evening," said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"What do you call pessimism?" said the
doctor, painfully pulling off his stiff boots.
"I think that men will always have passions,
and that they will never cease to go for
one another at regular intervals with the
most energetic means which the science of
their time can procure for them, and the
best chosen weapons with which to break
each other's bones.  I think that one sex
will always try to please the other, and that
from this elementary desire will eternally
be born the need to vanquish rivals.  With
this object, nightingales, grasshoppers,
prima donnas and statesmen will make use
of their voices; peacocks, niggers and
soldiers, of bright colours; rats, deer,
tortoises and kings will go on fighting.
All that is not pessimism, it is natural
history!"</p>
<p>While talking the doctor had got into
his sleeping-bag, and had seized a little
book from a shelf made out of a biscuit box.</p>
<p>"Listen to this, Aurelle," said he, "and
guess who wrote it.</p>
<p>"'My regrets about the War are
unceasing, and I shall consent to admire your
invincible general when I see the fight
ended under honourable conditions.  It is
true that the brilliant successes which are
your delight are also mine, because these
victories, if we would use fortune wisely,
will procure for us an advantageous peace.
But if we let the moment pass when we
might appear to give peace rather than
receive it, I much fear that this splendid
achievement will vanish in smoke.  And
if fate sends us reverses I tremble to think
of the peace which will be imposed on the
conquered by an enemy who has the courage
to refuse it to the conquerors?'"</p>
<p>"I don't know," said Aurelle, yawning.
"Maximilian Harden?"</p>
<p>"Senator Hanno at the Senate of
Carthage."  said the doctor triumphantly.
"And in two thousand three hundred years
some negro doctor, finding after the Great
African War a speech by Lloyd George,
will say, 'These old sayings are sometimes
very true.'  Your formidable European
War is about as important, Aurelle, as the
fights between two ant-heaps in the corner
of my garden in Ireland."</p>
<p>"It is much more than that to us," said
Aurelle, "and it appears to me that the
sort of sentiments it gives rise to are not
animal.  Do you think that ants are
patriotic?"</p>
<p>"Most certainly," replied the doctor,
"the ants must be extremely patriotic.
With them the warriors are highly fed by
a race of servitors.  Every season their
armies set out to steal the eggs of the
weaker species.  Workers are hatched from
them, born slaves in a foreign country.
The military citizens are thus delivered
from the slavery of work and these soldiers
cannot even feed themselves.  Shut up
with honey, and without their nurse-slaves,
they die of hunger.  That is what is called
civil mobilization.  And if this war lasts
long enough, one day, Aurelle, you will
see a new human species appear: soldier-men.
They will be born with helmets and
armour, impervious to bullets and provided
with natural weapons; the Suffragettes will
be the sexless slaves who will feed these
warriors, while a few queens will, in special
institutions, bring national infants into the
world."</p>
<p>Thus discoursed the doctor, in the friendly
silence of the camp by the soft light of the
moon; and Aurelle, who had gone to sleep,
saw visions of enormous ants in khaki
marching by, commanded by the little doctor.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XVI</strong></p>
<p>The orderlies brought the rum, sugar,
and boiling water.  The padre
began patience, the colonel played
"Destiny Waltz," and Dr. O'Grady, who
in times of peace was doctor at an asylum,
talked about lunatics.</p>
<p>"I had the care of a rich American who
thought he was surrounded by a belt of
poisoned gas," he said.  "In order to save
his life, he had a special bed made for
himself surrounded by a cage of white
wood.  He passed his days in this safe
shelter, dressed in nothing but a red
bathing suit, writing a book in twenty thousand
chapters on the life and works of Adam.
His room had a triple door on which he
had carved, 'Gas carriers are warned that
there are wolf-traps inside.'  He sent for
me every day, and when I went in he
always said, 'I have never seen any creatures
so stupid,' so wicked, so rotten, or so
dense as English doctors.'"</p>
<p>"'I have never seen,'" repeated the padre
with great satisfaction, "'any creatures so
stupid, so wicked, or so dense as English
doctors.'"</p>
<p>"Upon which," continued the doctor,
"he turned his back on me, and, clothed
in his red bathing suit, set to work again
at the twenty-thousandth chapter on the
works of Adam."</p>
<p>"Here, messiou," interrupted the colonel,
who was examining some official papers, "is
some work for you," and he passed over to
Aurelle a thick bundle of papers covered
with multi-coloured seals.</p>
<p>It commenced thus:</p>
<p>"From the Stationmaster at B—— to
the Military Superintendent of the Station
at B——</p>
<p>"I have the honour to inform you that
Mademoiselle Héninghem, gate-keeper at
Hondezeele, complains of the following
facts: the English soldiers camped along
the railway line are in the habit of
performing their ablutions in the open air,
which is a shocking sight for the lady in
question, who, from the nature of her
work, cannot avoid seeing them.  I shall
be obliged if you will give orders that this
regrettable state of affairs shall be put a
stop to as soon as possible."</p>
<p>


(Signature.)</p>
<p>(Seal.)</p>
<p>"From the Military Superintendent of
the Station at B—— to the Superintendent
W——</p>
<p>"Transmitted to the proper quarter."</p>
<p>


(Signed.)</p>
<p>(Seal.)</p>
<p>"The Superintendent W—— to the D.A.D.R.T.</p>
<p>"I shall be obliged if you will give orders
that the camp in question be surrounded
with a fence of sufficient thickness to render
the visibility at fifty yards' distance
practically nil."</p>
<p>"That last man," said Aurelle, "is a
polytechnician."</p>
<p>The padre asked what that was.</p>
<p>"A polytechnician is a man who believes
that all beings, alive or dead, can be
precisely defined and submitted to an
algebraic calculation.  A polytechnician puts,
on the same plane, victory, a tempest,
and love.  I knew one who, commanding
a fortress and having to draw up some
orders in case of aerial attack, began
thus: 'The Fortress of X—— will be
attacked by an aerial engine when a
vertical line from the engine to the earth
finds the centre of the fortification,' and so on."</p>
<p>"Do not abuse the Polytechnic, Aurelle,"
said the doctor.  "It is the most original
of your institutions and the best.  The
personal cult of Napoleon is so well
preserved that each year France presents two
hundred Lieutenant Bonapartes to the
astonished Government."</p>
<p>"Go on translating, messiou," said the
colonel.</p>
<p>"D.A.D.R.T. to the Superintendent.</p>
<p>"This does not concern me but a division
that is resting.  You must address your
claim to the A.G. by the intermediary of
the French Mission."</p>
<p>


(Signed.)</p>
<p>(Seal.)</p>
<p>"Superintendent —— to the Base
Commandant G.H.Q.</p>
<p>"I have the honour to forward herewith,
for any action you consider necessary,
a Memorandum concerning a complaint
from Mademoiselle Héninghem of Hondezeele."</p>
<p>


(Signed.)</p>
<p>(Seal.)</p>
<p>And so it went on: Base Commandant
to the French Mission; French Mission to
the Adjutant-General; A.G. to the Army;
Army to the Corps; Division to the Brigade;
Brigade to the Colonel of the Lennox
Highlanders.  And it was signed with illustrious
names, Colonel, Chief Staff Officer for the
General, Brigadier, Major-General; thus
the modest scruples of Mademoiselle
Héninghem of Hondezeele were clothed, in the
course of a long journey, with purple, gold
and glory.</p>
<p>"This is a tiresome business," said Colonel
Bramble solemnly.  "Parker, answer it,
will you, like a good chap."</p>
<p>The major wrote for several minutes,
then read out:</p>
<p>"This regiment having left the Camp at
Hondezeele two months and a half ago,
it is unfortunately impossible to take the
measures desired in the matter.  Moreover,
having ascertained the great cost of a fence
of sufficient height, I beg to suggest that
it would be more advantageous to the allied
Governments to replace the gate-keeper at
Hondezeele by a person of mature age and
proved experience, to whom the spectacle
described herewith would be inoffensive and
even agreeable."</p>
<p>"No, Parker, no," said the colonel firmly,
"I shall not sign that.  Give me a piece
of paper.  I will answer myself."</p>
<p>He wrote simply:</p>
<p>


"Noted and returned.

"BRAMBLE,</p>
<p>"Colonel."</p>
<p>"You are a wise man, sir," said Parker.</p>
<p>"I know the game," said the colonel.
"I have played it for thirty years."</p>
<p>"Once upon a time," said the doctor,
"there were two officers who, on the same
day, each lost something belonging to His
Majesty's Government.  The first one
mislaid a coal-bucket; the second a
motor-lorry.  Now you must know, Aurelle, that
in our army an officer has to pay for
anything which he may lose by negligence out
of his own pocket.  The two officers,
therefore, received notices from the War Office
advising one that he would have to pay
three shillings, and the other that a thousand
pounds would be stopped from his pay.
The first one wished to defend himself; he
had never had any coal-buckets, and tried
to prove it.  He stopped his promotion, and
in the end had to pay the three bob.  The
second, who knew a thing or two, just
wrote at the bottom of the paper, 'Noted
and returned,' and sent it back to the War
Office.  There, following an old and wise
rule, a clerk lost the correspondence and
the officer never heard anything more of
<emphasis>that</emphasis> little matter."</p>
<p>"That isn't a bad story, doctor," said
Major Parker; "but in the case of the loss
of property belonging to the Government
there is a much better method than
yours—Colonel Boulton's method.</p>
<p>"Colonel Boulton commanded an ammunition
depot.  He was responsible, among
other things, for fifty machine-guns.  One
day he noticed that there were only forty-nine
in the depot.  All the inquiries, and
punishment of the sentries, failed to restore
the missing machine-gun.</p>
<p>"Colonel Boulton was an old fox and had
never acknowledged himself in the wrong.
He simply mentioned in his monthly return
that the tripod of a machine-gun had been
broken.  They sent him a tripod to replace
the other without any comment.</p>
<p>"A month later, on some pretext or
other, he reported the sighting apparatus of
a machine-gun as out of order; the following
month he asked for three screw-nuts;
then a recoil plate, and bit by bit in two
years he entirely destroyed his machine-gun.
And correspondingly, bit by bit, the Army
Ordnance Department reconstructed it for
him without attaching any importance to
the requisitions for the separate pieces.</p>
<p>"Then Colonel Boulton, satisfied at last,
inspected his machine-guns, and found fifty-one.</p>
<p>"While he had been patiently reconstructing
the lost gun, some damned idiot
had found it in a corner.  And Boulton had
to spend two years of clever manipulation
of his books to account for the new gun
which had been evolved out of nothing."</p>
<p>"Messiou," said the colonel, "do you
remember the gate-keeper at Hondezeele?  I
should not have thought it of her."</p>
<p>"No more should I," said Aurelle.  "She
was very pretty."</p>
<p>"Messiou!" said the padre.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XVII</strong></p>
<p>"Doctor," said the padre, "give
me a cigar."</p>
<p>"Are you aware, padre, that
my cigars were rolled on the bare thighs
of the young girls of Havana?"</p>
<p>"O'Grady," said the colonel severely,
"I consider that remark out of place."</p>
<p>"Give me one all the same," said the
padre.  "I must smoke a cigar to help me
find a text for my sermon.  The quartermaster
made me promise to go and see
the motor-drivers who are at the back,
and I don't know what to talk to them
about."</p>
<p>"Look here, padre, I will give you an
appropriate text; lend me your Bible a
moment.  Ah, here it is.  Listen!  'But
David said, Ye shall not do so, my
brethren, with that which the Lord hath
given us ... but as his part is that goeth
down to the battle, so shall his part be that
tarrieth by the stuff; they shall part
alike.'"</p>
<p>"Admirable," said the padre, "admirable!
But tell me, O'Grady, how is it that an
old sinner like you knows the Holy
Scriptures so well?"</p>
<p>"I studied the Book of Samuel a good
deal from an asylum doctor's point of
view," said the doctor.  "Saul's neurasthenia
interested me.  His attacks are very well
described.  I have also diagnosed the
madness of Nebuchadnezzar.  They were two
very different types.  Saul was apathetic
and Nebuchadnezzar violent."</p>
<p>"I wish you would leave Nebuchadnezzar
alone," said the colonel.</p>
<p>"I am very much afraid of asylum
doctors," said Major Parker.  "Violent,
depressed, or apathetic, we are all mad,
according to them."</p>
<p>"What do you call mad?" said the
doctor.  "I certainly can see in you, and
in the colonel, and Aurelle, all the
phenomena which I observed in the asylum."</p>
<p>"Ugh!" said the colonel, horrified.</p>
<p>"But I do, sir.  Between Aurelle, who
forgets the war by reading Tolstoi, and
some of my old friends who thought they
were Napoleon or Mahomet, there is a
difference in degree but not in nature.
Aurelle browses on novels from a morbid
desire to live the life of someone else;
my patients substitute for their miserable
life that of some great personage whose
history they have read and whose lot they
envy.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know your objections, Aurelle.
You know, all the time you are dreaming
of the loves of Prince Bolkonsky, that
you are the Interpreter Aurelle, attached
to the Lennox Highlanders, but when
Queen Elizabeth is scrubbing the floor
of my office, she does not know that she
is Mrs. Jones, charwoman, of Hammersmith.
But incoherence is not the monopoly
of madness: all the main ideas of a sane
man are irrational erections built up, for
better or worse, to express his deepest
feelings."</p>
<p>"Parker," said the colonel, "can you
think of anything to stop him?"</p>
<p>"A No. 5 grenade, sir," said the major.</p>
<p>But the doctor went on imperturbably:</p>
<p>"One of my patients was a country
gentleman, who after being a model of
piety for the first part of his life suddenly
became an atheist.  He gave carefully
thought out reasons for it, and discoursed
with a good deal of erudition on questions
of doctrine, but the only true cause of his
conversion to the wrong side was because
his wife ran away with the clergyman of
his village.  Oh, I beg your pardon, padre,
you don't mind, do you?"</p>
<p>"I?  I have not been listening to you
for ages," said the padre, who was dealing
out patience.</p>
<p>"It is just the same thing," continued the
doctor, turning to the docile Aurelle, "with
a man who is too refined for the class in
which chance has placed him.  At first he
is simply jealous and unhappy.  Influenced
by these feelings, he becomes violently
critical of society in order to account for
his hate and disappointment.</p>
<p>"Nietzsche was a genius because he
delighted in persecution.  Karl Marx was a
dangerous maniac.  It is only when the
feelings of discontent which he tries to
explain coincide with those of a whole
class, or a whole nation, that the
impassioned theorist becomes a prophet, or a
hero; while, if he confines himself to
explaining that he would rather have been
born an Emperor, they shut him up."</p>
<p>"Moral," said the major, "shut up all
theorists."</p>
<p>"And the doctor," said the colonel.</p>
<p>"No, not all," said the doctor.  "We
treat the subject just as the ancients did.
All primitive people thought that a lunatic
was possessed by a spirit.  When his
incoherent words more or less accord with
the moral prejudices of the time, the spirit
is a good one, and the man is a saint.  In
the opposite case, the spirit is evil and the
man must be suppressed.  It is just according
to the time and place and the doctors,
whether a prophetess would be worshipped
as a priestess or ducked as a witch.
Innumerable violent lunatics have escaped the
cells, thanks to the War, and their very
violence has made heroes of them.  And
in every Parliament there are at least five
or six undisputed idiots who got elected for
their madness, through the admiration of
their constituents."</p>
<p>"Say five or six hundred," said Major
Parker, "and it will be the first sensible
thing you have said to-night."</p>
<p>"That's because my madness agrees
with yours on that subject," said the
doctor.</p>
<p>"Doctor," said the colonel, "you understand
treatment by suggestion, don't you?
I wish you would calm down your hospital
sergeant a bit.  He is so nervous that he
begins to tremble and becomes perfectly
speechless if I speak to him.  I really
believe I terrify him.  See what you can do,
like a good fellow."</p>
<p>Next morning, Dr. O'Grady sent for
Sergeant Freshwater to his tent and talked
kindly to him.</p>
<p>Freshwater, a lean Albino with heavy
stupid eyes, owned that he lost his head
whenever the colonel came near him.</p>
<p>"Well, my friend," said the doctor, "we
will cure you of that in five minutes.  Sit
down there."</p>
<p>He made some passes to create an
atmosphere favourable to suggestion, then
began:</p>
<p>"You are not afraid of the colonel, you
know he is a man just like you and me—you
rather like talking to him.  Look
closely at his face when he speaks to you.
His moustache is always cut a little too
short on the left side."</p>
<p>The doctor went on like this for a
quarter of an hour describing the rugged
features and funny ways of the colonel,
then sent away the sergeant, telling him
that he was cured, and not to forget
it the first time he met his commanding
officer.</p>
<p>A few hours later, Colonel Bramble,
going out for his lunch, met the hospital
sergeant on one of the duck-boards used
for going through the camp.  Freshwater
stepped on one side, saluted, and began to
laugh silently.</p>
<p>"Whatever is the matter, sergeant?"
said the astonished colonel.</p>
<p>"Oh, sir," replied Freshwater in fits of
laughter, "I cannot help laughing when
I look at you, you have such a funny face!"</p>
<p>The colonel, in a few well-chosen words,
destroyed the doctor's learned suggestions
for ever; then, establishing himself in front
of the tinned lobster, he complimented
O'Grady on his miraculous cure.</p>
<p>"I have never seen," said the padre,
"any creatures so stupid, so wicked, so
rotten, or so dense as English doctors."</p>
<p>"Medicine is a very old joke," said Major
Barker, "but it still goes on.  Now, doctor,
tell the truth for once: what do you know
more than we do about illnesses and their remedies?"</p>
<p>"That's right," said the padre, "attack
his religion; he often attacks mine."</p>
<p>"When I was in India," said the colonel,
"an old army doctor gave me for every
malady the remedy which just suited me.
For palpitations of the heart, a large glass
of brandy; for insomnia, three or four
glasses of port after dinner; for stomachic
disorders, a bottle of dry champagne at
each meal.  And, as long as one was feeling
well, whisky and soda."</p>
<p>"Excellent, sir," said Aurelle.  "Before
the War I drank nothing but water and
I was always ill; since I have been with
you I have adopted whisky and I feel much
better."</p>
<p>"Yes, you look it," said the colonel.  "I
had a friend, Major Fetherstonhaugh, who
began to have fits of dizziness when he
was about forty; he went to see a doctor
who thought it was the whisky and advised
him to drink milk for a time; well, in ten
days he was dead."</p>
<p>"And a good thing too," said the padre.</p>
<p>"But I expect——" began the doctor.</p>
<p>"Happy are those who expect nothing,"
said the padre, "for they shall not be
disappointed."</p>
<p>"What, you too, padre!" said the doctor.
"Take care; if you ruin doctors by your
malevolent remarks, I shall found a society
for the exportation to the Colonies of
mechanical idols and ovens for cooking
missionaries."</p>
<p>"That is an excellent idea," said the
padre.  "I must see about it."</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XVIII</strong></p>
<p>The brigade, kept in reserve for the
division, was ordered to go and
camp at H——.  As a dentist
measures the extent of a cavity at a glance,
the men of the Lennox, expert in bombardments,
cast a professional eye over the
village.  Round the château and the church
it was done for: houses in ruins, pavements
torn up, trees smashed.  The weaving
factory had been badly damaged.  The
rest was not so unhealthy, a little knocked
about, perhaps, but habitable.</p>
<p>The house where Colonel Bramble had
established his Mess had already been hit
by a shell.  It had burst in the garden,
breaking the window-panes and marking
the walls.  Madame, a dear little old lady,
made light of these blemishes, which had
depreciated her house in value.</p>
<p>"Oh, just a shell, <emphasis>monsieur l'officier</emphasis>!"
she said.  "Quite a small shell; I put the
base of it there on my mantelpiece.  It's
nothing, as you can see.  True, they make
a mess of everything, but I am not afraid of them!"</p>
<p>The colonel asked her how many windows had been broken.</p>
<p>"I don't like this house," said the padre,
as they sat down to dinner.</p>
<p>"The life of a soldier," replied the colonel,
"is one of great hardship, not infrequently
mingled with moments of real danger."</p>
<p>"Be not dismayed, padre," said the
doctor.  "Shells fall like drops of water:
if it rains much the whole pavement gets wet."</p>
<p>"The Lennox Mess has always been
lucky," said Major Parker.</p>
<p>"Luck is nothing," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"One can see you are not a gambler,"
remarked Aurelle.</p>
<p>"One can see that you are not a
mathematician," said the doctor.</p>
<p>The padre expostulated:</p>
<p>"What?  Luck nothing?  How about
little Taylor, killed by a shell in Poperinghe
Station at the very moment that he was
arriving at the front for the first time!
You don't call that bad luck?"</p>
<p>"Not more than if an old habitué like
me was wiped out by a whizz-bang, padre.
You are astonished at Taylor being killed
the first minute, just as you would be
surprised if, in a lottery of a million tickets,
Number One should win, although that
number had obviously as much chance as,
say, 327,645.  Someone must be the last
man killed in this war, but you will see
that his family will not think it ordinary."</p>
<p>"You are a fanatic, O'Grady," said
Parker, "you must have an explanation
for everything; there are more things in
heaven and earth than are dreamed of in
your philosophy.  I believe, myself, in good
luck and bad luck because I have noticed
it: I believe in presentiments because I
have had them, and events have confirmed
them.  When I was being sent home, after
the Transvaal War, I got an order to
embark on a certain ship.  Well, two days
before it started I suddenly had a
presentiment that I must avoid sailing in that
ship at all costs.  I went sick and waited
a fortnight longer.  The transport I missed
was completely lost and no one ever knew
how.  Then again, why are you so certain,
doctor, that aspirin will cure your
headache?  Because aspirin has cured it before.
Where's the difference?"</p>
<p>"The major is right," said Aurelle.  "To
say that you do not believe in a man's bad
luck because you cannot find it at his
autopsy, is like saying that the tuner has
taken the piano to pieces, and therefore
Mozart had no soul."</p>
<p>The quartermaster, who was dining with
them that evening, threw his weight into
discussion:</p>
<p>"There <emphasis>are</emphasis> things that cannot be
explained, doctor.  For instance, I hit you
in the face: you shut your eye—why?"</p>
<p>There was an astounded silence.</p>
<p>"Another instance," remarked the padre
at last.  "Why is it that if there is a pause
in the conversation, it is always twenty
minutes to, or twenty minutes past, the hour?"</p>
<p>"But that's not true," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"It was true this time, anyhow," said
Aurelle, looking at his watch.</p>
<p>"It may be once or twice," said the
doctor irritably, "but it cannot always happen."</p>
<p>"All right, doctor, all right," said the
padre.  "You notice it for several days
and I think you will change your mind."</p>
<p>The colonel said:</p>
<p>"My men tell me that if a shell falls on
a dug-out where there are gunners and
infantry, the latter are killed and the
gunners are spared.  Why?"</p>
<p>"But it is not true, sir."</p>
<p>"And why must one never light three
cigarettes with the same match?"</p>
<p>"But you may, sir, it does not matter
a bit."</p>
<p>"Ah, there I disagree with you, doctor,"
said the colonel.  "I am not superstitious,
but I would not do that for anything in the
world."</p>
<p>"Why do people dressed in green always
lose at Monte Carlo?" said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"But it is not true!" roared the doctor,
exasperated.</p>
<p>"It is easy to argue like you," said
Parker.  "Everything you do not agree
with is not true."</p>
<p>"There are," said the padre, "no creatures
so wicked and so dense as English
doctors."</p>
<p>"Messiou," said the colonel, "are the
gunners equally lucky in the French Army?"</p>
<p>"I have often remarked it," said Aurelle,
who liked Colonel Bramble very much.</p>
<p>The colonel therefore triumphed, and
tried to put an end to the discussion, which
bored him.</p>
<p>"I am so very sorry," he said, "I cannot
give you the gramophone to-night.  I have
no more needles."</p>
<p>"That <emphasis>is</emphasis> a pity," said the padre.</p>
<p>The window-panes shook; a big gun
went off close to the house.  Aurelle went
to the window and saw behind a farm,
silhouetted in black against the orange
twilight of the sky, a yellowish smoke, slowly
dispersing.</p>
<p>"There's the old man beginning to strafe
again," said the padre.  "I don't like this
house."</p>
<p>"You will have to put up with it, padre;
the Staff captain won't give us another;
he's a boy who knows his own mind."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the colonel, "he is a very
nice boy too; he is one of Lord Bamford's
sons."</p>
<p>"His father, the old Lord, was a fine
rider," said Parker.</p>
<p>"His sister," replied the colonel, "married
a cousin of Graham, who was a major
in our first battalion at the beginning of the
War, and is now a brigadier-general."</p>
<p>Aurelle, foreseeing that such an interesting
subject, so rich in the possibility of
unexpected developments, would occupy
the entire evening, tried to scribble some
verses, still meditating on luck and chance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Tu l'as dit, ô Pascal, le nez de Cléopâtre,</p>
<p>S'il eût été plus court ... nous n'en serions pas là."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A new and formidable detonation put
the subtle metre of rhyme out of his head;
discouraged, he tried another:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Croyez pas que je moralise,</p>
<p>Si je vous envoie ces bobards,</p>
<p>C'est que notre mess analyse</p>
<p>Ce soir la question du hasard..."</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another shell fell so close that the colonel
got up suddenly.</p>
<p>"They are beginning to bombard the
château again," he said.  "I am going to
see where that one fell."</p>
<p>Major Parker and the doctor followed
him into the street, but Aurelle, who was
again rhyming, stayed with the padre, who
had just begun the same patience for the
fourteenth time that evening.  The three
officers had gone about a hundred yards
when another explosion took place behind
them.</p>
<p>"That one was not far from the Mess,"
said the doctor.  "I am going to tell
Madame to go down into the cellar."</p>
<p>He retraced his steps and found a new
shell-hole in front of the house.  The house
seemed all right; through the broken
window the doctor saw the padre and called
out to him:</p>
<p>"A near thing that time, padre.  Are
you all right?  Where is Aurelle?"</p>
<p>But the padre did not move: with his
head leaning on his arms crossed over the
scattered cards, he appeared to be gazing
vaguely at the doctor, who entered at a
bound and touched the padre on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>He was dead.  A piece of shell had
entered his temple, which was bleeding
slowly.  Aurelle had fallen on the floor.
He was unconscious and covered with
blood, but the doctor, bending over him,
found that he still breathed.  As he
was unfastening his tunic and shirt, the
colonel and Parker arrived with their
measured tread and stopped abruptly at
the door.</p>
<p>"The padre has been killed, sir," said the
doctor simply.  "Aurelle is hit, too, but
I don't think it is serious.  No, it's his
shoulder—nothing much."</p>
<p>The colonel groaned sympathetically.</p>
<p>Parker helped O'Grady to lay the Frenchman
on a table; a crumpled piece of paper
attracted the colonel's attention; he picked
it up and read with difficulty:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Pourquoi me fermes-tu les yeux</p>
<p>Lorsque tu me baises la bouche?"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>"What is it all about?" he said.</p>
<p>"It belongs to Aurelle," said the doctor.</p>
<p>The colonel carefully folded the little
sheet of paper and slid it respectfully into
the young Frenchman's pocket.  Then, after
the doctor had finished dressing the wound
and had sent for an ambulance, they laid
the padre on Madame's humble bed.  They
all took their hats off and stood silent for
some time contemplating the strangely
softened features of the childlike old man.</p>
<p>The doctor looked at his watch; it was
twenty minutes past nine.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XIX</strong></p>
<p>Aurelle, on leaving hospital, was
attached, while convalescent, to the
English colonel, Musgrave, who
commanded a supply depot at Estrées, a
little village well behind the line.  He
missed the evenings with the Lennox Mess,
but buying fodder and wood took him some
way out into the pretty undulating country
with its clear streams, and he loved Estrées,
hiding its innumerable belfries among the
flowery hills.</p>
<p>It was a very antique city, and in its
youth, in the time of the <emphasis>seigneurs</emphasis> of
Estrées, had played an important part in
the affairs of France.  For several hundred
years she had defended her ramparts against
the troops of the Kings of England, and
from her walls she could see those same
soldiers to-day camped about her, this time
as familiar and courteous guests.  Her
tenacious burghers had repulsed both
Leaguers and Spaniards with equal success.
She now slept in smiling old age, having
seen too many things to be surprised any
more, while still retaining from the times
of her glory her casket of beautiful mansions,
built among courts and gardens with the
noble simplicity of line dating from the best
periods.</p>
<p>Colonel Musgrave and his officers
inhabited the large and handsome house of
the Dutch merchant, Van Mopez, whom
Colbert had established at Estrées to
introduce the art of weaving and dyeing cloth.
Aurelle liked to go and sit in the garden
and read a History of Estrées written by
Monsieur Jean Valines, correspondence
member of the Amiens Academy, and
author of "Nouvelles observations sur les
miracles de la chapelle d'Estrées."</p>
<p>This excellent work contained accounts
of the great rejoicings and high festivals
with which Estrées the Faithful had received
the Kings, when they came to kneel and
worship at the feet of the miraculous image
in the Chapel of St. Ferréol.</p>
<p>The municipal worthies, between the
royal visits, prudently and carefully
preserved the white and blue draperies
embroidered with fleurs-de-lis, and the
decorations of painted scenery.</p>
<p>The Revolution had rather upset these
domestic arrangements; the fleurs-de-lis had
to be removed and a red fringe sewn along
the blue and white draperies, so that the
square of Saint-Ferréol could be decorated
at a small cost for the fête of the Supreme
Being.  Aurelle loved the description:</p>
<p>"The cortège, preceded by music and
drums, consisted first of a half-company of
the National Guard carrying a banner on
which was inscribed: 'Up with the People,
down with Tyrants.'</p>
<p>"Then came the mothers of families
carrying their infants in their arms; children
of both sexes clothed in the most beautiful
ornaments of their age—innocence and
candour; young girls adorned with their
charms and virtues; and the members of
that Society so dreaded by traitors, in which
were united the defenders of the truth, the
upholders of public opinion, and the
indefatigable guardians of the people.</p>
<p>"The whole cortège gathered at the foot
of a mound erected in the square of Saint-Ferréol.
There, the people of Estrées swore
fidelity to the laws of nature and humanity,
and subsequently a group of figures
representing Despotism and Imposture were
consumed by flames; Wisdom arose out of
the ashes and on his shield was written:
'I guard the Republic.'"</p>
<p>Aurelle turned over some pages, very
few, for, as Monsieur Jean Valines said, the
happy sterility of the archives of Estrées
during the Revolution recorded no other
facts worthy of notice than two fêtes, a fire,
and a flood.  Next came the visit of the
First Consul.  He came to Estrées
accompanied by his wife and several general
officers, and was received by the authorities
under a triumphal arch, erected at the
Saint-Ferréol Gate, adorned with this
inscription: "The Grateful Inhabitants of
this City swear Allegiance and Fidelity
to the Conqueror of Marengo."</p>
<p>The Mayor presented the keys of the
town on a silver dish covered with bay
leaves.  "I take them, <emphasis>citoyen maire</emphasis>, and I
return them to you," replied Bonaparte.</p>
<p>"The National Guard lined the route
and cries of 'Long live Bonaparte!  Long
live the First Consul!' were repeated
enthusiastically a thousand times.  The First
Consul visited the Van Mopez factory and
distributed a day's pay among the workmen.
The day ended with illuminations and a
brilliant ball.</p>
<p>"A short time after his marriage with
Marie-Louise, Napoleon came back,
accompanied by the Empress.  The square of
Saint-Ferréol was a magnificent spectacle,
decorated with red and white draperies and
garlands of green leaves.  A triumphal
arch had been erected with the inscription:
'<emphasis>Augusto Napoleoni Augustæque Mariæ
Ludovicæ Strataville semper fidelis</emphasis>.'"</p>
<p>A few more pages further on and it was
March, 1814; for six days no couriers got
through to Estrées from Paris, and then she
heard of the fall of the Emperor.</p>
<p>"At three o'clock in the afternoon, the
magistrates, assembled in the Town Hall,
summoned the inhabitants with the ringing
of bells.  The Mayor appeared on the
balcony of the large hall and proclaimed
the allegiance of the town to the restored
Bourbons.  The spectators received this
speech with oft-repeated cries of 'Long live
the King!' 'Long live Louis XVIII!'
and all put on the white cockade.</p>
<p>"The news soon came that Louis XVIII
had landed at Calais and that he would
pass through Estrées.  A guard of honour
was formed and a triumphal arch was
erected at the Saint-Ferréol gate.  It bore
this inscription: '<emphasis>Regibus usque suis urbs
Stratavilla fidelis</emphasis>.'</p>
<p>"The clergy from every parish approached
to compliment the King, and the Mayor
presented the keys of the town on a silver
dish adorned with fleurs-de-lis.  The King
replied, 'Monsieur le maire, I take the
flowers, and give you back the keys.'  Then
the sailors and footmen unharnessed the
horses from the carriage, and drew him
themselves into the town.  The excitement
of the crowd was impossible to describe;
every house was decorated with blue and
white draperies and green garlands, mottoes
and white flags, covered with fleurs-de-lis.</p>
<p>"The King was present at a <emphasis>Te Deum</emphasis>
sung in Saint-Ferréol, and repaired, still
drawn by sailors, to the Abbey of
Saint-Pierre, where he was to lodge the night."</p>
<p>The evening drew slowly in; the quaint,
thick lettering of the old book was
becoming indistinct, but Aurelle wanted to
finish the melancholy history of these
inconstant people.  Skipping the triumphal
entry of Charles X, he came to the July
insurrection.</p>
<p>"On the 29th of July, 1830, there were
no newspapers; but letters and a few
travellers arriving from Paris announced
that the tricolour flag had been hoisted on
the towers of Notre-Dame.  A few days
later they learnt that the fighting had
stopped, and that the heroic population of
the capital remained in possession of all their
outposts.</p>
<p>"Louis-Philippe, accompanied by the
Dukes of Orleans and Nemours, soon after
passed Estrées on his way to Lille.  He
was received under a triumphal arch by the
Mayor and Corporation.  Every house was
hung with draperies in the three colours.
An immense crowd filled the air with their
acclamations.  The King arrived at the
square of Saint-Ferréol, where the National
Guard and several companies of <emphasis>douaniers</emphasis>
awaited him.</p>
<p>"The various corps of the urban guards
in their best clothes; the strangeness of
the rural guards, with a large number of
Napoleon's old soldiers in their ranks with
their original uniforms; the intrepid
seamen of Cayeux carrying in triumph their
fishing prizes, ten old tricolour banners; the
sailors, with their carbines, bandoliers and
cutlasses in their hands, all made the gayest
of spectacles, and the picturesque fête
delighted the King and the officers of his
staff."</p>
<p>There Jean Valines' book concluded, but
Aurelle, while watching the garden fading
slowly in the twilight, amused himself by
imagining what followed.  A visit from
Lamartine, no doubt; then one from Napoleon
III, the triumphal arches and inscriptions,
and quite lately, perhaps, Carnot or
Fallières receiving from the mayor, in the
square of Saint-Ferréol, the assurance of
the unalterable devotion of the faithful
people of Estrées to the Republic.  Then in
the future: unknown governors, the decorations,
perhaps red, perhaps blue, until the
day when some blind god would come and
crush with his heel this venerable human
ant-hill.</p>
<p>"And each time," he mused, "the enthusiasm
is sincere and the vows loyal, and
these honest tradesmen rejoice to see
passing through their ancient portals the new
rulers, in the choice of whom they have
had no part.</p>
<p>"Happy province!  You quietly accept
the Empires which Paris brings forth with
pain, and the downfall of a government
means no more to you than changing the
words of a speech or the flowers on a silver
dish.  If Dr. O'Grady were here he would
quote Ecclesiastes to me."</p>
<p>He tried to remember it:</p>
<p>"What profit hath a man of all his labour
which he taketh under the sun?</p>
<p>"One generation passeth away, and
another generation cometh; but the earth
abideth for ever.</p>
<p>"The thing that hath been, it is that
which shall be; and that which is done is
that which shall be done; and there is no
new thing under the sun."</p>
<p>"Aurelle," said Colonel Musgrave, who
had quietly approached, "if you want to
see the bombardment after dinner, go up
to the top of the hill.  The sky is all lit
up.  We attack to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>And a distant muffled thundering floated
on the calm evening air.  A melancholy
and ancient peal of bells rang out from the
Spanish belfry in the market-place.  The
first stars twinkled above the two ironical
towers of the church of Saint-Ferréol and
the proud old town fell asleep to the familiar
sound of battle.</p>
</section>
<section>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XX</strong></p>
<p>Colonel Musgrave was drinking
his coffee in the handsome <emphasis>salon</emphasis> of
the merchant, Van Mopez; he
opened a pink official telegram and read:</p>
<p>"Director of Commissariat to Colonel
Musgrave.  Marseilles Indian Depot
overcrowded meet special train 1000 goats with
native goatherds find suitable quarters and
organize temporary farm."</p>
<p>"Damn the goats!" he said.</p>
<p>His job being to feed Australians, he
thought it hard that he had to bear in
addition the consequences of the religious
laws of the Hindoos.  But nothing troubled
Colonel Musgrave long; he sent for his
interpreter.</p>
<p>"Aurelle," he said, "I am expecting a
thousand goats this evening; you will take
my motor and scour the country.  I must
have a suitable piece of ground in five
hours and a small building for the shepherds.
If the owner refuses to let you hire them,
you will commandeer them.  Have a cigar?
Good-bye."</p>
<p>Having thus disposed of this first
anxiety, he turned to his adjutant.</p>
<p>"We now want an O.C Goats!" he said.
"It will be an excellent reason for
getting rid of Captain Cassell, who arrived
yesterday.  <emphasis>Captain</emphasis>!  I asked him what
he did in peace-time—musical critic of the
<emphasis>Morning Leader</emphasis>!"</p>
<p>So that is how Captain Cassell, musical
critic, was promoted goatherd-in-chief.
Aurelle found a farmer's wife whose
husband had been called up, and he
persuaded her, at the cost of much eloquence,
that the presence of a thousand goats in
her orchards would be the beginning of
all sorts of prosperity.  He went in the
evening to the station with Cassell to
fetch the goats, and they both passed
through the town at the head of the
picturesque flock, herded by ancient
Indians, who looked exactly like the
shepherds in the Bible.</p>
<p>Colonel Musgrave ordered Cassell to
send him a hundred goats per day for
the front.  After the fourth day Cassell
sent over a short note by one of the
children from the farm, announcing, as if
it were quite a natural thing, that his
flock would be exhausted the next day
and asking for another contingent of goats.</p>
<p>On opening this extraordinary missive,
the colonel was so choked with rage that
he forgot to proclaim, according to custom,
that Cassell was a damned fool.  The
numbers were too simple for an error to
be possible.  Cassell had received one
thousand goats; he had sent off four
hundred, he ought to have six hundred
left.</p>
<p>The colonel ordered his car and
commanded Aurelle to take him to the farm.
A pretty, deeply cut road led them there.
The buildings were in the rustic, solid style
of the end of the eighteenth century.</p>
<p>"It is a charming spot," said the
interpreter, proud of his find.</p>
<p>"Where is that damned fellow Cassell?"
said the colonel.</p>
<p>They found him in the kitchen having
a French lesson from the farmer's daughter.
He got up with the easy grace of a rural
gentleman whom friends from town had
surprised in his hermitage.</p>
<p>"Hullo, colonel," he said, "I am very
glad to see you."</p>
<p>The colonel went straight to the point:</p>
<p>"What's this damned letter that you
sent me this morning?  You received a
thousand goats; you sent me four hundred
of them.  Show me the others."</p>
<p>The ground behind the farm sloped
gently down to a wooded valley; it was
planted with apple-trees.  Near a stable,
sitting in the mud, the Hindoo shepherds
tasted prematurely the joys of Nirvana.</p>
<p>A horrible smell arose from the valley,
and, coming nearer, the colonel saw about
a hundred swollen and rotting carcases of
goats scattered about the enclosure.  A
few thin kids dismally gnawed the bark of
the apple-trees.  In the distance, among
the copses which covered the other side of
the valley, one could see goats which had
escaped browsing on the young trees.  At
this lamentable sight, Aurelle pitied the
unfortunate Cassell.</p>
<p>The colonel maintained a hostile and
dangerous silence.</p>
<p>"Isn't it beautiful, colonel," said the
musical critic with soft and stilted speech,
"to see all those little white spots among
the green?"</p>
<p>*      *      *      *      *</p>
<p>"Could not one," suggested Aurelle on
the return journey, "ask the advice of a
competent man?  Perhaps goats cannot
stand sleeping out of doors in this damp
climate, and perhaps also they are not
being fed properly."</p>
<p>The colonel frowned.</p>
<p>"In the South African war," he said
after a silence, "we used a large number
of oxen for our transport.  One day these
damned oxen started dying by hundreds,
and no one knew why.  Great excitement
at headquarters.  Some general found an
expert, who, after boring the whole army
with his questions, ended by declaring
that the oxen were cold.  He had
noticed the same sickness in the north of
India.  There they protected the beasts
by making them wear special clothing.
Any normal individual with common sense
could see that the oxen were simply
overworked.  But the report followed its
course, and arrived at general headquarters,
and from there they wired to India for
a few thousand rugs for cattle.</p>
<p>"So far all went well, the oxen died as
fast as ever, the well-paid expert had a
damned good time—up to the arrival of
the rugs.  It is very easy to put
clothing on an Indian cow who waits patiently
with lowered head.  But an African bullock—you
try, and see what it's like.  After
several trials, our drivers refused to do it.
They sent for the expert and said to him,
'You asked for rugs for the beasts: here
they are.  Show us how to put them on.'  He
was damned lucky to get out of
hospital in six months."</p>
<p>That same evening another pink telegram
arrived from the Director of Commissariat:</p>
<p>"Goats arrive at the front half dead
pray take steps that these animals may
have some wish to live."</p>
<p>Colonel Musgrave then decided to telegraph
to Marseilles and ask for an expert
on goats.</p>
<p>The expert arrived two days later, a
fat farmer from the South, sergeant of
Territorials.  With the help of Aurelle, he
had a long conversation with the colonel.</p>
<p>"There is one thing," he said, "that
goats cannot get on without, and that is
heat.  You must make very low wooden
sheds for them; without any openings; let
them stew in their own juice, and they will
be happy!"</p>
<p>He remarked to the interpreter when the
colonel had gone, "Didn't I tell them a
good tale about their goats, <emphasis>hé</emphasis>?  In the
South they live out in the open and are
as well as you or I.  But let's talk seriously.
Couldn't you get your English to manage
an extension of leave for me, to look after
their beasts, <emphasis>hé</emphasis>?"</p>
<p>They had begun to build the huts
described by the man from the South, when
the Indian Corps wrote to Colonel Musgrave
that they had discovered a British expert
whom they were sending him.</p>
<p>The new seer was an artillery officer, but
goats filled his life.  Aurelle, who looked
after him a good deal, found out that he
regarded everything in nature from the
point of view of a goat.  A Gothic cathedral,
according to him, was a poor shelter for
goats: not enough air, but that could be
remedied by breaking the windows.</p>
<p>His first advice was to mix molasses with
the fodder which was given to the animals.
It was supposed to fatten them and cure
them of that distinguished melancholy
which the Indian troops complained of.
Large bowls of molasses were therefore
distributed to the Hindoo shepherds.  The
goats remained thin and sad, but the
shepherds grew fat.  These results surprised
the expert.</p>
<p>Then he was shown the plans of the huts.</p>
<p>He was astounded.</p>
<p>"If there is one thing in the world that
goats cannot do without," he said, "it is
air.  They must have very lofty stables
with large windows."</p>
<p>Colonel Musgrave asked him no more.
He thanked him with extreme politeness,
then sent for Aurelle.</p>
<p>"Now listen to me," he said: "you know
Lieutenant Honeysuckle, the goat expert?
Well, I never wish to see him again.  I
order you to go and find a new farm with
him.  I forbid you to find it.  If you can
manage to drown him, to run over him
with my car, or to get him eaten by the
goats, I will recommend you for the Military
Cross.  If he reappears here before my
huts are finished, I will have you shot.
Be off!"</p>
<p>A week later Lieutenant Honeysuckle
broke his leg by falling off his horse in a
farmyard.  The Territorial from Marseilles
was sent back to his corps.  As for the
goats, one fine day they stopped dying, and
no one ever found out why.</p>
<p><strong>CHAPTER XXI</strong></p>
<p>One morning, Aurelle, seeing an
English Staff officer come into
his office in a gold-peaked hat
with a red band, was surprised and delighted
to recognize Major Parker.</p>
<p>"Hullo, sir!  I <emphasis>am</emphasis> glad to see you again!
But you never told me about that"—and
he pointed to the signs of authority.</p>
<p>"Well," said the major, "I wrote and
told you that Colonel Bramble had been
made a general.  He now commands our
old brigade and I am his brigade major.
I have just been down to the Base to
inspect our reinforcements, and the general
ordered me to pick you up on the way
back and bring you in to lunch.  He will
send you back this evening.  Your colonel
is quite agreeable.  We are camped for
the moment next to the village where the
padre was killed; the general thought you
would like to see his grave."</p>
<p>Two hours later they drew near the front
and Aurelle recognized the familiar
landmarks: the little English military village
with a policeman holding up his hand at
every corner; the large market town,
scarcely bombarded, but having here and
there a roof with its beams exposed; the
road, where one occasionally met a man
in a flat steel helmet loaded like a mule;
the village, the notice boards, "This road
is under observation," and suddenly, a
carefully camouflaged battery barking out of a
thicket.</p>
<p>But Major Parker, who had seen these
things every day for three years, discoursed
on one of his favourite themes:</p>
<p>"The soldier, Aurelle, is always done
in by the tradesman and the politician.
England will pay ten thousand a year to
a lawyer or a banker, but when she has
splendid fellows like me who conquer
empires and keep them for her, she only
gives them just enough to keep their polo
ponies.  And again——"</p>
<p>"It is just the same in France——"
began Aurelle; but the car stopped
suddenly opposite the church of a nightmare
village, and he recognized H——.  "Poor
old village, how it has changed!" he said.</p>
<p>The church, ashamed, now showed its
profaned nave; the few houses still
standing were merely two triangles of stone
sadly facing one another; and the high
building of the weaving factory, hit by a
shell in the third story, was bent over like
a poplar in a storm.</p>
<p>"Will you follow me?" said the major.
"We have had to put the H.Q. of the
brigade outside the village, which was
becoming unhealthy.  Walk twenty paces
behind me; the sausage balloon is up and
it's no good showing them the road."</p>
<p>Aurelle followed for a quarter of an hour
through the bushes, and suddenly found
himself face to face with General Bramble
who, standing at the entrance to a dug-out,
was watching a suspicious aeroplane.</p>
<p>"Ah, messiou!" he said.  "That's good!"  And
the whole of his rugged red face lit
up with a kindly smile.</p>
<p>"It will be like a lunch in the old days,"
he continued, after Aurelle had congratulated
him.  "I sent the Staff captain out
with the interpreter—for we have another
interpreter now, messiou—I thought you
would not like to see him in your place.
But he has not really replaced you, messiou;
and I telephoned to the Lennox to send
the doctor to lunch with us."</p>
<p>He showed them into the Mess and gave
Major Parker a few details of what had
been happening.</p>
<p>"Nothing important; they have spoilt
the first line a bit at E 17 A.  We had a
little strafe last night.  The division wanted
a prisoner, so as to identify the Boche
reliefs—yes, yes, that was all right—the
Lennox went to fetch him.  I have seen
the man, but I haven't had their written
report yet."</p>
<p>"What, not since last night?" said Parker.
"What else have they got to do?"</p>
<p>"You see, messiou," said the general,
"the good old times are over.  Parker no
longer abuses red hats.  No doubt they are
abusing him in that little wood you see
down there."</p>
<p>"It is true," said Parker, "that one must
be on the Staff to realize the importance
of work done there.  The Staff is really a
brain without which no movement of the
regiments is possible."</p>
<p>"You hear, messiou?" said the general.
"It is no longer the same; it will never be
the same again.  The padre will not be
there to talk to us about Scotland and to
abuse bishops.  And I have no longer got
my gramophone, messiou.  I left it to the
regiment with all my records.  The life of
the soldier is one of great hardship, messiou,
but we had a jolly little Mess with the
Lennox, hadn't we?"</p>
<p>The doctor appeared at the entrance to the tent.</p>
<p>"Come in, O'Grady, come in.  Late as
usual; there is no creature so wicked and
so dense as you."</p>
<p>The lunch was very like those of the good
old times—for there were already good old
times in this War, which was no longer
in the flower of its youth—the orderlies
handed boiled potatoes and mutton with
mint sauce, and Aurelle had a friendly
little discussion with the doctor.</p>
<p>"When do you think war will be finished,
Aurelle?" said the doctor.</p>
<p>"When we win," cut in the general.</p>
<p>But the doctor meant the League of
Nations: he did not believe in a final war.</p>
<p>"It is a fairly consistent law of humanity,"
he said, "that men spend about half their
lives at war.  A Frenchman, called Lapouge,
calculated that from the year 1100 to the
year 1500, England had been 207 years at
war, and 212 years from 1500 to 1900.  In
France the corresponding figures would be
192 and 181 years."</p>
<p>"That is very interesting," said the general.</p>
<p>"According to that same man Lapouge,
nineteen million men are killed in war every
century.  Their blood would fill three
million barrels of 180 litres each, and would
feed a fountain of blood running 700 litres
an hour from the beginning of history."</p>
<p>"Ugh!" said the general.</p>
<p>"All that does not prove, doctor," said
Aurelle, "that your fountain will go on
running.  For many centuries murder has
been an institution, and nevertheless courts
of justice have been established."</p>
<p>"Murder," said the doctor, "never appears
to have been an honoured institution
among primitive peoples.  Cain had no
reason to care for the justice of his country,
if I mistake not.  Besides, law courts have
not suppressed murderers.  They punish
them, which is not the same thing.  A
certain number of international conflicts
might be settled by civil tribunals, but
there will always be wars of passion."</p>
<p>"Have you read 'The Great Illusion'?"
said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"Yes," said the major, "it's a misleading
book.  It pretends to show that war is
useless, because it is not profitable.  We
know that very well, but who fights for
profit?  England did not take part in this
war to conquer, but to defend her honour.
As for believing that Democracies would
be pacific, that's nonsense.  A nation worthy
of the name is even more susceptible than
a monarch.  The Royal Era was the age
of gold, preceding the Iron Age of the
people."</p>
<p>"There's an argument just like the old
days," said the general.  "Both are right,
both are wrong.  That's capital!  Now,
doctor, tell me the story about your
going on leave and I shall be perfectly
happy."</p>
<p>After lunch, they all four went to see the
padre's grave.  It was in a little cemetery
surrounded by weeds; the ground broken
up here and there by recent shell-holes.
The padre lay between two lieutenants of
twenty.  Cornflowers and other wild plants
had spread a living mantle over all three
graves.</p>
<p>"After the war," said General Bramble,
"if I am still alive, I shall have a stone
carved with 'Here lies a soldier and a
sportsman.'  That will please him."</p>
<p>The other three remained silent, restraining
their emotion with difficulty.  Aurelle
seemed to hear, in the murmuring summer
air, the undying strains of "Destiny Waltz"
and saw the padre setting out once more
on horseback, his pockets bulging with
hymn-books and cigarettes for the men.
The doctor meditated: "'Where two or
three are gathered together, there I will be
in the midst of them.'  What a profound
and true saying!  And how the religion of
the dead still lives."</p>
<p>"Come," said the general, "we must go,
the Boche sausage is up in the air, and we
are four; it is too many.  They tolerate
two, but we must not abuse their courtesy.
I am going on up to the trenches.  You,
Parker, will take Aurelle back, and if you
want to go with them, doctor, I will tell
your colonel that I have given you leave
for the afternoon."</p>
<p>The three friends passed slowly across the
silent plains, which only a few months
before had been the formidable battlefield
of the Somme.  As far as the eye could
see, there were low, undulating hillocks
covered with thick, coarse grass, groups of
mutilated tree-trunks marking the place of
the famous wood, and millions of poppies
made these dead fields glow with a warm
and coppery light.  A few tenacious rose-trees,
with lovely fading roses, had remained
alive in this wilderness, beneath which slept
the dead.  Here and there posts, bearing
painted notices, like those on a station
platform, recalled villages unknown yesterday,
but now ranking with those of Marathon
or Kivoli: Contalmaison, Martinpuich,
Thiepval.</p>
<p>"I hope," said Aurelle, looking at the
innumerable little crosses, here grouped
together as in cemeteries, there isolated,
"that this ground will be consecrated to
the dead who won it, and that this country
will be kept as an immense rustic cemetery,
where children may come to learn the story
of heroes."</p>
<p>"What an idea!" said the doctor.  "No
doubt the graves will be respected; but
they will have good crops all round them
in two years' time.  The land is too rich
to remain widowed; look at that superb lot
of cornflowers on those half-healed scars."</p>
<p>And truly, a little further on, some of
the villages seemed, like convalescents, to
be tasting the joy of life once more.
Shop windows crowded with English goods
in many-coloured packets brightened up
the ruined houses.  As they passed through
a straggling village of Spanish aspect the
doctor resumed:</p>
<p>"Yes, this is a marvellous land.  Every
nation in Europe has conquered it in turn;
it has defeated its conqueror every time."</p>
<p>"If we go a little out of the way," said
Parker, "we could visit the battlefield
of Crécy; it would interest me.  I hope
you are not annoyed with us, Aurelle,
for having beaten Philippe de Valois?
Your military history is too glorious for
you to have any resentment for events
which took place so long ago."</p>
<p>"My oldest resentments do not last six
hundred years," said Aurelle.  "Crécy was
an honourably-contested match; we can
shake hands over it."</p>
<p>The chauffeur was told to turn to the
west, and they arrived on the site of Crécy
by the same lower road taken by Philippe's
army.</p>
<p>"The English," said Parker, "were
drawn up on the hill facing us, their right
towards Crécy, their left at Vadicourt,
that little village you see down there.
They were about thirty thousand; there
were a hundred thousand French.  The
latter appeared about three o'clock in the
afternoon, and immediately there was a
violent thunderstorm."</p>
<p>"I observe," said the doctor, "that the
heavens thought it funny to water an
offensive even in those days."</p>
<p>Parker explained the disposition of the
two armies, and the varying fortunes of
the battle.  Aurelle, who was not listening,
admired the woods, the quiet villages,
the yellowing grass of the fields, and saw
in imagination swarms of men and horses
riding up to the assault of this peaceful hill.</p>
<p>"Finally," concluded the major, "when
the King of France and his army had left the
field of battle, Edward invited the principal
corps commanders to dinner, and they all
ate and drank with great rejoicings because
of the good luck which had befallen them."</p>
<p>"How very English, that invitation to
dine with the King," said Aurelle.</p>
<p>"Then," continued Parker, "he ordered
one Renaud de Ghehoben to take all the
knights and clerks who knew heraldry——"</p>
<p>"The units," said the doctor, "ought to
send up this evening to His Majesty's
H.Q. a statement of all barons with armorial
bearings."</p>
<p>"And commanded them to count the
dead, and to write down the names of all
the knights whom they could recognize."</p>
<p>"The adjutant-general will start a
numbered list of lords who have been killed,
including their rank," said the doctor.</p>
<p>"Renaud found eleven princes, thirteen
hundred knights and sixteen thousand
foot soldiers."</p>
<p>Heavy black clouds were showing up
against the brilliant sunshine: a storm was
coming over the hill.  By the valley of
Renaud's clerks, they climbed up on to the
summit and Parker looked for the tower
from which Edward had watched the battle.</p>
<p>"I thought," he said, "that it had been
made into a mill, but I don't see one
on the horizon."</p>
<p>Aurelle, noticing a few old peasants,
helped by children, cutting corn in the
next field, went up to them and asked them
where the tower was.</p>
<p>"The tower?  There is no tower in
these parts," one of them said, "nor
mill either."</p>
<p>"Perhaps we are wrong," said the
major.  "Ask him if this is really where
the battle was."</p>
<p>"The battle?" replied the old man.
"What battle?"</p>
<p>And the people of Crécy turned back
to their work, binding into neat sheaves
the corn of this invincible land.</p>

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
