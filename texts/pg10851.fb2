<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO DOROTHY WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. January 8, 1821.]</p>
<p>Mary perfectly approves of the appropriat'n of the <emphasis>feathers</emphasis>, and
wishes them Peacocks for your fair niece's sake!</p>
<p>Dear Miss Wordsworth, I had just written the above endearing words when
Monkhouse tapped me on the shoulder with an invitation to cold goose
pye, which I was not Bird of that sort enough to decline. Mrs. M. I am
most happy to say is better. Mary has been tormented with a Rheumatism,
which is leaving her. I am suffering from the festivities of the season.
I wonder how my misused carcase holds it out. I have play'd the
experimental philosopher on it, that's certain. Willy shall be welcome
to a mince pye, and a bout at Commerce, whenever he comes. He was in our
eye. I am glad you liked my new year's speculations. Everybody likes
them, except the Author of the Pleasures of Hope. Disappointment attend
him! How I like to be liked, and <emphasis>what I do</emphasis> to be liked! They flatter
me in magazines, newspapers, and all the minor reviews. The Quarterlies
hold aloof. But they must come into it in time, or their leaves be waste
paper. Salute Trinity Library in my name. Two special things are worth
seeing at Cambridge, a portrait of Cromwell at Sidney, and a better of
Dr. Harvey (who found out that blood was red) at Dr. Davy's. You should
see them.</p>
<p>Coleridge is pretty well, I have not seen him, but hear often of him
from Alsop, who sends me hares and pheasants twice a week. I can hardly
take so fast as he gives. I have almost forgotten Butcher's meat, as
Plebeian. Are you not glad the Cold is gone? I find winters not so
agreeable as they used to be, when "winter bleak had charms for me." I
cannot conjure up a kind similitude for those snowy flakes—Let them
keep to Twelfth Cakes.</p>
<p>Mrs. Paris, our Cambridge friend, has been in Town. You do not know the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Watfords? in Trumpington Street—they are capital people.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Ask any body you meet, who is the biggest woman in Cambridge—and I'll
hold you a wager they'll say Mrs. Smith.</p>
<p>She broke down two benches in Trinity Gardens, one on the confines of
St. John's, which occasioned a litigation between the societies as to
repairing it. In warm weather she retires into an ice-cellar
(literally!) and dates the returns of the years from a hot Thursday some
20 years back. She sits in a room with opposite doors and windows, to
let in a thorough draught, which gives her slenderer friends
tooth-aches. She is to be seen in the market every morning at 10,
cheapening fowls, which I observe the Cambridge Poulterers are not
sufficiently careful to stump.</p>
<p>Having now answered most of the points containd in your Letter, let me
end with assuring you of our very best kindness, and excuse Mary from
not handling the Pen on this occasion, especially as it has fallen into
so much better hands! Will Dr. W. accept of my respects at the end of a
foolish Letter.</p>

<p>Lamb's New Year speculations were contained in his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "New

evidence that Campbell disapproved of the essay. Canon Ainger suggests
that Lamb may have thus alluded playfully to the pessimism of his
remarks, so opposed to the pleasures of hope. When the <emphasis>Quarterly</emphasis> did

<p>Dear Madam, Carriages to Cambridge are in such request, owing to the
Installation, that we have found it impossible to procure a conveyance
for Emma before Wednesday, on which day between the hours of 3 and 4 in
the afternoon you will see your little friend, with her bloom somewhat
impaired by late hours and dissipation, but her gait, gesture, and
general manners (I flatter myself) considerably improved by—<emphasis>somebody
that shall be nameless</emphasis>. My sister joins me in love to all true
Trumpingtonians, not specifying any, to avoid envy; and begs me to
assure you that Emma has been a very good girl, which, with certain
limitations, I must myself subscribe to. I wish I could cure her of
making dog's ears in books, and pinching them on poor Pompey, who, for
one, I dare say, will heartily rejoyce at her departure.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>[Mrs. Mathews (who was half-sister of Fanny Kelly) described this
evening in her <emphasis>Memoirs</emphasis> of her husband, 1839. Her account of Lamb is
interesting:—</p>
<p>    Mr. Lamb's first approach was not prepossessing. His figure was
    small and mean; and no man certainly was ever less beholden to his
    tailor. His "bran" new <emphasis>suit</emphasis> of black cloth (in which he affected
    several times during the day to take great pride, and to cherish as
    a novelty that he had long looked for and wanted) was drolly
    contrasted with his very rusty silk stockings, shown from his knees,
    and his much too large <emphasis>thick</emphasis> shoes, without polish. His shirt
    rejoiced in a wide ill-plaited frill, and his very small, tight,
    white neckcloth was hemmed to a fine point at the ends that formed
    part of the little bow. His hair was black and sleek, but not
    formal, and his face the gravest I ever saw, but indicating great
    intellect, and resembling very much the portraits of King Charles I.
    Mr. Coleridge was very anxious about his <emphasis>pet</emphasis> Lamb's first
    impression upon my husband, which I believe his friend saw; and
    guessing that he had been extolled, he mischievously resolved to
    thwart his panegyrist, disappoint the strangers, and altogether to
    upset the suspected plan of showing him off.</p>
<p>The Mathews' were then living at Ivy Cottage, only a short distance from
the Grove, Highgate, where the famous Mathews collection of pictures was
to be seen of which Lamb subsequently wrote in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Here should come a note to Ayrton saying that Madame Noblet is the least
graceful dancer that Lamb ever "did not see."]</p>

<p>LETTER 274</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN PAYNE COLLIER</strong></p>
<p>May 16, 1821.</p>
<p>Dear J.P.C.,—Many thanks for the "Decameron:" I have not such a
gentleman's book in my collection: it was a great treat to me, and I got
it just as I was wanting something of the sort. I take less pleasure in
books than heretofore, but I like books about books. In the second
volume, in particular, are treasures—your discoveries about "Twelfth
Night," etc. What a Shakespearian essence that speech of Osrades for
food!—Shakespeare is coarse to it—beginning "Forbear and eat no more."
Osrades warms up to that, but does not set out ruffian-swaggerer. The
character of the Ass with those three lines, worthy to be set in gilt
vellum, and worn in frontlets by the noble beasts for ever—</p>
<p>        "Thou would, perhaps, he should become thy foe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And to that end dost beat him many times:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He cares not for himself, much less thy blow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Cervantes, Sterne, and Coleridge, have said positively nothing for asses
compared with this.</p>
<p>I write in haste; but p. 24, vol. i., the line you cannot appropriate is
Gray's sonnet, specimenifyed by Wordsworth in first preface to L.B., as
mixed of bad and good style: p. 143, 2nd vol., you will find last poem
but one of the collection on Sidney's death in Spenser, the line,</p>
<p>        "Scipio, Caesar, Petrarch of our time."</p>
<p>This fixes it to be Raleigh's: I had guess'd it to be Daniel's. The last
after it, "Silence augmenteth rage," I will be crucified if it be not
Lord Brooke's. Hang you, and all meddling researchers, hereafter, that
by raking into learned dust may find me out wrong in my conjecture!</p>
<p>Dear J.P.C., I shall take the first opportunity of personally thanking
you for my entertainment. We are at Dalston for the most part, but I
fully hope for an evening soon with you in Russell or Bouverie Street,
to talk over old times and books. Remember <emphasis>us</emphasis> kindly to Mrs. J.P.C.
Yours very kindly, CHARLES LAMB. I write in misery.</p>
<p>N.B.—The best pen I could borrow at our butcher's: the ink, I verily
believe, came out of the kennel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Collier's <emphasis>Poetical Decameron</emphasis>, in two volumes, was published in 1820:
a series of imaginary conversations on curious and little-known books.
His "Twelfth Night" discoveries will be found in the Eighth
Conversation; Collier deduces the play from Barnaby Rich's <emphasis>Farewell to
Military Profession</emphasis>, 1606. He also describes Thomas Lodge's
"Rosalynde," the forerunner of "As You Like It," in which is the
character Rosader, whom Lamb calls Osrades. His speech for food runs
thus:—</p>
<p>    It hapned that day that <emphasis>Gerismond</emphasis>, the lawfull king of <emphasis>France</emphasis>
    banished by <emphasis>Torismond</emphasis>, who with a lustie crew of outlawes liued in
    that Forrest, that day in honour of his birth, made a feast to all
    his bolde yeomen, and frolickt it with store of wine and venison,
    sitting all at a long table vnder the shadow of Limon trees: to that
    place by chance fortune conducted Rosader, who seeing such a crew of
    braue men, hauing store of that for want of which hee and Adam
    perished, hee slept boldly to the boords end, and saluted the
    Company thus.—Whatsoeuer thou be that art maister of these lustie
    squires, I salute thee as graciously as a man in extreame distresse
    may: knowe that I and a fellow friend of mine, are here famished in
    the forrest for want of foode: perish we must, vnlesse relieued by
    thy fauours. Therefore if thou be a Gentleman, giue meate to men,
    and such as are euery way worthie of life: let the proudest Squire
    that sits at thy table rise and encounter with me in any honourable
    point of activitie whatsoeuer, and if he and thou proue me not a
    man, send mee away comfortlesse: if thou refuse this, as a niggard
    of thy cates, I will haue amongst you with my sword, for rather wil
    I die valiantly, then perish with so cowardly an extreame (Collier's
    <emphasis>Poetical Decameron</emphasis>, 174, Eighth Conversation).</p>
<p>Lamb compares with that the passage in "As You Like It," II., 7, 88,
beginning with Orlando's "Forbear, and eat no more." The character of
the ass is quoted by Collier from an old book, <emphasis>The Noblenesse of the
Asse</emphasis>, 1595, in the Third Conversation:—</p>
<p>        Thou wouldst (perhaps) he should become thy foe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And to that end doost beat him many times;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He cares not for himselfe, much lesse thy blowe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Lamb wrote more fully of this passage in an article on the ass
contributed to Hone's <emphasis>Every-Day Book</emphasis> in 1825 (see Vol. I. of the
present edition).</p>
<p>The line from Gray's sonnet on the death of Mr. Richard West was this:—</p>
<p>        And weep the more because I weep in vain.</p>
<p>"Scipio, Caesar," etc. This line runs, in the epitaph on Sidney,
beginning "To praise thy life"—</p>
<p>Scipio, Cicero, and Petrarch of our time!</p>
<p>It is generally supposed to be by Raleigh. The next poem, "Silence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Augmenteth Grief," is attributed by Malone to Sir Edward Dyer, and by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hannah to Raleigh.]</p>

<p>Thursday.</p>
<p>I am sorry the London Magazine is going to be given up.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[I assume the date of this note to be summer, 1821, because it was then
that Baldwin, Cradock &amp; Joy, the <emphasis>London Magazine's</emphasis> first publishers,
gave it up. The reason was the death of John Scott, the editor, and
probably to a large extent the originator, of the magazine. It was sold
to Taylor &amp; Hessey, their first number being dated July, 1821.</p>
<p>Scott had become involved in a quarrel with <emphasis>Blackwood</emphasis>, which reached
such a pitch that a duel was fought, between Scott and Christie, a
friend of Lockhart's. The whole story, which is involved, and indeed not
wholly clear, need not be told here: it will be found in Mr. Lang's
memoir of Lockhart. The meeting was held at Chalk Farm on February 16,
1821. Peter George Patmore, sub-editor of the <emphasis>London</emphasis>, was Scott's
second. Scott fell, wounded by a shot which Christie fired purely in
self-defence. He died on February 27.</p>
<p>Mr. Cary. Henry Francis Cary the translator of Dante and a contributor
to the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> had four periods. From 1820 to the middle of 1821,
when it was Baldwin, Cradock &amp; Joy's. From 1821 to the end of 1824, when
it was Taylor &amp; Hessey's at a shilling. From January, 1825, to August of
that year, when it was Taylor &amp; Hessey's at half-a-crown; and from
September, l825, to the end, when it was Henry Southern's, and was
published by Hunt &amp; Clarke.]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN TAYLOR</strong></p>
<p>Margate, June 8, 1821.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,—I am extremely sorry to be obliged to decline the article
proposed, as I should have been flattered with a Plate accompanying it.
In the first place, Midsummer day is not a topic I could make anything
of—I am so pure a Cockney, and little read, besides, in May games and
antiquities; and, in the second, I am here at Margate, spoiling my
holydays with a Review I have undertaken for a friend, which I shall
barely get through before my return; for that sort of work is a hard
task to me. If you will excuse the shortness of my first
contribution-and I <emphasis>know</emphasis> I can promise nothing more for July—I will
endeavour a longer article for <emphasis>our next</emphasis>. Will you permit me to say
that I think Leigh Hunt would do the article you propose in a masterly
manner, if he has not outwrit himself already upon the subject. I do not
return the proof—to save postage—because it is correct, with ONE
EXCEPTION. In the stanza from Wordsworth, you have changed DAY into AIR
for rhyme-sake: DAY is the right reading, and I IMPLORE you to restore
it.</p>
<p>The other passage, which you have queried, is to my ear correct. Pray
let it stand.</p>
<p>D'r S'r, yours truly,                                     C. LAMB.</p>
<p>On second consideration, I do enclose the proof.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[John Taylor (1781-1864), the publisher, with Hessey, of the <emphasis>London
Magazine</emphasis> was, in 1813, the first publicly to identify Sir Philip
Francis with Junius. Taylor acted as editor of the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>
from 1821 to 1824, assisted by Thomas Hood. Later his interests were
centred in currency questions.</p>
<p>"I am here at Margate." I do not know what review Lamb was writing. If
written and published it has not been reprinted. It was on this visit to
Margate that Lamb met Charles Cowden Clarke.</p>
<p>"My first contribution." The first number to bear Taylor &amp; Hessey's name
was dated July, but they had presumably acquired the rights in the
magazine before then. Lamb's first contribution to the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>
had been in August, 1820, "The South-Sea House."</p>
<p>The proof which Lamb returned was that of the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis>, essay on "Mackery</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

End in Hertfordshire," printed in the July number of the <emphasis>London</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO CHARLES ABRAHAM ELTON</strong></p>
<p>India House</p>
<p>to which place all letters addressed to C.L. commonly come.</p>
<p>[August 17, 1821 (?).]</p>
<p>My dear Sir, You have overwhelmed me with your favours. I have received
positively a little library from Baldwyn's. I do not know how I have
deserved such a bounty. We have been up to the ear in the classics ever
since it came. I have been greatly pleased, but most, I think, with the
Hesiod,—the Titan battle quite amazed me. Gad, it was no child's
play—and then the homely aphorisms at the end of the works—how
adroitly you have turned them! Can he be the same Hesiod who did the
Titans? the latter is—</p>
<p>            "——-wine
            Which to madness does incline."</p>
<p>But to read the Days and Works, is like eating nice brown bread, homely
sweet and nutritive. Apollonius was new to me. I had confounded him with
the conjuror of that name. Medea is glorious; but I cannot give up Dido.
She positively is the only Fine Lady of Antiquity: her courtesy to the
Trojans is altogether queen-like. Eneas is a most disagreeable person.
Ascanius a pretty young master. Mezentius for my money. His dying speech
shames Turpin—not the Archbishop I mean, but the roadster of that name.</p>
<p>I have been ashamed to find how many names of classics (and more than
their names) you have introduced me to, that before I was ignorant of.
Your commendation of Master Chapman arrideth me. Can any one read the
pert modern Frenchify'd notes, &amp;c., in Pope's translation, and contrast
them with solemn weighty prefaces of Chapman, writing in full faith, as
he evidently does, of the plenary inspiration of his author—worshipping
his meanest scraps and relics as divine—without one sceptical misgiving
of their authenticity, and doubt which was the properest to expound
Homer to their countrymen. Reverend Chapman! you have read his hymn to
Pan (the Homeric)—why, it is Milton's blank verse clothed with rhyme.
Paradise Lost could scarce lose, could it be so accoutred.</p>
<p>I shall die in the belief that he has improved upon Homer, in the
Odyssey in particular—the disclosure of Ulysses of himself, to
Alcinous, his previous behaviour at the song of the stern strife arising
between Achilles and himself (how it raises him above the <emphasis>Iliad</emphasis>
Ulysses!) but you know all these things quite as well as I do. But what
a deaf ear old C. would have turned to the doubters in Homer's real
personality! They might as well have denied the appearance of J.C. in
the flesh.—He apparently believed all the fables of H.'s birth, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Those notes of Bryant have caused the greatest disorder in my brain-pan.
Well, I will not flatter when I say that we have had two or three long
evening's <emphasis>good reading</emphasis> out of your kind present.</p>
<p>I will say nothing of the tenderest parts in your own little volume, at
the end of such a slatternly scribble as this, but indeed they cost us
some tears. I scrawl away because of interruptions every moment. You
guess how it is in a busy office—papers thrust into your hand when your
hand is busiest—and every anti-classical disavocation.</p>

<p>[Sir Charles Abraham Elton (1778-1853) seems to have sent Lamb a number
of his books, principally his <emphasis>Specimens of the Classical</emphasis> <emphasis>Poets …
from Homer to Tryphiodorus translated into English Verse</emphasis>, Baldwin,
1814, in three volumes. Lamb refers first to the passage from Hesiod's
<emphasis>Theogony</emphasis>, and then to his <emphasis>Works and Days</emphasis> (which Chapman
translated)—"Dispensation of Providence to the Just and Unjust."</p>
<p>Apollonius Rhodius was the author of <emphasis>The Argonautics</emphasis>. Lamb then passes
on to Virgil. For the death of Mezentius see the <emphasis>Aeneid</emphasis>, Book X., at
the end. The makers of broadsides had probably credited Dick Turpin with
a dying speech.</p>

<p>[Summer, 1821.]</p>
<p>My dear Sir—Your letter has lain in a drawer of my desk, upbraiding me
every time I open the said drawer, but it is almost impossible to answer
such a letter in such a place, and I am out of the habit of replying to
epistles otherwhere than at office. You express yourself concerning H.
like a true friend, and have made me feel that I have somehow neglected
him, but without knowing very well how to rectify it. I live so remote
from him—by Hackney—that he is almost out of the pale of visitation at
Hampstead. And I come but seldom to Cov't Gard'n this summer time—and
when I do, am sure to pay for the late hours and pleasant Novello
suppers which I incur. I also am an invalid. But I will hit upon some
way, that you shall not have cause for your reproof in future. But do
not think I take the hint unkindly. When I shall be brought low by any
sickness or untoward circumstance, write just such a letter to some
tardy friend of mine—or come up yourself with your friendly Henshaw
face—and that will be better. I shall not forget in haste our casual
day at Margate. May we have many such there or elsewhere! God bless you
for your kindness to H., which I will remember. But do not show N. this,
for the flouting infidel doth mock when Christians cry God bless us.

<p>MY dear friend,</p>
<p>The kind interest you took in my perplexities of yesterday makes me feel
that you will be well pleased to hear I got through my complicated
business far better than I had ventured to hope I should do. In the
first place let me thank you, my good friend, for your good advice; for,
had I not gone to Martin first he would have sent a senseless letter to
Mr. Rickman, and <emphasis>now</emphasis> he is coming here to-day in order to frame one in
conjunction with my brother.</p>
<p>What will be Mr. Rickman's final determination I know not, but he and
Mrs. Rickman both gave me a most kind reception, and a most patient
hearing, and then Mr. R. walked with me as far as Bishopsgate Street,
conversing the whole way on the same unhappy subject. I will see you
again the very first opportunity till when farewel with grateful thanks.</p>
<p>How senseless I was not to make you go back in that empty coach. I never
have but one idea in my poor head at a time.</p>

<p>My dear Sir, I have to thank you for a fine hare, and unless I am

with it was that it came from Mr. Alfourd—I have no friend of that

<p>so my gratitude must be divided between you, till I know the true

which does not improve hares by the circuitous route of Cov't Garden,
though for the sweetness of <emphasis>this last</emphasis> I will answer. We dress it
to-day. I suppose you know my sister has been &amp; is ill. I do not see
much hopes, though there is a glimmer, of her speedy recovery. When we
are all well, I hope to come among our town friends, and shall have

<p>[A further letter to Ayrton, dated from Dalston, October 30, is printed
by Mr. Macdonald, in which Lamb speaks of his sister's illness and the
death of his brother John, who died on October 26, aged fifty-eight. It
is reasonable to suppose that Lamb, when the above note was written, was
unaware of his brother's death (see note to Letter 284 on page 610). On
October 26, however, he had written to the editor of the <emphasis>London
Magazine</emphasis> saying that he was most uncomfortably situated at home and
expecting some trouble which might prevent further writing for some
time—which may have been an allusion to his brother's illness or to
signs of Mary Lamb's approaching malady.</p>
<p>Here should come a note to William Hone, evidently in reply to a comment
on Lamb's essay on "Saying Grace."</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Rickman, dated November 20, 1821,
referring to Admiral Burney's death. "I have been used to death lately.
Poor Jim White's departure last year first broke the spell. I had been
so fortunate as to have lost no friends in that way for many long years,
and began to think people did not die." He says that Mary Lamb has
recovered from a long illness and is pretty well resigned to John Lamb's
death.]</p>

<p>LETTER 283</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE</strong></p>
<p>March 9th, 1822.</p>
<p>Dear C.,—It gives me great satisfaction to hear that the pig turned out
so well—they are interesting creatures at a certain age—what a pity
such buds should blow out into the maturity of rank bacon! You had all
some of the crackling —and brain sauce—did you remember to rub it with
butter, and gently dredge it a little, just before the crisis? Did the
eyes come away kindly with no Oedipean avulsion? Was the crackling the
colour of the ripe pomegranate? Had you no complement of boiled neck of
mutton before it, to blunt the edge of delicate desire? Did you flesh
maiden teeth in it? Not that I sent the pig, or can form the remotest
guess what part Owen could play in the business. I never knew him give
anything away in my life. He would not begin with strangers. I suspect
the pig, after all, was meant for me; but at the unlucky juncture of
time being absent, the present somehow went round to Highgate. To
confess an honest truth, a pig is one of those things I could never
think of sending away. Teals, wigeons, snipes, barn-door fowl, ducks,
geese—your tame villatic things—Welsh mutton, collars of brawn,
sturgeon, fresh or pickled, your potted char, Swiss cheeses, French
pies, early grapes, muscadines, I impart as freely unto my friends as to
myself. They are but self-extended; but pardon me if I stop
somewhere—where the fine feeling of benevolence giveth a higher smack
than the sensual rarity—there my friends (or any good man) may command
me; but pigs are pigs, and I myself therein am nearest to myself. Nay, I
should think it an affront, an undervaluing done to Nature who bestowed
such a boon upon me, if in a churlish mood I parted with the precious
gift. One of the bitterest pangs of remorse I ever felt was when a
child—when my kind old aunt had strained her pocketstrings to bestow a
sixpenny whole plum-cake upon me. In my way home through the Borough, I
met a venerable old man, not a mendicant, but thereabouts—a
look-beggar, not a verbal petitionist; and in the coxcombry of
taught-charity I gave away the cake to him. I walked on a little in all
the pride of an Evangelical peacock, when of a sudden my old aunt's
kindness crossed me—the sum it was to her—the pleasure she had a right
to expect that I—not the old impostor —should take in eating her
cake—the cursed ingratitude by which, under the colour of a Christian
virtue, I had frustrated her cherished purpose. I sobbed, wept, and took
it to heart so grievously, that I think I never suffered the like—and I
was right. It was a piece of unfeeling hypocrisy, and proved a lesson to
me ever after. The cake has long been masticated, consigned to dunghill
with the ashes of that unseasonable pauper.</p>
<p>But when Providence, who is better to us all than our aunts, gives me a
pig, remembering my temptation and my fall, I shall endeavour to act
towards it more in the spirit of the donor's purpose.</p>
<p>Yours (short of pig) to command in everything.                 C.L.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[This letter probably led to the immediate composition of the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis>
essay "A Dissertation on Roast Pig" (see Vol. II. of the present
edition), which was printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for September,
1822. See also "Thoughts on Presents of Game," Vol. I. of this edition.</p>
<p>"Owen." Lamb's landlord in Russell Street.</p>
<p>"My kind old aunt… the Borough." This is rather perplexing. Lamb, to
the best of our knowledge, never as a child lived anywhere but in the
Temple. His only aunt of whom we know anything lived with the family
also in the Temple. But John Lamb's will proves Lamb to have had two
aunts. The reference to the Borough suggests therefore that the aunt in
question was not Sarah Lamb (Aunt Hetty) but her sister.]</p>

<p>LETTER 284</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>20th March, 1822.</p>
<p>My dear Wordsworth—A letter from you is very grateful, I have not seen
a Kendal postmark so long! We are pretty well save colds and rheumatics,
and a certain deadness to every thing, which I think I may date from
poor John's Loss, and another accident or two at the same time, that has
made me almost bury myself at Dalston, where yet I see more faces than I
could wish. Deaths over-set one and put one out long after the recent
grief. Two or three have died within this last two twelvem'ths, and so
many parts of me have been numbed. One sees a picture, reads an
anecdote, starts a casual fancy, and thinks to tell of it to this person
in preference to every other—the person is gone whom it would have
peculiarly suited. It won't do for <emphasis>another</emphasis>. Every departure destroys a
class of sympathies. There's Capt. Burney gone!—what fun has whist now?
what matters it what you lead, if you can no longer fancy him looking
over you? One never hears any thing, but the image of the particular
person occurs with whom alone almost you would care to share the
intelligence. Thus one distributes oneself about—and now for so many
parts of me I have lost the market. Common natures do not suffice me.
Good people, as they are called, won't serve. I want individuals. I am
made up of queer points and I want so many answering needles. The going
away of friends does not make the remainder more precious. It takes so
much from them as there was a common link. A. B. and C. make a party. A.
dies. B. not only loses A. but all A.'s part in C. C. loses A.'s part in
B., and so the alphabet sickens by subtraction of interchangeables. I
express myself muddily, capite dolente. I have a dulling cold. My theory
is to enjoy life, but the practice is against it. I grow ominously tired
of official confinement. Thirty years have I served the Philistines, and
my neck is not subdued to the yoke. You don't know how wearisome it is
to breathe the air of four pent walls without relief day after day, all
the golden hours of the day between 10 and 4 without ease or
interposition. Taedet me harum quotidianarum formarum, these
pestilential clerk faces always in one's dish. O for a few years between
the grave and the desk! they are the same, save that at the latter you
are outside the machine. The foul enchanter—letters four do form his
name—Busirane is his name in hell—that has curtailed you of some
domestic comforts, hath laid a heavier hand on me, not in present
infliction, but in taking away the hope of enfranchisement. I dare not
whisper to myself a Pension on this side of absolute incapacitation and
infirmity, till years have sucked me dry. Otium cum indignitate. I had
thought in a green old age (O green thought!) to have retired to
Ponder's End—emblematic name how beautiful! in the Ware road, there to
have made up my accounts with Heaven and the Company, toddling about
between it and Cheshunt, anon stretching on some fine Izaac Walton
morning to Hoddesdon or Amwell, careless as a Beggar, but walking,
walking ever, till I fairly walkd myself off my legs, dying walking!</p>
<p>The hope is gone. I sit like Philomel all day (but not singing) with my
breast against this thorn of a Desk, with the only hope that some
Pulmonary affliction may relieve me. Vide Lord Palmerston's report of
the Clerks in the war office (Debates, this morning's Times) by which it
appears in 20 years, as many Clerks have been coughd and catarrhd out of
it into their freer graves.</p>
<p>Thank you for asking about the Pictures. Milton hangs over my fire side
in Covt. Card, (when I am there), the rest have been sold for an old
song, wanting the eloquent tongue that should have set them off!</p>
<p>You have gratifyd me with liking my meeting with Dodd. For the Malvolio
story—the thing is become in verity a sad task and I eke it out with
any thing. If I could slip out of it I sh'd be happy, but our chief
reputed assistants have forsaken us. The opium eater crossed us once
with a dazzling path, and hath as suddenly left us darkling; and in
short I shall go on from dull to worse, because I cannot resist the
Bookseller's importunity—the old plea you know of authors, but I
believe on my part sincere.</p>
<p>Hartley I do not so often see, but I never see him in unwelcome hour. I
thoroughly love and honor him.</p>
<p>I send you a frozen Epistle, but it is winter and dead time of the year
with me. May heaven keep something like spring and summer up with you,
strengthen your eyes and make mine a little lighter to encounter with
them, as I hope they shall yet and again, before all are closed.</p>

remark about Coleridge, "God bless him—to use a vulgar expression," as
recorded by Coleridge in one of his letters. Lamb also said of Godwin
(and to him) that he had read more books that were not worth reading

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO W. HARRISON AINSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: May 7, 1822.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir,—I have read your poetry with pleasure. The tales are pretty
and prettily told, the language often finely poetical. It is only
sometimes a little careless, I mean as to redundancy. I have marked
certain passages (in pencil only, which will easily obliterate) for your
consideration. Excuse this liberty. For the distinction you offer me of
a dedication, I feel the honor of it, but I do not think it would
advantage the publication. I am hardly on an eminence enough to warrant
it. The Reviewers, who are no friends of mine—the two big ones
especially who make a point of taking no notice of anything I bring
out—may take occasion by it to decry us both. But I leave you to your
own judgment. Perhaps, if you wish to give me a kind word, it will be
more appropriate <emphasis>before your republication of Tourneur</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The "Specimens" would give a handle to it, which the poems might seem to
want. But I submit it to yourself with the old recollection that
"beggars should not be chusers" and remain with great respect and

<p>[Owing largely to a flaw in the title-deed of his house at 41 Skinner
Street, which he had to forfeit, Godwin had come upon poverty greater
than any he had previously suffered, although he had been always more or
less necessitous. Lamb now lent him £50. In the following year, after
being mainly instrumental in putting on foot a fund for Godwin's
benefit, he transformed this loan into a gift. An appeal was issued in
1823 asking for; £600, the following postscript to which, in Lamb's
hand, is preserved at the South Kensington Museum:—</p>
<p>"There are few circumstances belonging to the case which are not
sufficiently adverted to in the above letter.</p>
<p>"Mr. Godwin's opponent declares himself determined to act against him
with the last degree of hostility: the law gives him the power the first
week in November to seize upon Mr. Godwin's property, furniture, books,
&amp;c. together with all his present sources of income for the support of
himself and his family. Mr. Godwin has at this time made considerable
progress in a work of great research, and requiring all the powers of
his mind, to the completion of which he had lookd for future pecuniary
advantage. His mind is at this moment so entirely occupied in this work,
that he feels within himself the firmness and resolution that no
<emphasis>prospect</emphasis> of evil or calamity shall draw him off from it or suspend his
labours. But the <emphasis>calamity itself</emphasis>, if permitted to arrive, will produce
the physical impossibility for him to proceed. His books and the
materials of his work, as well as his present sources of income, will be
taken from him. Those materials have been the collection of several
years, and it would require a long time to replace them, if they could
ever be replaced.</p>
<p>"The favour of an early answer is particularly requested, that the
extent of the funds supplied may as soon as possible be ascertained,
particularly as any aid, however kindly intended, will, after the lapse
of a very few weeks, become useless to the purpose in view."</p>

<p>LETTER 287</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. JOHN LAMB</strong></p>
<p>22 May 1822.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Lamb, A letter has come to Arnold for Mrs. Phillips, and, as I
have not her address, I take this method of sending it to you. That old
rogue's name is Sherwood, as you guessed, but as I named the shirts to
him, I think he must have them. Your character of him made me almost
repent of the bounty.</p>
<p>You must consider this letter as Mary's—for writing letters is such a
trouble and puts her to such twitters (family modesty, you know; it is
the way with me, but I try to get over it) that in pity I offer to do it
for her.—</p>
<p>We hold our intention of seeing France, but expect to see you here
first, as we do not go till the 20th of next month. A steam boat goes to
Dieppe, I see.—</p>
<p>Christie has not sent to me, and I suppose is in no hurry to settle the
account. I think in a day or two (if I do not hear from you to the
contrary) I shall refresh his memory.</p>
<p>I am sorry I made you pay for two Letters. I Peated it, and re-peated
it.</p>
<p>Miss Wright is married, and I am a hamper in her debt, which I hope will
now not be remembered. She is in great good humour, I hear, and yet out
of spirits.</p>
<p>Where shall I get such full flavor'd Geneva again?</p>
<p>Old Mr. Henshaw died last night precisely at 1/2 past 11.—He has been
open'd by desire of Mrs. McKenna; and, where his heart should have been,
was found a stone. Poor Arnold is inconsolable; and, not having shaved
since, looks deplorable.</p>
<p>With our kind remembrances to Caroline and your friends</p>
<p>We remain yours affectionaly                         C.L. AND M. LAMB.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Occupying the entire margin up the left-hand side of the letter is, in
Mary Lamb's hand</emphasis>:—]</p>
<p>I thank you for your kind letter, and owe you one in return, but Charles
is in such a hurry to send this to be franked.</p>
<p>Your affectionate sister</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>M. LAMB.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[<emphasis>On the right-hand margin, beside the paragraph about Mr. Henshaw, is
written in the same hand, underlined</emphasis>:—]</p>
<p>He is not dead.</p>
<p>[John Lamb's widow had been a Mrs. Dowden, with an unmarried daughter,
probably the Caroline referred to. The letter treats of family matters
which could not now be explained even if it were worth while. The Lambs
were arranging a visit to Versailles, to the Kenneys. Mr. Henshaw was
Lamb's godfather, a gunsmith.]</p>

<p>LETTER 288</p>

<p>CHARLES LAMB TO MARY LAMB (in Paris).</p>
<p>[August, 1822.]</p>
<p>Then you must walk all along the Borough side of the Seine facing the
Tuileries. There is a mile and a half of print shops and book stalls. If
the latter were but English. Then there is a place where the Paris
people put all their dead people and bring em flowers and dolls and
ginger bread nuts and sonnets and such trifles. And that is all I think
worth seeing as sights, except that the streets and shops of Paris are
themselves the best sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[The Lambs had left England for France in June. While they were there
Mary Lamb was taken ill again—in a diligence, according to Moore—and
Lamb had to return home alone, leaving a letter, of which this is the
only portion that has been preserved, for her guidance on her recovery.
It is also the only writing from Lamb to his sister that exists. Mary
Lamb, who had taken her nurse with her in case of trouble, was soon well
again, and in August had the company of Crabb Robinson in Paris. Mrs.
Aders was also there, and Foss, the bookseller in Pall Mall, and his
brother. And it was on this visit that the Lambs met John Howard Payne,
whom we shall shortly see.]</p>

<p>LETTER 289</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN CLARE</strong></p>
<p>India House, 31 Aug., 1822.</p>
<p>Dear Clare—I thank you heartily for your present. I am an inveterate
old Londoner, but while I am among your choice collections, I seem to be
native to them, and free of the country. The quantity of your
observation has astonished me. What have most pleased me have been
Recollections after a Ramble, and those Grongar Hill kind of pieces in
eight syllable lines, my favourite measure, such as Cowper Hill and
Solitude. In some of your story-telling Ballads the provincial phrases
sometimes startle me. I think you are too profuse with them. In poetry
<emphasis>slang</emphasis> of every kind is to be avoided. There is a rustick Cockneyism,
as little pleasing as ours of London. Transplant Arcadia to Helpstone.
The true rustic style, the Arcadian English, I think is to be found in
Shenstone. Would his Schoolmistress, the prettiest of poems, have been
better, if he had used quite the Goody's own language? Now and then a
home rusticism is fresh and startling, but where nothing is gained in
expression, it is out of tenor. It may make folks smile and stare, but
the ungenial coalition of barbarous with refined phrases will prevent
you in the end from being so generally tasted, as you deserve to be.
Excuse my freedom, and take the same liberty with my <emphasis>puns</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I send you two little volumes of my spare hours. They are of all sorts,
there is a methodist hymn for Sundays, and a farce for Saturday night.
Pray give them a place on your shelf. Pray accept a little volume, of
which I have [a] duplicate, that I may return in equal number to your
welcome presents.</p>
<p>I think I am indebted to you for a sonnet in the London for August.</p>
<p>Since I saw you I have been in France, and have eaten frogs. The nicest
little rabbity things you ever tasted. Do look about for them. Make Mrs.
Clare pick off the hind quarters, boil them plain, with parsley and
butter. The fore quarters are not so good. She may let them hop off by
themselves.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHAS. LAMB.</strong></p>

<p>[John Clare (1793-1864) was the Northamptonshire poet whom the <emphasis>London
Magazine</emphasis> had introduced to fame. Octavius Gilchrist had played to him
the same part that Capell Lofft had to Bloomfield. His first volume,
<emphasis>Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery</emphasis>, was published in January,
1820; his next, <emphasis>The Village Minstrel</emphasis>, in September of the next year.
These he had probably sent to Lamb. Helpstone was Clare's birthplace.
Lamb's two little return volumes were his <emphasis>Works</emphasis>. The sonnet in the
August <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> was not signed by Clare. It runs thus:—</p>
<p>        TO ELlA</p>
<p>        ELIA, thy reveries and vision'd themes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To Care's lorn heart a luscious pleasure prove;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wild as the mystery of delightful dreams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Soft as the anguish of remember'd love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Like records of past days their memory dances</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Mid the cool feelings Manhood's reason brings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As the unearthly visions of romances</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Peopled with sweet and uncreated things;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And yet thy themes thy gentle worth enhances!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Then wake again thy wild harp's tenderest strings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Sing on, sweet Bard, let fairy loves again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Smile in thy dreams, with angel ecstacies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Bright o'er our souls will break the heavenly strain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Through the dull gloom of earth's realities.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Clare addressed to Lamb a sonnet on his <emphasis>Dramatic Specimens</emphasis> which was
printed in Hone's <emphasis>Year Book</emphasis> in 1831.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Ayrton dated Sept. 5, 1822,
referring to the writer's "drunken caput" and loss of memory.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Mrs. James Kenney, dated Sept.
11, 1822, in which Lamb says that Mary Lamb had reached home safely from
France, and that she failed to smuggle Crabb Robinson's waistcoat. He
adds that the Custom House people could not comprehend how a waistcoat,
marked Henry Robinson, could be a part of Miss Lamb's wearing apparel.
At the end of the letter is a charming note to Mrs. Kenney's little
girl, Sophy, whom Lamb calls his dear wife. He assures her that the few
short days of connubial felicity which he passed with her among the
pears and apricots of Versailles were some of the happiest of his life.]</p>

<p>LETTER 290</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>India House, 11 Sept. 1822.</p>
<p>Dear Sir—You have misapprehended me sadly, if you suppose that I meant
to impute any inconsistency (in your writing poetry) with your religious
profession. I do not remember what I said, but it was spoken sportively,
I am sure. One of my levities, which you are not so used to as my older
friends. I probably was thinking of the light in which your so indulging
yourself would appear to <emphasis>Quakers</emphasis>, and put their objection in my own
foolish mouth. I would eat my words (provided they should be written on
not very coarse paper) rather than I would throw cold water upon your,
and my once, harmless occupation. I have read Napoleon and the rest with
delight. I like them for what they are, and for what they are not. I
have sickened on the modern rhodomontade &amp; Byronism, and your plain
Quakerish Beauty has captivated me. It is all wholesome cates, aye, and
toothsome too, and withal Quakerish. If I were George Fox, and George
Fox Licenser of the Press, they should have my absolute IMPRIMATUR. I
hope I have removed the impression.</p>
<p>I am, like you, a prisoner to the desk. I have been chained to that
gally thirty years, a long shot. I have almost grown to the wood. If no
imaginative poet, I am sure I am a figurative one. Do "Friends" allow
puns? <emphasis>verbal</emphasis> equivocations?—they are unjustly accused of it, and I
did my little best in the "imperfect Sympathies" to vindicate them.</p>
<p>I am very tired of clerking it, but have no remedy. Did you see a sonnet
to this purpose in the Examiner?—</p>
<p>        "Who first invented Work—and tied the free</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And holy-day rejoycing spirit down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To the ever-haunting importunity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of business, in the green fields, and the town—</p>

        To plough—loom—anvil—spade—&amp;, oh, most sad,</p>

<p><strong>C.L.</strong></p>
<p>I fancy the sentiment exprest above will be nearly your own, the
expression of it probably would not so well suit with a follower of John
Woolman. But I do not know whether diabolism is a part of your creed, or
where indeed to find an exposition of your creed at all. In feelings and
matters not dogmatical, I hope I am half a Quaker. Believe me, with
great respect, yours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>I shall always be happy to see, or hear from you.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[This is the first of the letters to Bernard Barton (1784-1849), a clerk
in a bank at Woodbridge, in Suffolk, who was known as the Quaker poet.
Lamb had met him at a <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> dinner at 13 Waterloo Place, and
had apparently said something about Quakers and poetry which Barton, on
thinking it over, had taken too seriously. Bernard Barton was already
the author of four volumes of poetry, of which <emphasis>Napoleon and other
Poems</emphasis> was the latest, published in 1822. Lamb's essay on "Imperfect
Sympathies" had been printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for August, 1821.
For John Woolman, see note on page 93. The sonnet "Work" had been
printed in the <emphasis>Examiner</emphasis>, August 29, 1819.]</p>

<p>LETTER 291</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BARRON FIELD</strong></p>
<p>Sept. 22, 1822.</p>
<p>My dear F.,—I scribble hastily at office. Frank wants my letter
presently. I &amp; sister are just returned from Paris!! We have eaten
frogs. It has been such a treat! You know our monotonous general Tenor.
Frogs are the nicest little delicate things—rabbity-flavoured. Imagine
a Lilliputian rabbit! They fricassee them; but in my mind, drest
seethed, plain, with parsley and butter, would have been the decision of
Apicius. Shelley the great Atheist has gone down by water to eternal
fire! Hunt and his young fry are left stranded at Pisa, to be adopted by
the remaining duumvir, Lord Byron—his wife and 6 children &amp; their maid.
What a cargo of Jonases, if they had foundered too! The only use I can
find of friends, is that they do to borrow money of you. Henceforth I
will consort with none but rich rogues. Paris is a glorious picturesque
old City. London looks mean and New to it, as the town of Washington
would, seen after <emphasis>it</emphasis>. But they have no St. Paul's or Westminster
Abbey. The Seine, so much despised by Cockneys, is exactly the size to
run thro' a magnificent street; palaces a mile long on one side, lofty
Edinbro' stone (O the glorious antiques!): houses on the other. The
Thames disunites London &amp; Southwark. I had Talma to supper with me. He
has picked up, as I believe, an authentic portrait of Shakspere. He paid
a broker about £40 English for it. It is painted on the one half of a
pair of bellows—a lovely picture, corresponding with the Folio head.
The bellows has old carved wings round it, and round the visnomy is
inscribed, near as I remember, not divided into rhyme—I found out the
rhyme—</p>
<p>            "Whom have we here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Stuck on this bellows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            But the Prince of good fellows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Willy Shakspere?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                    At top—</p>
<p>      "O base and coward luck!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To be here stuck.—POINS."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                   At bottom—</p>
<p>      "Nay! rather a glorious lot is to him assign'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Who, like the Almighty, rides upon the wind.—PISTOL."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This is all in old carved wooden letters. The countenance smiling,
sweet, and intellectual beyond measure, even as He was immeasurable. It
may be a forgery. They laugh at me and tell me Ireland is in Paris, and
has been putting off a portrait of the Black Prince. How far old wood
may be imitated I cannot say. Ireland was not found out by his
parchments, but by his poetry. I am confident no painter on either side
the Channel could have painted any thing near like the face I saw.
Again, would such a painter and forger have expected £40 for a thing, if
authentic, worth £4000? Talma is not in the secret, for he had not even
found out the rhymes in the first inscription. He is coming over with
it, and, my life to Southey's Thalaba, it will gain universal faith.</p>
<p>The letter is wanted, and I am wanted. Imagine the blank filled up with
all kind things.</p>
<p>Our joint hearty remembrances to both of you. Yours as ever,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Frank was Francis John Field, Barron Field's brother, in the India</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

House.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Shelley was drowned on July 8, 1822.</p>
<p>Talma was François Joseph Talma (1763-1826), the great French tragedian.
Lamb, introduced by John Howard Payne, saw him in "Regulus," but not
understanding French was but mildly interested. "Ah," said Talma in the
account by James Kenney printed in Henry Angelo's <emphasis>Pic Nic</emphasis>, "I was not
very happy to-night; you must see me in 'Scylla.'" "Incidit in Scyllam,"
said Lamb, "qui vult vitare Charybdiro." "Ah, you are a rogue; you are a
great rogue," was Talma's reply. Talma had bought a pair of bellows with
Shakespeare's head on it. Lamb's belief in the authenticity of this
portrait was misplaced, as the following account from <emphasis>Chambers'
Journal</emphasis> for September 27, 1856, will show:—</p>
<p>About the latter part of the last century, one Zincke, an artist of
little note, but grandson of the celebrated enameller of that name,
manufactured fictitious Shakespeares by the score…. The most famous of
Zincke's productions is the well-known Talma Shakespeare, which gentle
Charles Lamb made a pilgrimage to Paris to see; and when he did see,
knelt down and kissed with idolatrous veneration. Zincke painted it on a
larger panel than was necessary for the size of the picture, and then
cut away the superfluous wood, so as to leave the remainder in the shape
of a pair of bellows…. Zincke probably was thinking of "a muse of
fire" when he adopted this strange method of raising the wind; but he
made little by it, for the dealer into whose hands the picture passed,
sold it as a curiosity, not an original portrait, for £5. The buyer,
being a person of ingenuity, and fonder of money than curiosities,
fabricated a series of letters to and from Sir Kenelm Digby, and,
passing over to France, <emphasis>planted</emphasis>—the slang term used among the less
honest of the curiosity-dealing fraternity—the picture and the letters
in an old château near Paris. Of course a confederate managed to
discover the <emphasis>plant</emphasis>, in the presence of witnesses, and great was the
excitement that ensued. Sir Kenelm Digby had been in France in the reign
of Charles I., and the fictitious correspondence <emphasis>proved</emphasis> that the
picture was an original, and had been painted by Queen Elizabeth's
command, on the lid of her favourite pair of bellows!</p>
<p>It really would seem that the more absurd a deception is, the better it
succeeds. All Paris was in delight at possessing an original
Shakespeare, while the London amateurs were in despair at such a
treasure being lost to England. The ingenious person soon found a
purchaser, and a high price recompensed him for his trouble. But more
remains to be told. The happy purchaser took his treasure to Ribet, the
first Parisian picture-cleaner of the day, to be cleaned. Ribet set to
work; but we may fancy his surprise as the superficial <emphasis>impasto</emphasis> of
Zincke washed off beneath the sponge, and Shakespeare became a female in
a lofty headgear adorned with blue ribbons.</p>
<p>In a furious passion the purchaser ran to the seller. "Let us talk over
the affair quietly," said the latter; "I have been cheated as well as
you: let us keep the matter secret; if we let the public know it, all
Paris and even London too, will be laughing at us. I will return you
your money, and take back the picture, if you will employ Ribet to
restore it to the same condition as it was in when you received it."
This fair proposition was acceded to, and Ribet restored the picture;
but as he was a superior artist to Zincke, he greatly improved it, and
this improvement was attributed to his skill as a cleaner. The secret
being kept, and the picture, improved by cleaning, being again in the
market, Talma, the great Tragedian, purchased it at even a higher price
than that given by the first buyer. Talma valued it highly, enclosed it
in a case of morocco and gold, and subsequently refused 1000 Napoleons
for it; and even when at last its whole history was disclosed, he still
cherished it as a genuine memorial of the great bard.</p>
<p>By kind permission of Mr. B.B. MacGeorge, the owner both of the letter
and bellows, I was enabled to give a reproduction of the portrait in my
large edition.</p>

<p>LETTER 292</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN HOWARD PAYNE</strong></p>
<p>[Autumn, 1822.]</p>
<p>Dear Payne—A friend and fellow-clerk of mine, Mr. White (a good fellow)
coming to your parts, I would fain have accompanied him, but am forced
instead to send a part of me, verse and prose, most of it from 20 to 30
years old, such as I then was, and I am not much altered.</p>
<p>Paris, which I hardly knew whether I liked when I was in it, is an
object of no small magnitude with me now. I want to be going, to the
Jardin des Plantes (is that right, Louisa?) with you to Pere de la
Chaise, La Morgue, and all the sentimentalities. How is Talma, and his
(my) dear Shakspeare?</p>
<p>N.B.—My friend White knows Paris thoroughly, and does not want a guide.
We did, and had one. We both join in thanks. Do you remember a Blue-Silk
Girl (English) at the Luxembourg, that did not much seem to attend to
the Pictures, who fell in love with you, and whom I fell in love
with—an inquisitive, prying, curious Beauty—where is she?</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLOIS AGNEAU,</strong></p>
<p><emphasis>alias</emphasis> C. LAMB.</p>
<p>Guichy is well, and much as usual. He seems blind to all the
distinctions of life, except to those of sex. Remembrance to Kenny and
Poole.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[John Howard Payne (1792-1852) was born in New York. He began life as an
actor in 1809 as Young Norval in "Douglas," and made his English <emphasis>début</emphasis>
in 1813 in the same part. For several years he lived either in London or
Paris, where among his friends were Washington Irving and Talma. He
wrote a number of plays, and in one of them, "Clari, or the Maid of
Milan," is the song "Home, Sweet Home," with Bishop's music, on which
his immortality rests. Payne died in Tunis, where he was American
Consul, in 1852, and when in 1883 he was reinterred at Washington, it
was as the author of "Home, Sweet Home." He seems to have been a
charming but ill-starred man, whom to know was to love.</p>
<p>Mr. White was Edward White of the India House, by whom Lamb probably
sent a copy of the 1818 edition of his <emphasis>Works</emphasis>. Louisa was Louisa
Holcroft. Guichy was possibly the Frenchman, mentioned by Crabb
Robinson, with whom the Lambs had travelled to France. Poole was, I
imagine, John Poole, the dramatist, author of burlesque plays in the
<emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> and later of "Paul Pry," which, it is quite likely, he
based on Lamb's sketch "Tom Pry."]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: 9 October 1822.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—I am asham'd not sooner to have acknowledged your letter and
poem. I think the latter very temperate, very serious and very
seasonable. I do not think it will convert the club at Pisa, neither do
I think it will satisfy the bigots on our side the water. Something like
a parody on the song of Ariel would please them better.</p>
<p>        Full fathom five the Atheist lies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of his bones are hell-dice made.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I want time, or fancy, to fill up the rest. I sincerely sympathise with
you on your doleful confinement. Of Time, Health, and Riches, the first
in order is not last in excellence. Riches are chiefly good, because
they give us Time. What a weight of wearisome prison hours have [I] to
look back and forward to, as quite cut out [of] life—and the sting of
the thing is, that for six hours every day I have no business which I
could not contract into two, if they would let me work Task-work. I
shall be glad to hear that your grievance is mitigated.</p>
<p>Shelly I saw once. His voice was the most obnoxious squeak I ever was
tormented with, ten thousand times worse than the Laureat's, whose voice
is the worst part about him, except his Laureatcy. Lord Byron opens upon

Heaven and his Hell in the presumptuous manner he has done, was a piece

very much out, but I will tell no tales of myself. I will therefore end
(after my best thanks, with a hope to see you again some time in
London), begging you to accept this Letteret for a Letter—a Leveret
makes a better present than a grown hare, and short troubles (as the old
excuse goes) are best.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.R. HAYDON</strong></p>
<p>India House, 9th October, 1822.</p>
<p>Dear Haydon, Poor Godwin has been turned out of his house and business
in Skinner Street, and if he does not pay two years' arrears of rent, he
will have the whole stock, furniture, &amp;c., of his new house (in the
Strand) seized when term begins. We are trying to raise a subscription
for him. My object in writing this is simply to ask you, if this is a
kind of case which would be likely to interest Mrs. Coutts in his
behalf; and who in your opinion is the best person to speak with her on
his behalf. Without the aid of from £300 to £400 by that time, early in
November, he must be ruined. You are the only person I can think of, of
her acquaintance, and can, perhaps, if not yourself, recommend the
person most likely to influence her. Shelley had engaged to clear him of
all demands, and he has gone down to the deep insolvent.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN HOWARD PAYNE</strong></p>
<p>Thursday [Oct. 22], 1822.</p>
<p>"Ali Pacha" will do. I sent my sister the first night, not having been
able to go myself, and her report of its effect was most favourable. I
saw it last night—the third night—and it was most satisfactorily
received. I have been sadly disappointed in Talfourd, who does the
critiques in the "Times," and who promised his strenuous services; but
by some damn'd arrangement he was sent to the wrong house, and a most
iniquitous account of Ali substituted for his, which I am sure would
have been a kind one. The "Morning Herald" did it ample justice, without
appearing to puff it. It is an abominable misrepresentation of the
"Times," that Farren played Ali like Lord Ogilby. He acted infirmity of
body, but not of voice or purpose. His manner was even grand. A grand
old gentleman. His falling to the earth when his son's death was
announced was fine as anything I ever saw. It was as if he had been
blasted. Miss Foote looked helpless and beautiful, and greatly helped
the piece. It is going on steadily, I am sure, for <emphasis>many nights</emphasis>. Marry,
I was a little disappointed with Hassan, who tells us he subsists by
cracking court jests before Hali, but he made none. In all the rest,
scenery and machinery, it was faultless. I hope it will bring you here.
I should be most glad of that. I have a room for you, and you shall
order your own dinner three days in the week. I must retain my own
authority for the rest. As far as magazines go, I can answer for
Talfourd in the "New Monthly." He cannot be put out there. But it is
established as a favourite, and can do without these expletives. I long
to talk over with you the Shakspeare Picture. My doubts of its being a
forgery mainly rest upon the goodness of the picture. The bellows might
be trumped up, but where did the painter spring from? Is Ireland a
consummate artist—or any of Ireland's accomplices?—but we shall confer
upon it, I hope. The "New Times," I understand was favorable to "Ali,"
but I have not seen it. I am sensible of the want of method in this
letter, but I have been deprived of the connecting organ, by a practice
I have fallen into since I left Paris, of taking too much strong spirits
of a night. I must return to the Hotel de l'Europe and Macon.</p>

<p>Dear Sir,—I have to acknowledge your kind attention to my application
to Mr. Haydon. I have transmitted your draft to Mr. G[odwin]'s committee
as an anonymous contribution through me. Mr. Haydon desires his thanks
and best respects to you, but was desirous that I should write to you on
this occasion. I cannot pass over your kind expressions as to myself. It
is not likely that I shall ever find myself in Scotland, but should the
event ever happen, I should be proud to pay my respects to you in your
own land. My disparagement of heaths and highlands—if I said any such
thing in half earnest,—you must put down as a piece of the old Vulpine
policy. I must make the most of the spot I am chained to, and console
myself for my flat destiny as well as I am able. I know very well our
mole-hills are not mountains, but I must cocker them up and make them
look as big and as handsome as I can, that we may both be satisfied.
Allow me to express the pleasure I feel on an occasion given me of
writing to you, and to subscribe myself, dear sir, your obliged and
respectful servant,</p>

pig-lovers, ever tasted. The dressing and the sauce were pronounced
incomparable by two friends, who had the good fortune to drop in to

<p>LETTER 299</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN HOWARD PAYNE</strong></p>
<p>Wednesday, 13 November, '22.</p>
<p>Dear P.—Owing to the inconvenience of having two lodgings, I did not
get your letter quite so soon as I should. The India House is my proper
address, where I am sure for the fore part of every day. The instant I
got it, I addressed a letter, for Kemble to see, to my friend Henry
Robertson, the Treasurer of Covent Garden Theatre. He had a conference
with Kemble, and the result is, that Robertson, in the name of the
management, recognized to me the full ratifying of your bargain: £250
for Ali, the Slaves, and another piece which they had not received. He
assures me the whole will be paid you, or the proportion for the two
former, as soon as ever the Treasury will permit it. He offered to write
the same to you, if I pleased. He thinks in a month or so they will be
able to liquidate it. He is positive no trick could be meant you, as Mr.
Planche's alterations, which were trifling, were not at all considered
as affecting your bargain. With respect to the copyright of Ali, he was
of opinion no money would be given for it, as Ali is quite laid aside.
This explanation being given, you would not think of printing the two
copies together by way of recrimination. He told me the secret of the
two Galley Slaves at Drury Lane. Elliston, if he is informed right,
engaged Poole to translate it, but before Poole's translation arrived,
finding it coming out at Cov. Gar., he procured copies of two several
translations of it in London. So you see here are four translations,
reckoning yours. I fear no copyright would be got for it, for anybody
may print it and anybody has. Your's has run seven nights, and R. is of
opinion it will not exceed in number of nights the nights of Ali,—about
thirteen. But your full right to your bargain with the management is in
the fullest manner recognized by him officially. He gave me every hope
the money will be spared as soon as they can spare it. He said <emphasis>a month
or two</emphasis>, but seemed to me to mean about <emphasis>a month</emphasis>. A new lady is coming
out in Juliet, to whom they look very confidently for replenishing their
treasury. Robertson is a very good fellow and I can rely upon his
statement. Should you have any more pieces, and want to get a copyright
for them, I am the worst person to negotiate with any bookseller, having
been cheated by all I have had to do with (except Taylor and
Hessey,—but they do not publish theatrical pieces), and I know not how
to go about it, or who to apply to. But if you had no better negotiator,
I should know the minimum you expect, for I should not like to make a
bargain out of my own head, being (after the Duke of Wellington) the
worst of all negotiators. I find from Robertson you have written to
Bishop on the subject. Have you named anything of the copyright of the
Slaves. R. thinks no publisher would pay for it, and you would not
risque it on your own account. This is a mere business letter, so I will
just send my love to my little wife at Versailles, to her dear mother,
etc.</p>

<p>[Payne's translation of the French play was produced at Covent Garden on
November 6, 1822, under the title "The Soldier's Daughter." On the same
night appeared a rival version at Drury Lane entitled "Two Galley
Slaves." Payne's was played eleven times. The new lady as Juliet was the
other Fanny Kelly not Lamb's: Fanny H. Kelly, from Dublin. The revival
began on November 14. Planché was James Robinson Planché (1796-1880),
the most prolific of librettists. Robert William Elliston, of whom Lamb
later wrote so finely, was then managing Drury Lane.</p>

<p>My dear Friend,—How do you like Harwood? Is he not a noble boy? I
congratulate you most heartily on this happy meeting, and only wish I
were present to witness it. Come back with Harwood, I am dying to see
you—we will talk, that is, you shall talk and I will listen from ten in
the morning till twelve at night. My thoughts are often with you, and
your children's dear faces are perpetually before me. Give them all one
additional kiss every morning for me. Remember there's one for Louisa,
one to Ellen, one to Betsy, one to Sophia, one to James, one to Teresa,
one to Virginia, and one to Charles. Bless them all! When shall I ever
see them again? Thank you a thousand times for all your kindness to me.
I know you will make light of the trouble my illness gave you; but the
recollection of it often sits heavy on my heart. If I could ensure my
health, how happy should I be to spend a month with you every summer!</p>
<p>When I met Mr. Kenney there, I sadly repented that I had not dragged you
on to Dieppe with me. What a pleasant time we should have spent there!</p>
<p>You shall not be jealous of Mr. Payne. Remember he did Charles and I
good service without grudge or grumbling. Say to him how much I regret
that we owe him unreturnable obligations; for I still have my old fear
that we shall never see him again. I received great pleasure from seeing
his two successful pieces. My love to your boy Kenney, my boy James, and
all my dear girls, and also to Rose; I hope she still drinks wine with
you. Thank Lou-Lou for her little bit of letter. I am in a fearful
hurry, or I would write to her. Tell my friend the Poetess that I expect
some French verses from her shortly. I have shewn Betsy's and Sophy's
letters to all who came near me, and they have been very much admired.
Dear Fanny brought me the bag. Good soul you are to think of me! Manning
has promised to make Fanny a visit this morning, happy girl! Miss James
I often see, I think never without talking of you. Oh the dear long
dreary Boulevards! how I do wish to be just now stepping out of a Cuckoo
into them!</p>
<p>Farewel, old tried friend, may we meet again! Would you could bring your
house with all its noisy inmates, and plant it, garden, gables and all,
in the midst of Covent Garden.</p>

<p>Who will take these Papers, as they were meant; not understanding every
thing perversely in the absolute and literal sense, but giving fair
construction as to an after-dinner conversation; allowing for the
rashness and necessary incompleteness of first thoughts; and not
remembering, for the purpose of an after taunt, words spoken
peradventure after the fourth glass. The Author wishes (what he would
will for himself) plenty of good friends to stand by him, good books to
solace him, prosperous events to all his honest undertakings, and a
candid interpretation to his most hasty words and actions. The other
sort (and he hopes many of them will purchase his book too) he greets
with the curt invitation of Timon, "Uncover, dogs, and lap:" or he
dismisses them with the confident security of the philosopher, "you beat
but on the case of ELIA."</p>

pounded to death in a mortar, by command of Alexander the Great, he made
use of this phrase. After these words, in Canon Ainger's transcript,
Lamb remarks:—"On better consideration, pray omit that Dedication. The
Essays want no Preface: they are <emphasis>all Preface</emphasis>. A Preface is nothing but
a talk with the reader; and they do nothing else. Pray omit it.</p>
<p>"There will be a sort of Preface in the next Magazine, which may act as
an advertisement, but not proper for the volume.</p>
<p>"Let ELIA come forth bare as he was born."</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WALTER WILSON</strong></p>
<p>E.I.H. 16 dec. 22.</p>
<p>Dear Wilson</p>
<p><emphasis>Lightening</emphasis> I was going to call you—</p>
<p>You must have thought me negligent in not answering your letter sooner.
But I have a habit of never writing letters, but at the office—'tis so
much time cribbed out of the Company—and I am but just got out of the
thick of a Tea Sale, in which most of the Entry of Notes, deposits &amp;c.
usually falls to my share. Dodwell is willing, but alas! slow. To
compare a pile of my notes with his little hillock (which has been as
long a building), what is it but to compare Olympus with a mole-hill.
Then Wadd is a sad shuffler.—</p>
<p>I have nothing of Defoe's but two or three Novels, and the Plague
History. I can give you no information about him. As a slight general
character of what I remember of them (for I have not look'd into them
latterly) I would say that "in the appearance of <emphasis>truth</emphasis> in all the
incidents and conversations that occur in them they exceed any works of
fiction I am acquainted with. It is perfect illusion. The <emphasis>Author</emphasis> never
appears in these self-narratives (for so they ought to be called or
rather Autobiographies) but the <emphasis>narrator</emphasis> chains us down to an implicet
belief in every thing he says. There is all the minute detail of a
log-book in it. Dates are painfully pressed upon the memory. Facts are
repeated over and over in varying phrases, till you cannot chuse but
believe them. It is like reading Evidence given in a Court of Justice.
So anxious the story-teller seems, that the truth should be clearly
comprehended, that when he has told us a matter of fact, or a motive, in
a line or two farther down he <emphasis>repeats</emphasis> it with his favorite figure of
speech, 'I say' so and so,—though he had made it abundantly plain
before. This is in imitation of the common people's way of speaking, or
rather of the way in which they are addressed by a master or mistress,
who wishes to impress something upon their memories; and has a wonderful
effect upon matter-of-fact readers. Indeed it is to such principally
that he writes. His style is elsewhere beautiful, but plain <emphasis>&amp; homely</emphasis>.
Robinson Crusoe is delightful to all ranks and classes, but it is easy
to see that it is written in phraseology peculiarly adapted to the lower
conditions of readers: hence it is an especial favorite with seafaring
men, poor boys, servant maids &amp;c. His novels are capital
kitchen-reading, while they are worthy from their deep interest to find
a shelf in the Libraries of the wealthiest, and the most learned. His
passion for <emphasis>matter of fact narrative</emphasis> sometimes betrayed him into a
long relation of common incidents which might happen to any man, and
have no interest but the intense appearance of truth in them, to
recommend them. The whole latter half, or two thirds, of Colonel Jack is
of this description. The beginning of Colonel Jack is the most affecting
natural picture of a young thief that was ever drawn. His losing the
stolen money in the hollow of a tree, and finding it again when he was
in despair, and then being in equal distress at not knowing how to
dispose of it, and several similar touches in the early history of the
Colonel, evince a deep knowledge of human nature; and, putting out of
question the superior <emphasis>romantic</emphasis> interest of the latter, in my mind very
much exceed Crusoe. Roxana (1st Edition) is the next in Interest, though
he left out the best part of it**in** subsequent Editions from a foolish
hypercriticism of his friend, Southerne. But Moll Flanders, the account
of the Plague &amp;c. &amp;c. are all of one family, and have the same stamp of
character."—</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: 23 December 1822.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—I have been so distracted with business and one thing or
other, I have not had a quiet quarter of an hour for epistolary
purposes. Christmas too is come, which always puts a rattle into my
morning scull. It is a visiting unquiet un-Quakerish season. I get more
and more in love with solitude, and proportionately hampered with
company. I hope you have some holydays at this period. I have one day,
Christmas day, alas! too few to commemorate the season. All work and no
play dulls me. Company is not play, but many times hard work. To play,
is for a man to do what he pleases, or to do nothing—to go about
soothing his particular fancies. I have lived to a time of life, to have
outlived the good hours, the nine o'Clock suppers, with a bright hour or

and then sit gaping, music-bothered perhaps, till half-past 12 brings up
the tray, and what you steal of convivial enjoyment after, is heavily
paid for in the disquiet of to-morrow's head.</p>
<p>I am pleased with your liking John Woodvil, and amused with your
knowledge of our drama being confined to Shakspeare and Miss Bailly.
What a world of fine territory between Land's End and Johnny Grots have
you missed traversing. I almost envy you to have so much to read. I feel
as if I had read all the Books I want to read. O to forget Fielding,
Steele, &amp;c., and read 'em new.</p>
<p>Can you tell me a likely place where I could pick up, cheap, Fox's
Journal? There are no Quaker Circulating Libraries? Ellwood, too, I must
have. I rather grudge that S[outhe]y has taken up the history of your
People. I am afraid he will put in some Levity. I am afraid I am not
quite exempt from that fault in certain magazine Articles, where I have
introduced mention of them. Were they to do again, I would reform them.</p>
<p>Why should not you write a poetical Account of your old Worthies,
deducing them from Fox to Woolman?—but I remember you did talk of
something in that kind, as a counterpart to the Ecclesiastical Sketches.
But would not a Poem be more consecutive than a string of Sonnets? You
have no Martyrs <emphasis>quite to the Fire</emphasis>, I think, among you. But plenty of
Heroic Confessors, Spirit-Martyrs—Lamb-Lions.—Think of it.</p>
<p>It would be better than a series of Sonnets on "Eminent Bankers."—I
like a hit at our way of life, tho' it does well for me, better than
anything short of <emphasis>all one's time to one's self</emphasis>, for which alone I
rankle with envy at the rich. Books are good, and Pictures are good, and
Money to buy them therefore good, but to buy <emphasis>TIME!</emphasis> in other words,
LIFE—</p>
<p>The "compliments of the time to you" should end my letter; to a Friend I
suppose I must say the "sincerity of the season;" I hope they both mean
the same. With excuses for this hastily penn'd note, believe me with
great respect—</p>

work, the property of John T. Shewell of Ipswich, is lent for six months
to Charles Lamb, at the request of Sam'l Alexander of Needham, Ipswich,

which he has derived from the perusal of it."</p>

<p>Here might come an undated and unpublished letter from Lamb to Basil
Montagu, which is of little interest except as referring to Miss James,
Mary Lamb's nurse. Lamb says that she was one of four sisters, daughters
of a Welsh clergyman, who all became nurses at Mrs. Warburton's, Hoxton,
whither, I imagine, Mary Lamb had often retired. Mrs. Parsons, one of
the sisters, became Mary Lamb's nurse when, some time after Lamb's
death, she moved to 41 Alpha Road, Mrs. Parsons' house. The late John
Hollingshead, great-nephew of these ladies, says in his interesting
book, <emphasis>My Lifetime</emphasis>, that their father was rector of Beguildy, in

<p>LETTER 304</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN HOWARD PAYNE</strong></p>
<p>[January, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Payne—Your little books are most acceptable. 'Tis a delicate
edition. They are gone to the binder's. When they come home I shall have
two—the "Camp" and "Patrick's Day"—to read for the first time. I may
say three, for I never read the "School for Scandal." "<emphasis>Seen</emphasis> it I have,
and in its happier days." With the books Harwood left a truncheon or
mathematical instrument, of which we have not yet ascertained the use.
It is like a telescope, but unglazed. Or a ruler, but not smooth enough.
It opens like a fan, and discovers a frame such as they weave lace upon
at Lyons and Chambery. Possibly it is from those parts. I do not value
the present the less, for not being quite able to detect its purport.
When I can find any one coming your way I have a volume for you, my
Elias collected. Tell Poole, his Cockney in the Lon. Mag. tickled me
exceedingly. Harwood is to be with us this evening with Fanny, who comes
to introduce a literary lady, who wants to see me,—and whose portentous
name is <emphasis>Plura</emphasis>, in English "many things." Now, of all God's creatures,
I detest letters-affecting, authors-hunting ladies. But Fanny "will have
it so." So Miss Many Things and I are to have a conference, of which you
shall have the result. I dare say she does not play at whist. Treasurer
Robertson, whose coffers are absolutely swelling with pantomimic
receipts, called on me yesterday to say he is going to write to you, but
if I were also, I might as well say that your last bill is at the
Banker's, and will be honored on the instant receipt of the third Piece,
which you have stipulated for. If you have any such in readiness, strike
while the iron is hot, before the Clown cools. Tell Mrs. Kenney, that
the Miss F.H. (or H.F.) Kelly, who has begun so splendidly in Juliet, is
the identical little Fanny Kelly who used to play on their green before
their great Lying-Inn Lodgings at Bayswater. Her career has stopt short
by the injudicious bringing her out in a vile new Tragedy, and for a
third character in a stupid old one,—the Earl of Essex. This is
Macready's doing, who taught her. Her recitation, &amp;c. (<emphasis>not her voice or
person</emphasis>), is masculine. It is so clever, it seemed a male <emphasis>Debut</emphasis>. But
cleverness is the bane of Female Tragedy especially. Passions uttered
logically, &amp;c. It is bad enough in men-actors. Could you do nothing for
little Clara Fisher? Are there no French Pieces with a Child in them? By
Pieces I mean here dramas, to prevent male-constructions. Did not the
Blue Girl remind you of some of Congreve's women? Angelica or Millamant?
To me she was a vision of Genteel Comedy realized. Those kind of people
never come to see one. <emphasis>N'import</emphasis>—havn't I Miss Many Things coming?

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MR. AND MRS. J.D. COLLIER</strong></p>
<p>Twelfth Day [January 6], 1823.</p>
<p>THE pig was above my feeble praise. It was a dear pigmy. There was some
contention as to who should have the ears, but in spite of his obstinacy
(deaf as these little creatures are to advice) I contrived to get at one
of them.</p>
<p>It came in boots too, which I took as a favor. Generally those petty
toes, pretty toes! are missing. But I suppose he wore them, to look
taller.</p>
<p>He must have been the least of his race. His little foots would have
gone into the silver slipper. I take him to have been Chinese, and a
female.—</p>
<p>If Evelyn could have seen him, he would never have farrowed two such
prodigious volumes, seeing how much good can be contained in—how small
a compass!</p>
<p>He crackled delicately.</p>
<p>John Collier Jun has sent me a Poem which (without the smallest bias
from the aforesaid present, believe me) I pronounce <emphasis>sterling</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I set about Evelyn, and finished the first volume in the course of a
natural day. To-day I attack the second—Parts are very interesting.—</p>
<p>I left a blank at top of my letter, not being determined <emphasis>which</emphasis> to
address it to, so Farmer and Farmer's wife will please to divide our
thanks. May your granaries be full, and your rats empty, and your

<p>LETTER 308</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>9 Jan., 1823.</p>
<p>"Throw yourself on the world without any rational plan of support,
beyond what the chance employ of Booksellers would afford you"!!!</p>
<p>Throw yourself rather, my dear Sir, from the steep Tarpeian rock,
slap-dash headlong upon iron spikes. If you had but five consolatory
minutes between the desk and the bed, make much of them, and live a
century in them, rather than turn slave to the Booksellers. They are
Turks and Tartars, when they have poor Authors at their beck. Hitherto
you have been at arm's length from them. Come not within their grasp. I
have known many authors for bread, some repining, others envying the
blessed security of a Counting House, all agreeing they had rather have
been Taylors, Weavers, what not? rather than the things they were. I
have known some starved, some to go mad, one clear friend literally
dying in a workhouse. You know not what a rapacious, dishonest set those
booksellers are. Ask even Southey, who (a single case almost) has made a
fortune by book drudgery, what he has found them. O you know not, may
you never know! the miseries of subsisting by authorship. 'Tis a pretty
appendage to a situation like yours or mine, but a slavery worse than
all slavery to be a book-seller's dependent, to drudge your brains for
pots of ale and breasts of mutton, to change your free thoughts and
voluntary numbers for ungracious TASK-WORK. Those fellows hate <emphasis>us</emphasis>. The
reason I take to be, that, contrary to other trades, in which the Master
gets all the credit (a Jeweller or Silversmith for instance), and the
Journeyman, who really does the fine work, is in the background, in
<emphasis>our</emphasis> work the world gives all the credit to Us, whom <emphasis>they</emphasis> consider
as
<emphasis>their</emphasis> Journeymen, and therefore do they hate us, and cheat us, and
oppress us, and would wring the blood of us out, to put another sixpence
in their mechanic pouches. I contend, that a Bookseller has a <emphasis>relative
honesty</emphasis> towards Authors, not like his honesty to the rest of the world.
B[aldwin], who first engag'd me as Elia, has not paid me up yet (nor any
of us without repeated mortifying applials), yet how the Knave fawned
while I was of service to him! Yet I dare say the fellow is punctual in
settling his milk-score, &amp;c. Keep to your Bank, and the Bank will keep
you. Trust not to the Public, you may hang, starve, drown yourself, for
anything that worthy <emphasis>Personage</emphasis> cares. I bless every star that
Providence, not seeing good to make me independent, has seen it next
good to settle me upon the stable foundation of Leadenhall. Sit down,
good B.B., in the Banking Office; what, is there not from six to Eleven
P.M. 6 days in the week, and is there not all Sunday? Fie, what a
superfluity of man's time,—if you could think so! Enough for
relaxation, mirth, converse, poetry, good thoughts, quiet thoughts. O
the corroding torturing tormenting thoughts, that disturb the Brain of
the unlucky wight, who must draw upon it for daily sustenance.
Henceforth I retract all my fond complaints of mercantile employment,
look upon them as Lovers' quarrels. I was but half in earnest. Welcome,
dead timber of a desk, that makes me live. A little grumbling is a
wholesome medicine for the spleen; but in my inner heart do I approve
and embrace this our close but unharassing way of life. I am quite
serious. If you can send me Fox, I will not keep it six <emphasis>weeks</emphasis>, and
will return it, with warm thanks to yourself and friend, without blot or
dog's ear. You much oblige me by this kindness.</p>

<p>[Barton had long been meditating the advisability of giving up his place
in the bank at Woodbridge and depending upon his pen. Lamb's letter of
dissuasion is not the only one which he received. Byron had written to
him in 1812: "You deserve success; but we knew, before Addison wrote his
Cato, that desert does not always command it. But suppose it attained—</p>

and sure resource." Barton had now broken again into dissatisfaction
with his life. He did not, however, leave the bank.</p>

Robertson, who says that the Piece which is to be Operafied was sent to
you six weeks since by a Mr. Hunter, whose journey has been delayed, but
he supposes you have it by this time. On receiving it back properly
done, the rest of your dues will be forthcoming. You have received £30
from Harwood, I hope? Bishop was at the theatre when Mary called, and he
has put your other piece into C. Kemble's hands (the piece you talk of
offering Elliston) and C.K. sent down word that he had not yet had time
to read it. So stand your affairs at present. Glossop has got the
Murderer. Will you address him on the subject, or shall I—that is,
Mary? She says you must write more <emphasis>showable</emphasis> letters about these

<p>February [9], 1823.</p>
<p>My dear Miss Lamb—I have enclosed for you Mr. Payne's piece called
Grandpapa, which I regret to say is not thought to be of the nature that
will suit this theatre; but as there appears to be much merit in it, Mr.
Kemble strongly recommends that you should send it to the English Opera
House, for which it seems to be excellently adapted. As you have already
been kind enough to be our medium of communication with Mr. Payne, I
have imposed this trouble upon you; but if you do not like to act for
Mr. Payne in the business, and have no means of disposing of the piece,
I will forward it to Paris or elsewhere as you think he may prefer.</p>

<p><strong>HENRY ROBERTSON.</strong></p>
<p>T.R.C.G., 8 Feb. 1823.</p>
<p>Dear P—— We have just received the above, and want your instructions.
It strikes me as a very merry little piece, that should be played by
<emphasis>very young actors</emphasis>. It strikes me that Miss Clara Fisher would play the
<emphasis>boy</emphasis> exactly. She is just such a forward chit. No young <emphasis>man</emphasis> would do
it without its appearing absurd, but in a girl's hands it would have
just all the reality that a short dream of an act requires. Then for the
sister, if Miss Stevenson that was, were Miss Stevenson and younger,
they two would carry it off. I do not know who they have got in that
young line, besides Miss C.F., at Drury, nor how you would like Elliston
to have it—has he not had it? I am thick with Arnold, but I have always
heard that the very slender profits of the English Opera House do not
admit of his giving above a trifle, or next to none, for a piece of this
kind. Write me what I should do, what you would ask, &amp;c. The music
(printed) is returned with the piece, and the French original. Tell Mr.
Grattan I thank him for his book, which as far as I have read it is a
very <emphasis>companionable one</emphasis>. I have but just received it. It came the same
hour with your packet from Cov. Gar., i.e. yester-night late, to my
summer residence, where, tell Kenney, the cow is quiet. Love to all at
Versailles. Write quickly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C.L.</strong></p>
<p>I have no acquaintance with Kemble at all, having only met him once or
twice; but any information, &amp;c., I can get from R., who is a good
fellow, you may command. I am sorry the rogues are so dilitory, but I
distinctly believe they mean to fulfill their engagement. I am sorry you
are not here to see to these things. I am a poor man of business, but
command me to the short extent of my tether. My sister's kind

<p>LETTER 311</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. February 17, 1823.]</p>
<p>My dear Sir—I have read quite through the ponderous folio of G.F. I
think Sewell has been judicious in omitting certain parts, as for
instance where G.F. <emphasis>has</emphasis> revealed to him the natures of all the
creatures in their names, as Adam had. He luckily turns aside from that
compendious study of natural history, which might have superseded
Buffon, to his proper spiritual pursuits, only just hinting what a
philosopher he might have been. The ominous passage is near the
beginning of the Book. It is clear he means a physical knowledge,
without trope or figure. Also, pretences to miraculous healing and the
like are more frequent than I should have suspected from the epitome in
Sewell. He is nevertheless a great spiritual man, and I feel very much
obliged by your procuring me the Loan of it. How I like the Quaker
phrases—though I think they were hardly completed till Woolman. A
pretty little manual of Quaker language (with an endeavour to explain
them) might be gathered out of his Book. Could not you do it? I have
read through G.F. without finding any explanation of the term <emphasis>first
volume</emphasis> in the title page. It takes in all, both his life and his death.
Are there more Last words of him? Pray, how may I venture to return it
to Mr. Shewell at Ipswich? I fear to send such a Treasure by a Stage
Coach. Not that I am afraid of the Coachman or the Guard <emphasis>reading</emphasis> it.
But it might be lost. Can you put me in a way of sending it in safety?
The kind hearted owner trusted it to me for six months. I think I was
about as many days in getting through it, and I do not think that I
skipt a word of it. I have quoted G.F. in my Quaker's meeting, as having
said he was "lifted up in spirit" (which I felt at the time to be not a
Quaker phrase), "and the Judge and Jury were as dead men under his
feet." I find no such words in his Journal, and I did not get them from
Sewell, and the latter sentence I am sure I did not mean to invent. I
must have put some other Quaker's words into his mouth. Is it a fatality
in me, that every thing I touch turns into a Lye? I once quoted two
Lines from a translation of Dante, which Hazlitt very greatly admired,
and quoted in a Book as proof of the stupendous power of that poet, but
no such lines are to be found in the translation, which has been
searched for the purpose. I must have dreamed them, for I am quite
certain I did not forge them knowingly. What a misfortune to have a
Lying memory.—Yes, I have seen Miss Coleridge, and wish I had just such
a—daughter. God love her—to think that she should have had to toil
thro' five octavos of that cursed (I forget I write to a Quaker)
Abbeypony History, and then to abridge them to 3, and all for £113. At
her years, to be doing stupid Jesuits' Latin into English, when she
should be reading or writing Romances. Heaven send her Uncle do not
breed her up a Quarterly Reviewer!—which reminds me, that he has spoken
very respectfully of you in the last number, which is the next thing to
having a Review all to one's self. Your description of Mr. Mitford's
place makes me long for a pippin and some carraways and a cup of sack in

<p>"I once quoted two Lines." Possibly, Mr. A.R. Waller suggests to me, the
lines:—</p>
<p>            Because on earth their names</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

       In Fame's eternal volume shine for aye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>quoted by Hazlitt in his <emphasis>Round Table</emphasis> essay "On Posthumous Fame," and
again in one of his <emphasis>Edinburgh Review</emphasis> articles. They are presumably
based upon the <emphasis>Inferno</emphasis>, Canto IV. (see Haselfoot's translation, second
edition, 1899, page 21, lines 74-78). But the "manufacturer" of them
must have had Spenser's line in his mind, "On Fame's eternall bead-roll
worthie to be fyled" (<emphasis>Faerie Queene</emphasis>, Bk. IV., Canto II., Stanza 32).
They have not yet been found in any translation of Dante. This
explanation would satisfy Lamb's words "quoted in a book," i.e., <emphasis>The
Round Table</emphasis>, published in 1817.</p>
<p>"Miss Coleridge"—Coleridge's daughter Sara, born in 1802, who had been
brought up by her uncle, Southey. She had translated Martin
Dobrizhoffer's Latin history of the Abipones in order to gain funds for
her brother Derwent's college expenses. Her father considered the
translation "unsurpassed for pure mother English by anything I have read
for a long time." Sara Coleridge married her cousin, Henry Nelson
Coleridge, in 1829. She edited her father's works and died in 1852. At
the present time she and her mother were visiting the Gillmans.</p>
<p>Mr. Mitford was John Mitford (1781-1859), rector of Benhall, in Suffolk,
and editor of old poets. Later he became editor of the <emphasis>Gentleman's
Magazine</emphasis>. He was a cousin of Mary Russell Mitford. In the <emphasis>Gentleman's
Magazine</emphasis> for May, 1838, is a review of Talfourd's edition of Lamb's
<emphasis>Letters</emphasis>, probably from his pen, in which he records a visit to the
Lambs in 1827.]</p>

<p>LETTER 312</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WALTER WILSON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: February 24, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear W.—I write that you may not think me neglectful, not that I have
any thing to say. In answer to your questions, it was at <emphasis>your</emphasis> house I
saw an edition of Roxana, the preface to which stated that the author
had left out that part of it which related to Roxana's daughter
persisting in imagining herself to be so, in spite of the mother's
denial, from certain hints she had picked up, and throwing herself
continually in her mother's way (as Savage is said to have done in
<emphasis>his</emphasis>, prying in at windows to get a glimpse of her), and that it was by
advice of Southern, who objected to the circumstances as being untrue,
when the rest of the story was founded on fact; which shows S. to have
been a stupid-ish fellow. The incidents so resemble Savage's story, that
I taxed Godwin with taking Falconer from his life by Dr. Johnson. You
should have the edition (if you have not parted with it), for I saw it
never but at your place at the Mews' Gate, nor did I then read it to
compare it with my own; only I know the daughter's curiosity is the best
part of <emphasis>my</emphasis> Roxana. The prologue you speak of was mine, so named, but
not worth much. You ask me for 2 or 3 pages of verse. I have not written
so much since you knew me. I am altogether prosaic. May be I may touch
off a sonnet in time. I do not prefer Col. Jack to either Rob. Cr. or
Roxana. I only spoke of the beginning of it, his childish history. The
rest is poor. I do not know anywhere any good character of De Foe
besides what you mention. I do not know that Swift mentions him. Pope
does. I forget if D'Israeli has. Dunlop I think has nothing of him. He
is quite new ground, and scarce known beyond Crusoe. I do not know who
wrote Quarll. I never thought of Quarll as having an author. It is a
poor imitation; the monkey is the best in it, and his pretty dishes made
of shells. Do you know the Paper in the Englishman by Sir Rd. Steele,
giving an account of Selkirk? It is admirable, and has all the germs of
Crusoe. You must quote it entire. Captain G. Carleton wrote his own
Memoirs; they are about Lord Peterborough's campaign in Spain, &amp; a good
Book. Puzzelli puzzles me, and I am in a cloud about Donald M'Leod. I
never heard of them; so you see, my dear Wilson, what poor assistances I
can give in the way of information. I wish your Book out, for I shall
like to see any thing about De Foe or from you.</p>
<p>Your old friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>From my and your old compound. 24 Feb. '23.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[With this letter compare the letter on September 9, 1801, to Godwin,
and the letter on December 16, 1822, to Wilson.</p>
<p>Defoe's <emphasis>Roxana</emphasis>, first edition, does not, as a matter of fact, contain
the episode of the daughter which Lamb so much admired. Later editions
have it. Godwin says in his Preface to "Faulkener," 1807, the play to
which Lamb wrote a prologue in praise of Defoe (see Vol. IV.), that the
only accessible edition of <emphasis>Roxana</emphasis> in which the story of Susannah is
fully told is that of 1745.</p>
<p>Richard Savage was considered to be the natural son of the Countess of
Macclesfield and Earl Rivers. His mother at first disowned him, but
afterwards, when this became impossible, repulsed him. Johnson says in
his "Life of Savage," that it was his hero's "practice to walk in the
dark evenings for several hours before her door in hopes of seeing her
as she might come by accident to the window or cross her apartment with
a candle in her hand."</p>
<p>Swift and Defoe were steady enemies, although I do not find that either
mentions the other by name. But Swift in <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis> often had Defoe
in mind, and Defoe in one of his political writings refers to Swift,
<emphasis>apropos</emphasis> Wood's halfpence, as "the copper farthing author."</p>
<p>Pope referred to Defoe twice in the <emphasis>Dunciad</emphasis>: once as standing high,
fearless and unabashed in the pillory, and once, libellously, as the
father of Norton, of the <emphasis>Flying Post</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Philip Quarll</emphasis> was the first imitation of <emphasis>Robinson Crusoe</emphasis>. It was
published in 1727, purporting to be the narrative of one Dorrington, a
merchant, and Quarll's discoverer. The title begins, <emphasis>The Hermit; or,
The Unparalleled Sufferings and Surprising Adventures of Mr. Philip
Quarll, an Englishman</emphasis> … Lamb says in his essay on Christ's Hospital
that the Blue-Coat boys used to read the book. The authorship of the
book is still unknown.</p>
<p>Steele's account of Selkirk is in <emphasis>The Englishman</emphasis>, No. 26, Dec. 1,
1713. Wilson quoted it.</p>
<p>Defoe's fictitious <emphasis>Military Memoirs of Capt. George Carleton</emphasis> was
published in 1728.</p>
<p>I cannot explain Puzzelli or Donald M'Leod. Later Lamb sent Wilson, who
seems to have asked for some verse about Defoe, the "Ode to the
Treadmill," but Wilson did not use it.</p>
<p>"My old compound." Robinson's <emphasis>Diary</emphasis> (Vol. I., page 333) has this: "The
large room in the accountant's office at the East India House is divided
into boxes or compartments, in each of which sit six clerks, Charles
Lamb himself in one. They are called Compounds. The meaning of the word
was asked one day, and Lamb said it was 'a collection of simples.'"]</p>

<p>LETTER 313</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: March 11, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—The approbation of my little book by your sister is very
pleasing to me. The Quaker incident did not happen to me, but to
Carlisle the surgeon, from whose mouth I have twice heard it, at an
interval of ten or twelve years, with little or no variation, and have
given it as exactly as I could remember it. The gloss which your sister,
or you, have put upon it does not strike me as correct. Carlisle drew no
inference from it against the honesty of the Quakers, but only in favour
of their surprising coolness—that they should be capable of committing
a good joke, with an utter insensibility to its being any jest at all. I
have reason to believe in the truth of it, because, as I have said, I
heard him repeat it without variation at such an interval. The story
loses sadly in print, for Carlisle is the best story teller I ever
heard. The idea of the discovery of roasting pigs, I also borrowed, from
my friend Manning, and am willing to confess both my plagiarisms.</p>
<p>Should fate ever so order it that you shall be in town with your sister,
mine bids me say that she shall have great pleasure in being introduced
to her. I think I must give up the cause of the Bank—from nine to nine
is galley-slavery, but I hope it is but temporary. Your endeavour at
explaining Fox's insight into the natures of animals must fail, as I
shall transcribe the passage. It appears to me that he stopt short in
time, and was on the brink of falling with his friend Naylor, my
favourite.—The book shall be forthcoming whenever your friend can make
convenient to call for it.</p>
<p>They have dragged me again into the Magazine, but I feel the spirit of
the thing in my own mind quite gone. "Some brains" (I think Ben Jonson
says it) "will endure but one skimming." We are about to have an
inundation of poetry from the Lakes, Wordsworth and Southey are coming
up strong from the North. The she Coleridges have taken flight, to my
regret. With Sara's own-made acquisitions, her unaffectedness and
no-pretensions are beautiful. You might pass an age with her without
suspecting that she knew any thing but her mother's tongue. I don't mean
any reflection on Mrs. Coleridge here. I had better have said her
vernacular idiom. Poor C. I wish he had a home to receive his daughter
in. But he is but as a stranger or a visitor in this world. How did you
like Hartley's sonnets? The first, at least, is vastly fine. Lloyd has
been in town a day or two on business, and is perfectly well. I am
ashamed of the shabby letters I send, but I am by nature anything but
neat. Therein my mother bore me no Quaker. I never could seal a letter
without dropping the wax on one side, besides scalding my fingers. I
never had a seal too of my own. Writing to a great man lately, who is
moreover very Heraldic, I borrowed a seal of a friend, who by the female
side quarters the Protectorial Arms of Cromwell. How they must have
puzzled my correspondent!—My letters are generally charged as double at
the Post office, from their inveterate clumsiness of foldure. So you
must not take it disrespectful to your self if I send you such ungainly
scraps. I think I lose £100 a year at the India House, owing solely to
my want of neatness in making up Accounts. How I puzzle 'em out at last
is the wonder. I have to do with millions. <emphasis>I?</emphasis></p>

<p>[Lamb had sent <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> to Woodbridge. Bernard Barton's sister was Maria
Hack, author of many books for children. The Quaker incident is in the
essay "Imperfect Sympathies." Carlisle was Sir Anthony Carlisle.</p>
<p>"Your endeavour at explaining Fox's insight." See letter above. James
Nayler (1617?-1660), an early Quaker who permitted his admirers to look
upon him as a new Christ. He went to extremes totally foreign to the
spirit of the Society. Barton made a paraphrase of Nayler's "Last
Testimony."</p>
<p>"They have dragged me again." Lamb had been quite ready to give up
<emphasis>Elia</emphasis> with the first essays. "Old China," one of his most charming
papers, was in the March <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"Some brains …" I had to give this up in my large edition. I now find
that Swift says it, not Ben Jonson. "There is a brain that will endure
but one scumming." Preface to <emphasis>Battle of the Books</emphasis>.</p>

the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for February, 1823, addressed to R.S. Jameson.</p>

<p>LETTER 314</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. 5 April 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—You must think me ill mannered not to have replied to your
first letter sooner, but I have an ugly habit of aversion from letter
writing, which makes me an unworthy correspondent. I have had no spring,
or cordial call to the occupation of late. I have been not well lately,
which must be my lame excuse. Your poem, which I consider very
affecting, found me engaged about a humorous Paper for the London, which
I had called a "Letter to an <emphasis>Old Gentleman</emphasis> whose Education had been
neglected"—and when it was done Taylor and Hessey would not print it,
and it discouraged me from doing any thing else, so I took up Scott,
where I had scribbled some petulant remarks, and for a make shift
father'd them on Ritson. It is obvious I could not make your Poem a part
of them, and as I did not know whether I should ever be able to do to my
mind what you suggested, I thought it not fair to keep back the verses
for the chance. Mr. Mitford's sonnet I like very well; but as I also
have my reasons against interfering at all with the Editorial
arrangement of the London, I transmitted it (not in my own hand-writing)
to them, who I doubt not will be glad to insert it. What eventual
benefit it can be to you (otherwise than that a kind man's wish is a
benefit) I cannot conjecture. Your Society are eminently men of
Business, and will probably regard you as an idle fellow, possibly
disown you, that is to say, if you had put your own name to a sonnet of
that sort, but they cannot excommunicate Mr. Mitford, therefore I
thoroughly approve of printing the said verses. When I see any Quaker
names to the Concert of Antient Music, or as Directors of the British
Institution, or bequeathing medals to Oxford for the best classical
themes, etc.—then I shall begin to hope they will emancipate you. But
what as a Society can they do for you? you would not accept a Commission
in the Army, nor they be likely to procure it; Posts in Church or State
have they none in their giving; and then if they disown you—think—you
must live "a man forbid."</p>
<p>I wishd for you yesterday. I dined in Parnassus, with Wordsworth,
Coleridge, Rogers, and Tom Moore—half the Poetry of England
constellated and clustered in Gloster Place! It was a delightful Even!
Coleridge was in his finest vein of talk, had all the talk, and let 'em
talk as evilly as they do of the envy of Poets, I am sure not one there
but was content to be nothing but a listener. The Muses were dumb, while
Apollo lectured on his and their fine Art. It is a lie that Poets are
envious, I have known the best of them, and can speak to it, that they
give each other their merits, and are the kindest critics as well as
best authors. I am scribbling a muddy epistle with an aking head, for we
did not quaff Hippocrene last night. Many, it was Hippocras rather. Pray
accept this as a letter in the mean time, and do me the favor to mention
my respects to Mr. Mitford, who is so good as to entertain good thoughts
of Elia, but don't show this almost impertinent scrawl. I will write
more respectfully next time, for believe me, if not in words, in
feelings, yours most so.</p>

<p>["Your poem." Barton's poem was entitled "A Poet's Thanks," and was
printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for April, 1823, the same number that
contained Lamb's article on Ritson and Scott. It is one of his best
poems, an expression of contentment in simplicity. The "Letter to an Old
Gentleman," a parody of De Quincey's series of "Letters to a Young
Gentleman" in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, was not published until January,
1825. Scott was John Scott of Amwell (Barton's predecessor as the Quaker
poet), who had written a rather foolish book of prose, <emphasis>Critical Essays
on the English Poets</emphasis>. Ritson was Joseph Ritson, the critic and
antiquarian. See Vol. I. of the present edition for the essay. Barton
seems to have suggested to Lamb that he should write an essay around the
poem "A Poet's Thanks." Mitford's sonnet, which was printed in the
<emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for June, 1823, was addressed commiseratingly to
Bernard Barton. It began:—</p>
<p>            What to thy broken Spirit can atone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Unhappy victim of the Tyrant's fears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and continued in the same strain, the point being that Barton was the
victim of his Quaker employers, who made him "prisoner at once and
slave." Lamb's previous letter shows us that Barton was being worked
from nine till nine, and we must suppose also that an objection to his
poetical exercises had been lodged or suggested. The matter righted
itself in time.</p>
<p>"I dined in Parnassus." This dinner, at Thomas Monkhouse's, No. 34
Gloucester Place, is described both by Moore and by Crabb Robinson, who
was present. Moore wrote in his <emphasis>Journal</emphasis>:—</p>
<p>"Dined at Mr. Monkhouse's (a gentleman I had never seen before) on
Wordsworth's invitation, who lives there whenever he comes to town. A
singular party. Coleridge, Rogers, Wordsworth and wife, Charles Lamb
(the hero at present of the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>), and his sister (the poor
woman who went mad in a diligence on the way to Paris), and a Mr.
Robinson, one of the <emphasis>minora sidera</emphasis> of this constellation of the Lakes;
the host himself, a Maecenas of the school, contributing nothing but
good dinners and silence. Charles Lamb, a clever fellow, certainly, but
full of villainous and abortive puns, which he miscarries of every
minute. Some excellent things, however, have come from him."</p>
<p>Lamb told Moore that he had hitherto always felt an antipathy to him,
but henceforward should like him.</p>
<p>Crabb Robinson writes:—</p>
<p>"<emphasis>April 4th</emphasis>.—Dined at Monkhouse's. Our party consisted of Wordsworth,
Coleridge, Lamb, Moore, and Rogers. Five poets of very unequal worth and
most disproportionate popularity, whom the public probably would arrange
in the very inverse order, except that it would place Moore above
Rogers. During this afternoon, Coleridge alone displayed any of his
peculiar talent. He talked much and well. I have not for years seen him
in such excellent health and spirits. His subjects metaphysical
criticism—Wordsworth he chiefly talked to. Rogers occasionally let fall
a remark. Moore seemed conscious of his inferiority. He was very
attentive to Coleridge, but seemed to relish Lamb, whom he sat next. L.
was in a good frame—kept himself within bounds and was only cheerful at
last…. I was at the bottom of the table, where I very ill performed my
part…. I walked home late with Lamb."</p>
<p>Many years later Robinson sent to The Athenaeum (June 25, 1853) a
further and fuller account of the evening.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.W. PROCTER</strong></p>
<p>April 13th, 1823.</p>
<p>Dear Lad,—You must think me a brute beast, a rhinoceros, never to have
acknowledged the receipt of your precious present. But indeed I am none
of those shocking things, but have arrived at that indisposition to
letter-writing, which would make it a hard exertion to write three lines
to a king to spare a friend's life. Whether it is that the Magazine
paying me so much a page, I am loath to throw away composition—how much
a sheet do you give your correspondents? I have hung up Pope, and a gem
it is, in my town room; I hope for your approval. Though it accompanies
the "Essay on Man," I think that was not the poem he is here meditating.
He would have looked up, somehow affectedly, if he were just conceiving
"Awake, my St. John." Neither is he in the "Rape of the Lock" mood
exactly. I think he has just made out the last lines of the "Epistle to
Jervis," between gay and tender,</p>
<p>        "And other beauties envy Worsley's eyes."</p>
<p>I'll be damn'd if that isn't the line. He is brooding over it, with a
dreamy phantom of Lady Mary floating before him. He is thinking which is
the earliest possible day and hour that she will first see it. What a
miniature piece of gentility it is! Why did you give it me? I do not
like you enough to give you anything so good.</p>
<p>I have dined with T. Moore and breakfasted with Rogers, since I saw you;
have much to say about them when we meet, which I trust will be in a
week or two. I have been over-watched and over-poeted since Wordsworth
has been in town. I was obliged for health sake to wish him gone: but
now he is gone I feel a great loss. I am going to Dalston to recruit,
and have serious thoughts—of altering my condition, that is, of taking
to sobriety. What do you advise me?</p>
<p>T. Moore asked me your address in a manner which made me believe he
meant to call upon you.</p>

much reason as your</p>

<p>LETTER 316</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SARAH HUTCHINSON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. April 25, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Miss H——, Mary has such an invincible reluctance to any
epistolary exertion, that I am sparing her a mortification by taking the
pen from her. The plain truth is, she writes such a pimping, mean,
detestable hand, that she is ashamed of the formation of her letters.
There is an essential poverty and abjectness in the frame of them. They
look like begging letters. And then she is sure to omit a most
substantial word in the second draught (for she never ventures an
epistle, without a foul copy first) which is obliged to be interlined,
which spoils the neatest epistle, you know [<emphasis>the word "epistle" is
underlined</emphasis>). Her figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c., where she has occasion to
express numerals, as in the date (25 Apr 1823), are not figures, but
Figurantes. And the combined posse go staggering up and down shameless
as drunkards in the day time. It is no better when she rules her paper,
her lines are "not less erring" than her words—a sort of unnatural
parallel lines, that are perpetually threatening to meet, which you know
is quite contrary to Euclid [<emphasis>here Lamb has ruled lines grossly
unparallel</emphasis>]. Her very blots are not bold like this [<emphasis>here a bold
blot</emphasis>], but poor smears [<emphasis>here a poor smear</emphasis>] half left in and half
scratched out with another smear left in their place. I like a clean
letter. A bold free hand, and a fearless flourish. Then she has always
to go thro' them (a second operation) to dot her i s, and cross her t s.
I don't think she can make a cork screw, if she tried—which has such a
fine effect at the end or middle of an epistle—and fills up—</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Here Lamb has made a corkscrew two inches long</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>There is a corkscrew, one of the best I ever drew. By the way what
incomparable whiskey that was of Monkhouse's. But if I am to write a
letter, let me begin, and not stand flourishing like a fencer at a fair.</p>
<p>It gives me great pleasure (the letter now begins) to hear that you got
down smoothly, and that Mrs. Monkhouse's spirits are so good and
enterprising. It shews, whatever her posture may be, that her mind at
least is not supine. I hope the excursion will enable the former to keep
pace with its out-stripping neighbor. Pray present our kindest wishes to
her, and all. (That sentence should properly have come in the Post
Script, but we airy Mercurial Spirits, there is no keeping us in).
Time—as was said of one of us—toils after us in vain. I am afraid our
co-visit with Coleridge was a dream. I shall not get away before the end
(or middle) of June, and then you will be frog-hopping at Boulogne. And
besides I think the Gilmans would scarce trust him with us, I have a
malicious knack at cutting of apron strings. The Saints' days you speak
of have long since fled to heaven, with Astraea, and the cold piety of
the age lacks fervor to recall them—only Peter left his key—the iron
one of the two, that shuts amain—and that's the reason I am lockd up.
Meanwhile of afternoons we pick up primroses at Dalston, and Mary
corrects me when I call 'em cowslips. God bless you all, and pray
remember me euphoneously to Mr. Gnwellegan. That Lee Priory must be a
dainty bower, is it built of flints, and does it stand at Kingsgate? Did
you remem</p>

<p>Well, I am discovered—and thou thyself, who thoughtest to shelter under
the pease-cod of initiality (a stale and shallow device), art no less
dragged to light—Thy slender anatomy—thy skeletonian D—— fleshed and
sinewed out to the plump expansion of six characters—thy tuneful
genealogy deduced—</p>
<p>By the way, what a name is Timothy!</p>
<p>Lay it down, I beseech thee, and in its place take up the properer sound
of Timotheus—</p>
<p>Then mayst thou with unblushing fingers handle the Lyre "familiar to the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

D——n name."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>With much difficulty have I traced thee to thy lurking-place. Many a
goodly name did I run over, bewildered between Dorrien, and Doxat, and
Dover, and Dakin, and Daintry—a wilderness of D's—till at last I
thought I had hit it—my conjectures wandering upon a melancholy
Jew—you wot the Israelite upon Change—Master Daniels—a contemplative
Hebrew— to the which guess I was the rather led, by the consideration
that most of his nation are great readers—</p>
<p>Nothing is so common as to see them in the Jews' Walk, with a bundle of
script in one hand, and the Man of Feeling, or a volume of Sterne, in
the other—</p>
<p>I am a rogue if I can collect what manner of face thou carriest, though
thou seemest so familiar with mine—If I remember, thou didst not dimly
resemble the man Daniels, whom at first I took thee for—a care-worn,
mortified, economical, commercio-political countenance, with an
agreeable limp in thy gait, if Elia mistake thee not. I think I sh'd
shake hands with thee, if I met thee.</p>
<p>[John Bates Dibdin, the son of Charles Dibdin the younger and grandson
of the great Charles Dibdin, was at this time a young man of about
twenty-four, engaged as a clerk in a shipping office in the city. I
borrow from Canon Ainger an interesting letter from a sister of Dibdin
on the beginning of the correspondence:—</p>
<p>My brother … had constant occasion to conduct the giving or taking of
cheques, as it might be, at the India House. There he always selected
"the little clever man" in preference to the other clerks. At that time
the <emphasis>Elia Essays</emphasis> were appearing in print. No one had the slightest
conception who "Elia" was. He was talked of everywhere, and everybody
was trying to find him out, but without success. At last, from the style
and manner of conveying his ideas and opinions on different subjects, my
brother began to suspect that Lamb was the individual so widely sought
for, and wrote some lines to him, anonymously, sending them by post to
his residence, with the hope of sifting him on the subject. Although
Lamb could not <emphasis>know</emphasis> who sent him the lines, yet he looked very hard at
the writer of them the next time they met, when he walked up, as usual,
to Lamb's desk in the most unconcerned manner, to transact the necessary
business. Shortly after, when they were again in conversation, something
dropped from Lamb's lips which convinced his hearer, beyond a doubt,
that his suspicions were correct. He therefore wrote some more lines
(anonymously, as before), beginning—</p>
<p>            "I've found thee out, O Elia!"</p>
<p>and sent them to Colebrook Row. The consequence was that at their next
meeting Lamb produced the lines, and after much laughing, confessed
himself to be <emphasis>Elia</emphasis>. This led to a warm friendship between them.</p>
<p>Dibdin's letter of discovery was signed D. Hence Lamb's fumbling after
his Christian name, which he probably knew all the time.]</p>

<p>LETTER 319</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. 3 May, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—I am vexed to be two letters in your debt, but I have been
quite out of the vein lately. A philosophical treatise is wanting, of
the causes of the backwardness with which persons after a certain time
of life set about writing a letter. I always feel as if I had nothing to
say, and the performance generally justifies the presentiment. Taylor
and Hessey did foolishly in not admitting the sonnet. Surely it might
have followed the B.B. I agree with you in thinking Bowring's paper
better than the former. I will inquire about my Letter to the Old
Gentleman, but I expect it to <emphasis>go in</emphasis>, after those to the Young Gent'n
are completed. I do not exactly see why the Goose and little Goslings
should emblematize <emphasis>a Quaker poet that has no children</emphasis>. But after
all—perhaps it is a Pelican. The Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin around it I
cannot decypher. The songster of the night pouring out her effusions
amid a Silent Meeting of Madge Owlets, would be at least intelligible. A
full pause here comes upon me, as if I had not a word more left. I will
shake my brain. Once— twice—nothing comes up. George Fox recommends
waiting on these occasions. I wait. Nothing comes. G. Fox—that sets me
off again. I have finished the Journal, and 400 more pages of the
<emphasis>Doctrinals</emphasis>, which I picked up for 7s. 6d. If I get on at this rate,
the Society will be in danger of having two Quaker poets—to patronise.
I am at Dalston now, but if, when I go back to Cov. Gar., I find thy
friend has not call'd for the Journal, thee must put me in a way of
sending it; and if it should happen that the Lender of it, having that
volume, has not the other, I shall be most happy in his accepting the
Doctrinals, which I shall read but once certainly. It is not a splendid
copy, but perfect, save a leaf of Index.</p>
<p>I cannot but think <emphasis>the London</emphasis> drags heavily. I miss Janus. And O how
it misses Hazlitt! Procter too is affronted (as Janus has been) with
their abominable curtailment of his things—some meddling Editor or
other—or phantom of one —for neither he nor Janus know their busy
friend. But they always find the best part cut out; and they have done
well to cut also. I am not so fortunate as to be served in this manner,
for I would give a clean sum of money in sincerity to leave them
handsomely. But the dogs—T. and H. I mean— will not affront me, and
what can I do? must I go on to drivelling? Poor Relations is
tolerable—but where shall I get another subject—or who shall deliver
me from the body of this death? I assure you it teases me more than it
used to please me. Ch. Lloyd has published a sort of Quaker poem, he
tells me, and that he has order'd me a copy, but I have not got it. Have
you seen it? I must leave a little wafer space, which brings me to an
apology for a conclusion. I am afraid of looking back, for I feel all
this while I have been writing nothing, but it may show I am alive.
Believe me, cordially yours                           C. LAMB.</p>

up the magazine for press. In the May number, in addition to Lamb's
"Poor Relations," were contributions from De Quincey, Hartley Coleridge,
Cary, and Barton. But it was not what it had been.</p>
<p>Lloyd's Quaker poem would probably be one of those in his <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, 1823,

publishing antiquarian works on Ludgate Hill, had sent Lamb his <emphasis>Ancient

<p>LETTER 321</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MARY LAMB TO MRS. RANDAL NORRIS</strong></p>
<p>Hastings, at Mrs. Gibbs, York Cottage, Priory, No. 4. [June 18, 1823.]</p>
<p>My dear Friend,—Day after day has passed away, and my brother has said,
"I will write to Mrs. [? Mr.] Norris to-morrow," and therefore I am
resolved to write to <emphasis>Mrs. Norris</emphasis> to-day, and trust him no longer. We
took our places for Sevenoaks, intending to remain there all night in
order to see Knole, but when we got there we chang'd our minds, and went
on to Tunbridge Wells. About a mile short of the Wells the coach stopped
at a little inn, and I saw, "Lodgings to let" on a little, very little
house opposite. I ran over the way, and secured them before the coach
drove away, and we took immediate possession: it proved a very
comfortable place, and we remained there nine days. The first evening,
as we were wandering about, we met a lady, the wife of one of the India
House clerks, with whom we had been slightly acquainted some years ago,
which slight acquaintance has been ripened into a great intimacy during
the nine pleasant days that we passed at the Wells. She and her two
daughters went with us in an open chaise to Knole, and as the chaise
held only five, we mounted Miss James upon a little horse, which she
rode famously. I was very much pleased with Knole, and still more with
Penshurst, which we also visited. We saw Frant and the Rocks, and made
much use of your Guide Book, only Charles lost his way once going by the
map. We were in constant exercise the whole time, and spent our time so
pleasantly that when we came here on Monday we missed our new friends
and found ourselves very dull. We are by the seaside in a <emphasis>still less
house</emphasis>, and we have exchanged a very pretty landlady for a very ugly
one, but she is equally attractive to us. We eat turbot, and we drink
smuggled Hollands, and we walk up hill and down hill all day long. In
the little intervals of rest that we allow ourselves I teach Miss James
French; she picked up a few words during her foreign Tour with us, and
she has had a hankering after it ever since.</p>
<p>We came from Tunbridge Wells in a Postchaise, and would have seen Battle
Abbey on the way, but it is only shewn on a Monday. We are trying to
coax Charles into a Monday's excursion. And Bexhill we are also thinking
about. Yesterday evening we found out by chance the most beautiful view
I ever saw. It is called "The Lovers' Seat."… You have been here,
therefore you must have seen [it, or] is it only Mr. and Mrs. Faint who
have visited Hastings? [Tell Mrs.] Faint that though in my haste to get
housed I d[ecided on] … ice's lodgings, yet it comforted all th … to
know that I had a place in view.</p>
<p>I suppose you are so busy that it is not fair to ask you to write me a
line to say how you are going on. Yet if any one of you have half an
hour to spare for that purpose, it will be most thankfully received.
Charles joins with me in love to you all together, and to each one in
particular upstairs and downstairs.</p>
<p>Yours most affectionately,                      M. LAMB. June 18</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Mr. Hazlitt dates this letter 1825 or 1826, and considers it to refer
to a second visit to Hastings; but I think most probably it refers to
the 1823 visit, especially as the Lovers' Seat would assuredly have been
discovered then. Miss James was Mary Lamb's nurse. Mrs. Randal Norris
had been a Miss Faint.</p>
<p>There is a curious similarity between a passage in this letter and in
one of Byron's, written in 1814: "I have been swimming, and eating
turbot, and smuggling neat brandies, and silk handkerchiefs … and
walking on cliffs and tumbling down hills."</p>
<p>A Hastings guide book for 1825 gives Mrs. Gibbs' address as 4 York
Cottages, near Priory Bridge. Near by, in Pelham Place, a Mr. Hogsflesh
had a lodging-house.]</p>

<p>LETTER 322</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. 10 July, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—I shall be happy to read the MS. and to forward it; but T. and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

H. must judge for themselves of publication. If it prove interesting (as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I doubt not) I shall not spare to say so, you may depend upon it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Suppose you direct it to Acco'ts. Office, India House.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I am glad you have met with some sweetening circumstances to your
unpalatable draught. I have just returned from Hastings, where are
exquisite views and walks, and where I have given up my soul to walking,
and I am now suffering sedentary contrasts. I am a long time reconciling
to Town after one of these excursions. Home is become strange, and will
remain so yet a while. Home is the most unforgiving of friends and
always resents Absence; I know its old cordial looks will return, but
they are slow in clearing up. That is one of the features of this <emphasis>our</emphasis>
galley slavery, that peregrination ended makes things worse. I felt out
of water (with all the sea about me) at Hastings, and just as I had
learned to domiciliate there, I must come back to find a home which is
no home. I abused Hastings, but learned its value. There are spots,
inland bays, etc., which realise the notions of Juan Fernandez.</p>
<p>The best thing I lit upon by accident was a small country church (by
whom or when built unknown) standing bare and single in the midst of a
grove, with no house or appearance of habitation within a quarter of a
mile, only passages diverging from it thro' beautiful woods to so many
farm houses. There it stands, like the first idea of a church, before
parishioners were thought of, nothing but birds for its congregation, or
like a Hermit's oratory (the Hermit dead), or a mausoleum, its effect
singularly impressive, like a church found in a desert isle to startle
Crusoe with a home image; you must make out a vicar and a congregation
from fancy, for surely none come there. Yet it wants not its pulpit, and
its font, and all the seemly additaments of <emphasis>our</emphasis> worship.</p>
<p>Southey has attacked Elia on the score of infidelity, in the Quarterly,
Article, "Progress of Infidels [Infidelity]." I had not, nor have, seen
the Monthly. He might have spared an old friend such a construction of a
few careless flights, that meant no harm to religion. If all his
UNGUARDED expressions on the subject were to be collected—</p>
<p>But I love and respect Southey—and will not retort. I HATE HIS REVIEW,
and his being a Reviewer.</p>
<p>The hint he has dropped will knock the sale of the book on the head,
which was almost at a stop before.</p>
<p>Let it stop. There is corn in Egypt, while there is cash at Leadenhall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You and I are something besides being Writers. Thank God.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Yours truly                                          C.L.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[What the MS. was I do not know. Lamb recurs more fully to the
description of the little church—probably Hollingdon Rural, about three
miles north-west from the town—in later letters.</p>
<p>The thoughts in the second paragraph of this letter were amplified in
the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "The Old Margate Hoy," in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for
July, 1823.</p>
<p>"Southey has attacked Elia." In an article in the <emphasis>Quarterly</emphasis> for
January, 1823, in a review of a work by Grégoire on Deism in France,
under the title "The Progress of Infidelity," Southey had a reference to
<emphasis>Elia</emphasis> in the following terms:—</p>
<p>"Unbelievers have not always been honest enough thus to express their
real feelings; but this we know concerning them, that when they have
renounced their birthright of hope, they have not been able to divest
themselves of fear. From the nature of the human mind this might be
presumed, and in fact it is so. They may deaden the heart and stupify
the conscience, but they cannot destroy the imaginative faculty. There
is a remarkable proof of this in <emphasis>Elia's Essays</emphasis>, a book which wants
only a sounder religious feeling, to be as delightful as it is
original."</p>
<p>And then Southey went on to draw attention to the case of Thornton Hunt,
the little child of Leigh Hunt, the (to Southey) notorious free-thinker,
who, as Lamb had stated in the essay "Witches and Other Night Fears,"
would wake at night in terror of images of fear.</p>
<p>"I will not retort." Lamb, as we shall see, changed his mind.</p>
<p>"Almost at a stop before." <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> was never popular until long after
Lamb's death. It did not reach a second edition until 1836. There are
now several new editions every year.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: 2 September (1823).]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—What will you say to my not writing? You cannot say I do not
write now. Hessey has not used your kind sonnet, nor have I seen it.
Pray send me a Copy. Neither have I heard any more of your Friend's MS.,
which I will reclaim, whenever you please. When you come London-ward you
will find me no longer in Cov't Gard. I have a Cottage, in Colebrook
row, Islington. A cottage, for it is detach'd; a white house, with 6
good rooms; the New River (rather elderly by this time) runs (if a
moderate walking pace can be so termed) close to the foot of the house;
and behind is a spacious garden, with vines (I assure you), pears,
strawberries, parsnips, leeks, carrots, cabbages, to delight the heart
of old Alcinous. You enter without passage into a cheerful dining room,
all studded over and rough with old Books, and above is a lightsome
Drawing room, 3 windows, full of choice prints. I feel like a great
Lord, never having had a house before.</p>
<p>The London I fear falls off.—I linger among its creaking rafters, like
the last rat. It will topple down, if they don't get some Buttresses.
They have pull'd down three, W. Hazlitt, Proctor, and their best stay,
kind light hearted Wainwright —their Janus. The best is, neither of our
fortunes is concern'd in it.</p>
<p>I heard of you from Mr. Pulham this morning, and that gave a fillip to
my Laziness, which has been intolerable. But I am so taken up with
pruning and gardening, quite a new sort of occupation to me. I have
gather'd my Jargonels, but my Windsor Pears are backward. The former
were of exquisite raciness. I do now sit under my own vine, and
contemplate the growth of vegetable nature. I can now understand in what
sense they speak of FATHER ADAM. I recognise the paternity, while I
watch my tulips. I almost FELL with him, for the first day I turned a
drunken gard'ner (as he let in the serpent) into my Eden, and he laid
about him, lopping off some choice boughs, &amp;c., which hung over from a
neighbor's garden, and in his blind zeal laid waste a shade, which had
sheltered their window from the gaze of passers by. The old gentlewoman
(fury made her not handsome) could scarcely be reconciled by all my fine
words. There was no buttering her parsnips. She talk'd of the Law. What
a lapse to commit on the first day of my happy "garden-state."</p>
<p>I hope you transmitted the Fox-Journal to its Owner with suitable
thanks.</p>
<p>Mr. Cary, the Dante-man, dines with me to-day. He is a model of a
country Parson, lean (as a Curate ought to be), modest, sensible, no
obtruder of church dogmas, quite a different man from Southey,—you
would like him.</p>
<p>Pray accept this for a Letter, and believe me with sincere regards</p>
<p>Yours                                             C.L.</p>

<p>["Your kind sonnet." Barton's well-known sonnet to Elia (quoted below)
had been printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> long before—in the previous
February. I do not identify this one among his writings.</p>
<p>"I have a Cottage." This cottage still stands (1912). Within it is much
as in Lamb's day, but outwardly changed, for a new house has been built
on one side and it is thus no longer detached. The New River still runs
before it, but subterraneously.</p>
<p>Barton was so attracted by one at least of Lamb's similes that, I fancy,
he borrowed it for an account of his grandfather's house at Tottenham
which he wrote some time later; for I find that gentleman's garden
described as "equal to that of old Alcinous."</p>
<p>"Kind light hearted Wainwright." Lamb has caused much surprise by using
such words of one who was destined to become almost the most
cold-blooded criminal in English history; but, as Hartley Coleridge
wrote in another connection, it was Lamb's way to take things by the
better handle, and Wainewright's worst faults in those days seem to have
been extravagance and affectation. Lamb at any rate liked him and
Wainewright was proud to be on a footing with Elia and his sister, as we
know from his writings. Wainewright at this time was not quite
twenty-nine; he had painted several pictures, some of which were
accepted by the academy, and he had written a number of essays over
several different pseudonyms, chief of which was Janus Weathercock. He
lived in Great Marlborough Street in some style and there entertained
many literary men, among them Lamb. It was not until 1826 that his
criminal career began.</p>
<p>"Mr. Pulham"—Brook Pulham of the India House, who made the caricature
etching of Elia.</p>

have it on the authority of George Daniel, the antiquary, that with his
removal to Colebrooke Cottage began an interest in horticulture,
particularly in roses.</p>

<p>LETTER 329</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. September 17, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—I have again been reading your stanzas on Bloomfield, which
are the most appropriate that can be imagined, sweet with Doric
delicacy. I like that</p>
<p>            Our more chaste Theocritus—</p>
<p>just hinting at the fault of the Grecian. I love that stanza ending with</p>
<p>            Words phrases fashions pass away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            But Truth and nature live through all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But I shall omit in my own copy the one stanza which alludes to Lord
B.—I suppose. It spoils the sweetness and oneness of the feeling.
Cannot we think of Burns, or Thompson, without sullying the thought with
a reflection out of place upon Lord Rochester? These verses might have
been inscribed upon a tomb; are in fact an epitaph; satire does not look
pretty upon a tombstone. Besides, there is a quotation in it, always bad
in verse; seldom advisable in prose.</p>
<p>I doubt if their having been in a Paper will not prevent T. and H. from
insertion, but I shall have a thing to send in a day or two, and shall
try them. Omitting that stanza, a <emphasis>very little</emphasis> alteration is want'g in
the beginn'g of the next. You see, I use freedom. How happily (I flatter
not!) you have bro't in his subjects; and, (<emphasis>I suppose</emphasis>) his favorite
measure, though I am not acquainted with any of his writings but the
Farmer's Boy. He dined with me once, and his manners took me
exceedingly.</p>
<p>I rejoyce that you forgive my long silence. I continue to estimate my
own-roof comforts highly. How could I remain all my life a lodger! My
garden thrives (I am told) tho' I have yet reaped nothing but some tiny
sallad, and withered carrots. But a garden's a garden anywhere, and
twice a garden in London.</p>
<p>Somehow I cannot relish that word Horkey. Cannot you supply it by
circumlocution, and direct the reader by a note to explain that it means
the Horkey. But Horkey choaks me in the Text. It raises crowds of mean
associations, Hawking and sp——-g, Gauky, Stalky, Maukin. The sound is
every thing, in such dulcet modulations 'specially. I like</p>
<p>            Gilbert Meldrum's sterner tones,</p>
<p>without knowing who Gilbert Meldrum is. You have slipt in your rhymes as
if they grew there, so natural-artificially, or artificial-naturally.
There's a vile phrase.</p>
<p>Do you go on with your Quaker Sonnets—[to] have 'em ready with
Southey's Book of the Church? I meditate a letter to S. in the London,
which perhaps will meet the fate of the Sonnet.</p>
<p>Excuse my brevity, for I write painfully at office, liable to 100
callings off. And I can never sit down to an epistle elsewhere. I read
or walk. If you return this letter to the Post Office, I think they will
return 4d, seeing it is but half a one. Believe me tho' entirely yours
C.L.</p>

<p>[Barton's "Verses to the Memory of Bloomfield, the Suffolk Poet" (who
died in August, 1823), were printed in book form in his Poetic Vigils,
1824. This is the stanza that Lamb most liked:—</p>
<p>        It is not quaint and local terms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Besprinkled o'er thy rustic lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Though well such dialect confirms</p>

        It is not <emphasis>these</emphasis> that most display</p>

<p>

          Thy sweetest charms, thy gentlest thrall,—</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO CHARLES LLOYD</strong></p>
<p>[No date. Autumn, 1823.]</p>
<p>Your lines are not to be understood reading on one leg. They are
<emphasis>sinuous</emphasis>, and to be won with wrestling. I assure you in sincerity that
nothing you have done has given me greater satisfaction. Your obscurity,
where you are dark, which is seldom, is that of too much meaning, not
the painful obscurity which no toil of the reader can dissipate; not the
dead vacuum and floundering place in which imagination finds no footing;
it is not the dimness of positive darkness, but of distance; and he that
reads and not discerns must get a better pair of spectacles. I admire
every piece in the collection; I cannot say the first is best; when I do
so, the last read rises up in judgment. To your Mother—to your
Sister—to Mary dead—they are all weighty with thought and tender with
sentiment. Your poetry is like no other:—those cursed Dryads and Pagan
trumperies of modern verse have put me out of conceit of the very name
of poetry. Your verses are as good and as wholesome as prose; and I have
made a sad blunder if I do not leave you with an impression that your
present is rarely valued.</p>

"I had a very ample testimony from C. Lamb to the character of my last
little volume. I will transcribe to you what he says, as it is but a
note, and his manner is always so original, that I am sure the
introduction of the merest trifle from his pen will well compensate for
the absence of anything of mine." The volume was <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, 1823, one of
the chief of which was "Stanzas on the Difficulty with which, in Youth,
we Bring Home to our Habitual Consciousness, the Idea of Death," to
which Lloyd appended the following sentence from Elia's essay on "New
Year's Eve," as motto: "Not childhood alone, but the young man till
thirty, never feels practically that he is mortal. He knows it indeed,
and, if need were, he could preach a homily on the fragility of life;

<p>My dear Sir—Your Pig was a <emphasis>picture</emphasis> of a pig, and your Picture a <emphasis>pig</emphasis>
of a picture. The former was delicious but evanescent, like a hearty fit
of mirth, or the crackling of thorns under a pot; but the latter is an
<emphasis>idea</emphasis>, and abideth. I never before saw swine upon sattin. And then that
pretty strawy canopy about him! he seems to purr (rather than grunt) his
satisfaction. Such a gentlemanlike porker too! Morland's are absolutely
clowns to it. Who the deuce painted it?</p>
<p>I have ordered a little gilt shrine for it, and mean to wear it for a
locket; a shirt-pig.</p>
<p>I admire the petty-toes shrouded in a veil of something, not <emphasis>mud</emphasis>, but
that warm soft consistency with [? which] the dust takes in Elysium

pedant.</p>

<p>LETTER 334</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SARAH HAZLITT</strong></p>
<p>[No date. Early November, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. H.,—Sitting down to write a letter is such a painful
operation to Mary, that you must accept me as her proxy. You have seen
our house. What I now tell you is literally true. Yesterday week George
Dyer called upon us, at one o'clock (<emphasis>bright noon day</emphasis>) on his way to
dine with Mrs. Barbauld at Newington. He sat with Mary about half an
hour, and took leave. The maid saw him go out from her kitchen window;
but suddenly losing sight of him, ran up in a fright to Mary. G.D.,
instead of keeping the slip that leads to the gate, had deliberately,
staff in hand, in broad open day, marched into the New River. He had not
his spectacles on, and you know his absence. Who helped him out, they
can hardly tell; but between 'em they got him out, drenched thro' and
thro'. A mob collected by that time and accompanied him in. "Send for
the Doctor!" they said: and a one-eyed fellow, dirty and drunk, was
fetched from the Public House at the end, where it seems he lurks, for
the sake of picking up water practice, having formerly had a medal from
the Humane Society for some rescue. By his advice, the patient was put
between blankets; and when I came home at four to dinner, I found G.D.
a-bed, and raving, light-headed with the brandy-and-water which the
doctor had administered. He sung, laughed, whimpered, screamed, babbled
of guardian angels, would get up and go home; but we kept him there by
force; and by next morning he departed sobered, and seems to have
received no injury. All my friends are open-mouthed about having paling
before the river, but I cannot see that, because a.. lunatic chooses to
walk into a river with his eyes open at midday, I am any the more likely
to be drowned in it, coming home at midnight.</p>
<p>I had the honour of dining at the Mansion House on Thursday last, by
special card from the Lord Mayor, who never saw my face, nor I his; and
all from being a writer in a magazine! The dinner costly, served on
massy plate, champagne, pines, &amp;c.; forty-seven present, among whom the
Chairman and two other directors of the India Company. There's for you!
and got away pretty sober! Quite saved my credit!</p>
<p>We continue to like our house prodigiously. Does Mary Hazlitt go on with
her novel, or has she begun another? I would not discourage her, tho' we
continue to think it (so far) in its present state not saleable.</p>
<p>Our kind remembrances to her and hers and you and yours.—</p>
<p>                     Yours truly,                     C. LAMB.</p>
<p>I am pleased that H. liked my letter to the Laureate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Addressed to "Mrs. Hazlitt, Alphington, near Exeter." This letter is
the first draft of the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "Amicus Redivivus," which was
printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> in December, 1823. George Dyer, who was
then sixty-eight, had been getting blind steadily for some years. A
visit to Lamb's cottage to-day, bearing in mind that the ribbon of green
between iron railings that extends along Colebrooke Row was at that time
an open stream, will make the nature of G.D.'s misadventure quite
plain.</p>
<p>"Mary Hazlitt"-the daughter of John Hazlitt, the essayist's brother.</p>
<p>"I am pleased that H. liked my letter to the Laureate." Hazlitt wrote,
in the essay "On the Pleasures of Hating," "I think I must be friends
with Lamb again, since he has written that magnanimous Letter to
Southey, and told him a piece of his mind!" Coleridge also approved of
it, and Crabb Robinson's praise was excessive.</p>
<p>Here should come a note from Lamb to Mrs. Shelley dated Nov. 12, 1823,
saying that Dyer walked into the New River on Sunday week at one o'clock
with his eyes open.]</p>

<p>LETTER 335</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY</strong></p>
<p>E.I.H., 21st November, 1823.</p>
<p>DEAR Southey,-The kindness of your note has melted away the mist which
was upon me. I have been fighting against a shadow. That accursed
"Quarterly Review" had vexed me by a gratuitous speaking, of its own
knowledge, that the "Confessions of a Drunkard" was a genuine
description of the state of the writer. Little things, that are not ill
meant, may produce much ill. <emphasis>That</emphasis> might have injured me alive and
dead. I am in a public office, and my life is insured. I was prepared
for anger, and I thought I saw, in a few obnoxious words, a hard case of
repetition directed against me. I wished both magazine and review at the
bottom of the sea. I shall be ashamed to see you, and my sister (though
innocent) will be still more so; for the folly was done without her
knowledge, and has made her uneasy ever since. My guardian angel was
absent at that time.</p>
<p>I will muster up courage to see you, however, any day next week
(Wednesday excepted). We shall hope that you will bring Edith with you.
That will be a second mortification. She will hate to see us; but come
and heap embers. We deserve it, I for what I've done, and she for being
my sister.</p>
<p>Do come early in the day, by sun-light, that you may see my <emphasis>Milton</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I am at Colebrook Cottage, Colebrook Row, Islington. A detached whitish
house, close to the New River, end of Colebrook Terrace, left hand from
Sadler's Wells.</p>
<p>Will you let me know the day before?</p>
<p>Your penitent                         C. LAMB.</p>
<p>P.S.—I do not think your handwriting at all like Hunt's. I do not think
many things I did think.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[For the right appreciation of this letter Elia's Letter to Southey must
be read (see Vol. I. of the present edition). It was hard hitting, and
though Lamb would perhaps have been wiser had he held his hand, yet
Southey had taken an offensive line of moral superiority and rebuke, and
much that was said by Lamb was justified.</p>
<p>Southey's reply ran thus:—</p>
<p>    My Dear Lamb—On Monday I saw your letter in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>,
    which I had not before had an opportunity of seeing, and I now take
    the first interval of leisure for replying to it.</p>
<p>    Nothing could be further from my mind than any intention or
    apprehension of any way offending or injuring a man concerning whom
    I have never spoken, thought, or felt otherwise than with affection,
    esteem, and admiration.</p>
<p>    If you had let me know in any private or friendly manner that you
    felt wounded by a sentence in which nothing but kindness was
    intended—or that you found it might injure the sale of your book—I
    would most readily and gladly have inserted a note in the next
    Review to qualify and explain what had hurt you.</p>
<p>    You have made this impossible, and I am sorry for it. But I will not
    engage in controversy with you to make sport for the Philistines.</p>
<p>    The provocation must be strong indeed that can rouse me to do this,
    even with an enemy. And if you can forgive an unintended offence as
    heartily as I do the way in which you have resented it, there will
    be nothing to prevent our meeting as we have heretofore done, and
    feeling towards each other as we have always been wont to do.</p>
<p>    Only signify a correspondent willingness on your part, and send me
    your address, and my first business next week shall be to reach your
    door, and shake hands with you and your sister. Remember me to her
    most kindly and believe me—. Yours, with unabated esteem and
    regards, Robert Southey.</p>
<p>The matter closed with this exchange of letters, and no hostility
remained on either side.</p>
<p>Lamb's quarrel with the <emphasis>Quarterly</emphasis> began in 1811, when in a review of
Weber's edition of Ford Lamb was described as a "poor maniac." It was
renewed in 1814, when his article on Wordsworth's <emphasis>Excursion</emphasis> was
mutilated. It broke out again in 1822, as Lamb says here, when a
reviewer of Reid's treatise on <emphasis>Hypochondriasis and other Nervous
Affections</emphasis> (supposed to be Dr. Gooch, a friend of Dr. Henry Southey's)
referred to Lamb's "Confessions of a Drunkard" (see Vol. I.) as being,
from his own knowledge, true. Thus Lamb's patience was naturally at
breaking point when his own friend Southey attacked <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> a few numbers
later.</p>
<p>"I do not think your handwriting at all like Hunt's." Lamb had said, in
the Letter, of Leigh Hunt: "His hand-writing is so much the same with
your own, that I have opened more than one letter of his, hoping, nay,
not doubting, but it was from you, and have been disappointed (he will
bear with my saying so) at the discovery of my error."]</p>

<p>LETTER 336</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. November 22, 1823.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I am ashamed at not acknowledging your kind little poem,
which I must needs like much, but I protest I thought I had done it at
the moment. Is it possible a letter has miscarried? Did you get one in
which I sent you an extract from the poems of Lord Sterling? I should
wonder if you did, for I sent you none such.—There was an incipient lye
strangled in the birth. Some people's conscience is so tender! But in
plain truth I thank you very much for the verses. I have a very kind
letter from the Laureat, with a self-invitation to come and shake hands
with me. This is truly handsome and noble. 'Tis worthy of my old idea of
Southey. Shall not I, think you, be covered with a red suffusion?</p>
<p>You are too much apprehensive of your complaint. I know many that are
always ailing of it, and live on to a good old age. I know a merry
fellow (you partly know him) who when his Medical Adviser told him he
had drunk away all <emphasis>that part</emphasis>, congratulated himself (now his liver was
gone) that he should be the longest liver of the two. The best way in
these cases is to keep yourself as ignorant as you can—as ignorant as
the world was before Galen—of the entire inner construction of the
Animal Man—not to be conscious of a midriff—to hold kidneys (save of
sheep and swine) to be an agreeable fiction—not to know whereabout the
gall grows—to account the circulation of the blood an idle whimsey of
Harvey's—to acknowledge no mechanism not visible. For, once fix the
seat of your disorder, and your fancies flux into it like bad humours.
Those medical gentries chuse each his favourite part—one takes the
lungs—another the aforesaid liver—and refer to <emphasis>that</emphasis> whatever in the
animal economy is amiss. Above all, use exercise, take a little more
spirituous liquors, learn to smoke, continue to keep a good conscience,
and avoid tampering with hard terms of art—viscosity, schirossity, and
those bugbears, by which simple patients are scared into their grave.
Believe the general sense of the mercantile world, which holds that
desks are not deadly. It is the mind, good B.B., and not the limbs,
that taints by long sitting. Think of the patience of taylors—think how
long the Chancellor sits— think of the Brooding Hen.</p>
<p>I protest I cannot answer thy Sister's kind enquiry, but I judge I shall
put forth no second volume. More praise than buy, and T. and H. are not
particularly disposed for Martyrs.</p>
<p>Thou wilt see a funny passage, and yet a true History, of George Dyer's
Aquatic Incursion, in the next "London." Beware his fate, when thou
comest to see me at my Colebrook Cottage. I have filled my little space
with my little thoughts. I wish thee ease on thy sofa, but not too much
indulgence on it. From my poor desk, thy fellow-sufferer this bright
November,                                           C.L.</p>

<p>LETTER 337</p>
<p>CHARLES LAMB TO W. HARRISON AINSWORTH India-House, 9th Dec., 1823.</p>
<p>(If I had time I would go over this letter again, and dot all my i's.)</p>
<p>Dear Sir,—I should have thanked you for your Books and Compliments
sooner, but have been waiting for a revise to be sent, which does not
come, tho' I returned the proof on the receit of your letter. I have
read Warner with great pleasure. What an elaborate piece of alliteration
and antithesis! why it must have been a labour far above the most
difficult versification. There is a fine simile of or picture of
Semiramis arming to repel a siege. I do not mean to keep the Book, for I
suspect you are forming a curious collection, and I do not pretend to
any thing of the kind. I have not a Blackletter Book among mine, old
Chaucer excepted, and am not Bibliomanist enough to like Blackletter. It
is painful to read. Therefore I must insist on returning it at
opportunity, not from contumacity and reluctance to be oblig'd, but
because it must suit you better than me. The loss of a present <emphasis>from</emphasis>
should never exceed the gain of a present <emphasis>to</emphasis>. I hold this maxim
infallible in the accepting Line. I read your Magazines with
satisfaction. I throughly agree with you as to the German Faust, as far
[as] I can do justice to it from an English translation. 'Tis a
disagreeable canting tale of Seduction, which has nothing to do with the
Spirit of Faustus— Curiosity. Was the dark secret to be explored to end
in the seducing of a weak girl, which might have been accomplished by
earthly agency? When Marlow gives <emphasis>his</emphasis> Faustus a mistress, he flies him
at Helen, flower of Greece, to be sure, and not at Miss Betsy, or Miss
Sally Thoughtless.</p>
<p>        "Cut is the branch that bore the goodly fruit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And wither'd is Apollo's laurel tree:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Faustus is dead."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>What a noble natural transition from metaphor to plain speaking! as if
the figurative had flagged in description of such a Loss, and was
reduced to tell the fact simply.—</p>
<p>I must now thank you for your very kind invitation. It is not out of
prospect that I may see Manchester some day, and then I will avail
myself of your kindness. But Holydays are scarce things with me, and the
Laws of attendance are getting stronger and stronger at Leadenhall. But
I shall bear it in mind. Meantime something may (more probably) bring
you to town, where I shall be happy to see you. I am always to be found
(alas!) at my desk in the forepart of the day.</p>
<p>I wonder why they do not send the revise. I leave late at office, and my
abode lies out of the way, or I should have seen about it. If you are
impatient, Perhaps a Line to the Printer, directing him to send it me,
at Accountant's Office, may answer. You will see by the scrawl that I
only snatch a few minutes from intermitting Business.</p>

<p>My dear Sir—You talk of months at a time and I know not what
inducements to visit Manchester, Heaven knows how gratifying! but I have
had my little month of 1823 already. It is all over, and without
incurring a disagreeable favor I cannot so much as get a single holyday
till the season returns with the next year. Even our half-hour's
absences from office are set down in a Book! Next year, if I can spare a
day or two of it, I will come to Manchester, but I have reasons at home
against longer absences.—</p>
<p>I am so ill just at present—(an illness of my own procuring last night;
who is Perfect?)—that nothing but your very great kindness could make
me write. I will bear in mind the letter to W.W., you shall have it
quite in time, before the 12.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[January 9, 1824.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—Do you know what it is to succumb under an insurmountable day
mare—a whoreson lethargy, Falstaff calls it—an indisposition to do any
thing, or to be any thing—a total deadness and distaste—a suspension
of vitality —an indifference to locality—a numb soporifical
goodfornothingness—an ossification all over—an oyster-like
insensibility to the passing events—a mind-stupor,—a brawny defiance
to the needles of a thrusting-in conscience—did you ever have a very
bad cold, with a total irresolution to submit to water gruel
processes?—this has been for many weeks my lot, and my excuse—my
fingers drag heavily over this paper, and to my thinking it is three and
twenty furlongs from here to the end of this demi-sheet—I have not a
thing to say—nothing is of more importance than another—I am flatter
than a denial or a pancake—emptier than Judge Park's wig when the head
is in it—duller than a country stage when the actors are off it —a
cypher—an O—I acknowledge life at all, only by an occasional
convulsional cough, and a permanent phlegmatic pain in the chest—I am
weary of the world—Life is weary of me— My day is gone into Twilight
and I don't think it worth the expence of candles—my wick hath a thief
in it, but I can't muster courage to snuff it—I inhale suffocation—I
can't distinguish veal from mutton—nothing interests me—'tis 12
o'clock and Thurtell is just now coming out upon the New Drop—Jack
Ketch alertly tucking up his greasy sleeves to do the last office of
mortality, yet cannot I elicit a groan or a moral reflection— if you
told me the world will be at end tomorrow, I should just say, "will
it?"—I have not volition enough to dot my i's —much less to comb my
EYEBROWS—my eyes are set in my head—my brains are gone out to see a
poor relation in Moorfields, and they did not say when they'd come back
again— my scull is a Grub street Attic, to let—not so much as a joint
stool or a crackd jordan left in it—my hand writes, not I, from habit,
as chickens run about a little when their heads are off— O for a
vigorous fit of gout, cholic, tooth ache—an earwig in my auditory, a
fly in my visual organs—pain is life—the sharper, the more evidence of
life—but this apathy, this death—did you ever have an obstinate cold,
a six or seven weeks' unintermitting chill and suspension of hope, fear,
conscience, and every thing—yet do I try all I can to cure it, I try
wine, and spirits, and smoking, and snuff in unsparing quantities, but
they all only seem to make me worse, instead of better—I sleep in a
damp room, but it does me no good; I come home late o' nights, but do
not find any visible amendment.</p>
<p>Who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</p>
<p>It is just 15 minutes after 12. Thurtell is by this time a good way on
his journey, baiting at Scorpion perhaps, Ketch is bargaining for his
cast coat and waistcoat, the Jew demurs at first at three half crowns,
but on consideration that he, may get somewhat by showing 'em in the
Town, finally closes.—</p>

<p>LETTER 340</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. January 23, 1824.]</p>
<p>My dear Sir—That peevish letter of mine, which was meant to convey an
apology for my incapacity to write, seems to have been taken by you in
too serious a light. It was only my way of telling you I had a severe
cold. The fact is I have been insuperably dull and lethargic for many
weeks, and cannot rise to the vigour of a Letter, much less an Essay.
The London must do without me for a time, a time, and half a time, for I
have lost all interest about it, and whether I shall recover it again I
know not. I will bridle my pen another time, &amp; not teaze and puzzle you
with my aridities. I shall begin to feel a little more alive with the
spring. Winter is to me (mild or harsh) always a great trial of the
spirits. I am ashamed not to have noticed your tribute to Woolman, whom
we love so much. It is done in your good manner. Your friend Taylor
called upon me some time since, and seems a very amiable man. His last
story is painfully fine. His Book I "like." It is only too stuft with
scripture, too Parsonish. The best thing in it is the Boy's own story.
When I say it is too full of Scripture, I mean it is too full of direct
quotations; no book can have too much of SILENT SCRIPTURE in it. But the
natural power of a story is diminished when the uppermost purpose in the
writer seems to be to recommend something else, viz Religion. You know
what Horace says of the DEUS INTERSIT. I am not able to explain myself,
you must do it for me.—</p>
<p>My Sister's part in the Leicester School (about two thirds) was purely
her own; as it was (to the same quantity) in the Shakspeare Tales which
bear my name. I wrote only the Witch Aunt, the first going to Church,
and the final Story about a little Indian girl in a Ship.</p>
<p>Your account of my Black Balling amused me. <emphasis>I think, as Quakers, they
did right</emphasis>. There are some things hard to be understood.</p>
<p>The more I think the more I am vexed at having puzzled you with that
Letter, but I have been so out of Letter writing of late years, that it
is a sore effort to sit down to it, &amp; I felt in your debt, and sat down
waywardly to pay you in bad money. Never mind my dulness, I am used to
long intervals of it. The heavens seem brass to me—then again comes the
refreshing shower. "I have been merry once or twice ere now."</p>
<p>You said something about Mr. Mitford in a late letter, which I believe I
did not advert to. I shall be happy to show him my Milton (it is all the
show things I have) at any time he will take the trouble of a jaunt to
Islington. I do also hope to see Mr. Taylor there some day. Pray say so
to both.</p>

<p>Do you trouble yourself about Libel cases? The Decision against Hunt for
the "Vision of Judgment" made me sick. What is to become of the old talk
about OUR GOOD OLD KING —his personal virtues saving us from a
revolution &amp;c. &amp;c. Why, none that think it can utter it now. It must
stink. And the Vision is really, as to Him-ward, such a tolerant good
humour'd thing. What a wretched thing a Lord Chief Justice is, always
was, &amp; will be!</p>
<p>Keep your good spirits up, dear BB—mine will return—They are at
present in abeyance. But I am rather lethargic than miserable. I don't
know but a good horse whip would be more beneficial to me than Physic.
My head, without aching, will teach yours to ache. It is well I am
getting to the conclusion. I will send a better letter when I am a
better man. Let me thank you for your kind concern for me (which I trust
will have reason soon to be dissipated) &amp; assure you that it gives me
pleasure to hear from you.—</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. February 25, 1824.]</p>
<p>My dear Sir—Your title of Poetic Vigils arrides me much more than A
Volume of Verse, which is no meaning. The motto says nothing, but I
cannot suggest a better. I do not like mottoes but where they are
singularly felicitous; there is foppery in them. They are unplain,
un-Quakerish. They are good only where they flow from the Title and are
a kind of justification of it. There is nothing about watchings or
lucubrations in the one you suggest, no commentary on Vigils. By the
way, a wag would recommend you to the Line of Pope</p>
<p>        Sleepless himself—to give his readers sleep—</p>
<p>I by no means wish it. But it may explain what I mean, that a neat motto
is child of the Title. I think Poetic Virgils as short and sweet as can
be desired; only have an eye on the Proof, that the Printer do not
substitute Virgils, which would ill accord with your modesty or meaning.
Your suggested motto is antique enough in spelling, and modern enough in
phrases; a good modern antique: but the matter of it is germane to the
purpose only supposing the title proposed a vindication of yourself from
the presumption of authorship. The 1st title was liable to this
objection, that if you were disposed to enlarge it, and the bookseller
insisted on its appearance in Two Tomes, how oddly it would sound—</p>
<p>            A Volume of Verse
            in Two Volumes
            2d edition &amp;c—</p>
<p>You see thro' my wicked intention of curtailing this Epistolet by the
above device of large margin. But in truth the idea of letterising has
been oppressive to me of late above your candour to give me credit for.
There is Southey, whom I ought to have thank'd a fortnight ago for a
present of the Church Book. I have never had courage to buckle myself in
earnest even to acknowledge it by six words. And yet I am accounted by
some people a good man. How cheap that character is acquired! Pay your
debts, don't borrow money, nor twist your kittens neck off, or disturb a
congregation, &amp;c.— your business is done. I know things (thoughts or
things, thoughts are things) of myself which would make every friend I
have fly me as a plague patient. I once * * *, and set a dog upon a
crab's leg that was shoved out under a moss of sea weeds, a pretty
little feeler.—Oh! pah! how sick I am of that; and a lie, a mean one, I
once told!— I stink in the midst of respect.</p>
<p>I am much hypt; the fact is, my head is heavy, but there is hope, or if
not, I am better than a poor shell fish—not morally when I set the
whelp upon it, but have more blood and spirits; things may turn up, and
I may creep again into a decent opinion of myself. Vanity will return
with sunshine. Till when, pardon my neglects and impute it to the wintry
solstice.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. 24 March, 1824.]</p>
<p>DEAR B.B.—I hasten to say that if my opinion can strengthen you in your
choice, it is decisive for your acceptance of what has been so
handsomely offered. I can see nothing injurious to your most honourable
sense. Think that you are called to a poetical Ministry—nothing
worse—the Minister is worthy of the hire.</p>
<p>The only objection I feel is founded on a fear that the acceptance may
be a temptation to you to let fall the bone (hard as it is) which is in
your mouth and must afford tolerable pickings, for the shadow of
independence. You cannot propose to become independent on what the low
state of interest could afford you from such a principal as you mention;
and the most graceful excuse for the acceptance, would be, that it left
you free to your voluntary functions. That is the less <emphasis>light</emphasis> part of
the scruple. It has no darker shade. I put in <emphasis>darker</emphasis>, because of the
ambiguity of the word light, which Donne in his admirable poem on the
Metempsychosis, has so ingeniously illustrated in his invocation</p>
<p>             1    2                  1                2
Make my <emphasis>dark heavy</emphasis> poem, <emphasis>light</emphasis> and <emphasis>light</emphasis>—</p>
<p>where the two senses of <emphasis>light</emphasis> are opposed to different opposites. A
trifling criticism.—I can see no reason for any scruple then but what
arises from your own interest; which is in your own power of course to
solve. If you still have doubts, read over Sanderson's Cases of
Conscience, and Jeremy Taylor's Ductor Dubitantium, the first a moderate
Octavo, the latter a folio of 900 close pages, and when you have
thoroughly digested the admirable reasons pro and con which they give
for every possible Case, you will be—just as wise as when you began.
Every man is his own best Casuist; and after all, as Ephraim Smooth, in
the pleasant comedy of Wild Oats, has it, "there is no harm in a
Guinea." A fortiori there is less in 2000.</p>
<p>I therefore most sincerely congratulate with you, excepting so far as
excepted above. If you have fair Prospects of adding to the Principal,
cut the Bank; but in either case do not refuse an honest Service. Your
heart tells you it is not offered to bribe you <emphasis>from</emphasis> any duty, but
<emphasis>to</emphasis>
a duty which you feel to be your vocation. Farewell heartily C.L.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[In the memoir of Barton by Edward FitzGerald, prefixed to the <emphasis>Poems
and Letters</emphasis>, it is stated that in this year Barton received a handsome
addition to his income. "A few members of his Society, including some of
the wealthier of his own family, raised £1200 among them for his benefit
[not 2000 guineas, as Lamb says]. It seems that he felt some delicacy at
first in accepting this munificent testimony which his own people
offered to his talents." Birton had written to Lamb on the subject.]</p>

<p>I am sure I cannot fill a letter, though I should disfurnish my scull to
fill it. But you expect something, and shall have a Note-let. Is Sunday,
not divinely speaking, but humanly and holydaysically, a blessing?
Without its institution, would our rugged taskmasters have given us a
leisure day, so often, think you, as once in a month?—or, if it had not
been instituted, might they not have given us every 6th day? Solve me
this problem. If we are to go 3 times a day to church, why has Sunday
slipped into the notion of a _Holli_day? A Holyday I grant it. The
puritans, I have read in Southey's Book, knew the distinction. They made
people observe Sunday rigorously, would not let a nursery maid walk out
in the fields with children for recreation on that day. But <emphasis>then</emphasis>—they
gave the people a holliday from all sorts of work every second Tuesday.
This was giving to the Two Caesars that which was <emphasis>his</emphasis> respective.

<p>I am sitting opposite a person who is making strange distortions with
the gout, which is not unpleasant—to me at least. What is the reason we
do not sympathise with pain, short of some terrible Surgical operation?
Hazlitt, who boldly says all he feels, avows that not only he does not
pity sick people, but he hates them. I obscurely recognise his meaning.
Pain is probably too selfish a consideration, too simply a consideration
of self-attention. We pity poverty, loss of friends etc. more complex
things, in which the Sufferers feelings are associated with others. This
is a rough thought suggested by the presence of gout; I want head to
extricate it and plane it. What is all this to your Letter? I felt it to
be a good one, but my turn, when I write at all, is perversely to travel
out of the record, so that my letters are any thing but answers. So you
still want a motto? You must not take my ironical one, because your
book, I take it, is too serious for it. Bickerstaff might have used it
for <emphasis>his</emphasis> lucubrations. What do you think of (for a Title)</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>May 15, 1824.</p>
<p>DEAR B.B.—I am oppressed with business all day, and Company all night.
But I will snatch a quarter of an hour. Your recent acquisitions of the
Picture and the Letter are greatly to be congratulated. I too have a
picture of my father and the copy of his first love verses; but they
have been mine long. Blake is a real name, I assure you, and a most
extraordinary man, if he be still living. He is the Robert [William]
Blake, whose wild designs accompany a splendid folio edition of the
"Night Thoughts," which you may have seen, in one of which he pictures
the parting of soul and body by a solid mass of human form floating off,
God knows how, from a lumpish mass (fac Simile to itself) left behind on
the dying bed. He paints in water colours marvellous strange pictures,
visions of his brain, which he asserts that he has seen. They have great
merit. He has <emphasis>seen</emphasis> the old Welsh bards on Snowdon—he has seen the
Beautifullest, the strongest, and the Ugliest Man, left alone from the
Massacre of the Britons by the Romans, and has painted them from memory
(I have seen his paintings), and asserts them to be as good as the
figures of Raphael and Angelo, but not better, as they had precisely the
same retro-visions and prophetic visions with themself [himself]. The
painters in oil (which he will have it that neither of them practised)
he affirms to have been the ruin of art, and affirms that all the while
he was engaged in his Water paintings, Titian was disturbing him, Titian
the III Genius of Oil Painting. His Pictures—one in particular, the
Canterbury Pilgrims (far above Stothard's)—have great merit, but hard,
dry, yet with grace. He has written a Catalogue of them with a most
spirited criticism on Chaucer, but mystical and full of Vision. His
poems have been sold hitherto only in Manuscript. I never read them; but
a friend at my desire procured the "Sweep Song." There is one to a
tiger, which I have heard recited, beginning—</p>
<p>            "Tiger, Tiger, burning bright,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Thro' the desarts of the night,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>which is glorious, but, alas! I have not the book; for the man is flown,
whither I know not—to Hades or a Mad House. But I must look on him as
one of the most extraordinary persons of the age. Montgomery's book I
have not much hope from. The Society, with the affected name, has been
labouring at it for these 20 years, and made few converts. I think it
was injudicious to mix stories avowedly colour'd by fiction with the sad
true statements from the parliamentary records, etc., but I wish the
little Negroes all the good that can come from it. I batter'd my brains
(not butter'd them—but it is a bad <emphasis>a</emphasis>) for a few verses for them, but
I could make nothing of it. You have been luckier. But Blake's are the
flower of the set, you will, I am sure, agree, tho' some of Montgomery's
at the end are pretty; but the Dream awkwardly paraphras'd from B.</p>
<p>With the exception of an Epilogue for a Private Theatrical, I have
written nothing now for near 6 months. It is in vain to spur me on. I
must wait. I cannot write without a genial impulse, and I have none.
'Tis barren all and dearth. No matter; life is something without
scribbling. I have got rid of my bad spirits, and hold up pretty well
this rain-damn'd May.</p>
<p>So we have lost another Poet. I never much relished his Lordship's mind,
and shall be sorry if the Greeks have cause to miss him. He was to me
offensive, and I never can make out his great <emphasis>power</emphasis>, which his
admirers talk of. Why, a line of Wordsworth's is a lever to lift the
immortal spirit! Byron can only move the Spleen. He was at best a
Satyrist,—in any other way he was mean enough. I dare say I do him
injustice; but I cannot love him, nor squeeze a tear to his memory. He
did not like the world, and he has left it, as Alderman Curtis advised
the Radicals, "If they don't like their country, damn 'em, let 'em leave
it," they possessing no rood of ground in England, and he 10,000 acres.
Byron was better than many Curtises.</p>
<p>Farewell, and accept this apology for a letter from one who owes you so
much in that kind.</p>
<p>                      Yours ever truly,                     C.L.</p>

<p>[Lamb's portrait of his father is reproduced in Vol. II. of my large
edition. The first love verses are no more.</p>
<p>William Blake was at this time sixty-six years of age. He was living in
poverty and neglect at 3 Fountain Court, Strand. Blake made 537
illustrations to Young's <emphasis>Night Thoughts</emphasis>, of which only forty-seven
were published. Lamb is, however, thinking of his edition of Blair's
<emphasis>Grave</emphasis>. The exhibition of his works was held in 1809, and it was for
this that Blake wrote the descriptive catalogue. Lamb had sent Blake's
"Sweep Song," which, like "Tiger, Tiger," is in the <emphasis>Songs of
Innocence</emphasis>, to James Montgomery for his <emphasis>Chimney-Sweepers' Friend and
Climbing Boys' Album</emphasis>, 1824, a little book designed to ameliorate the
lot of those children, in whose interest a society existed. Barton also
contributed something. It was Blake's poem which had excited Barton's
curiosity. Probably he thought that Lamb wrote it. Lamb's mistake
concerning Blake's name is curious in so far as that it was Blake's
brother Robert, who died in 1787, who in a vision revealed to the poet
the method by which the <emphasis>Songs of Innocence</emphasis> were to be reproduced.</p>
<p>"The Dream awkwardly paraphras'd from B." The book ended with three
"Climbing-Boys' Soliloquies" by Montgomery. The second was a dream in
which the dream in Blake's song was extended and prosified.</p>
<p>"An Epilogue for a Private Theatrical." Probably the epilogue for the
amateur performance of "Richard II.," given by the family of Henry
Field, Barren Field's father (see Vol. IV. of the present edition).</p>
<p>"Another great Poet." Byron died on April 19, 1824.</p>

<p>LETTER 347</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>July 7th, 1824.</p>
<p>DEAR B.B.—I have been suffering under a severe inflammation of the
eyes, notwithstanding which I resolutely went through your very pretty
volume at once, which I dare pronounce in no ways inferior to former
lucubrations. "<emphasis>Abroad</emphasis>" and "<emphasis>lord</emphasis>" are vile rhymes notwithstanding,
and if you count you will wonder how many times you have repeated the
word <emphasis>unearthly</emphasis>—thrice in one poem. It is become a slang word with the
bards; avoid it in future lustily. "Time" is fine; but there are better
a good deal, I think. The volume does not lie by me; and, after a long
day's smarting fatigue, which has almost put out my eyes (not blind
however to your merits), I dare not trust myself with long writing. The
verses to Bloomfield are the sweetest in the collection. Religion is
sometimes lugged in, as if it did not come naturally. I will go over
carefully when I get my seeing, and exemplify. You have also too much of
singing metre, such as requires no deep ear to make; lilting measure, in
which you have done Woolman injustice. Strike at less superficial
melodies. The piece on Nayler is more to my fancy.</p>
<p>My eye runs waters. But I will give you a fuller account some day. The
book is a very pretty one in more than one sense. The decorative harp,
perhaps, too ostentatious; a simple pipe preferable.</p>
<p>Farewell, and many thanks.                   C. LAMB.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Barton's new book was <emphasis>Poetic Vigils</emphasis>, 1824. It contained among other
poems "An Ode to Time," "Verses to the Memory of Bloomfield," "A

<p>Dear Marter,—I have just rec'd your letter, having returned from a
month's holydays. My exertions for the London are, tho' not dead, in a
dead sleep for the present. If your club like scandal, Blackwood's is
your magazine; if you prefer light articles, and humorous without
offence, the New Monthly is very amusing. The best of it is by Horace
Smith, the author of the Rejected Addresses. The Old Monthly has more of
matter, information, but not so merry. I cannot safely recommend any
others, as not knowing them, or knowing them to their disadvantage. Of
Reviews, beside what you mention, I know of none except the Review on
Hounslow Heath, which I take it is too expensive for your ordering. Pity
me, that have been a Gentleman these four weeks, and am reduced in one
day to the state of a ready writer. I feel, I feel, my gentlemanly
qualities fast oozing away—such as a sense of honour, neckcloths twice
a day, abstinence from swearing, &amp;c. The desk enters into my soul.</p>

<p>My dear Sir—I must appear negligent in not having thanked you for the
very pleasant books you sent me. Arthur, and the Novel, we have both of
us read with unmixed satisfaction. They are full of quaint conceits, and
running over with good humour and good nature. I naturally take little
interest in story, but in these the manner and not the end is the
interest; it is such pleasant travelling, one scarce cares whither it
leads us. Pray express our pleasure to your father with my best thanks.</p>

<p>And what dost thou at the Priory? <emphasis>Cucullus non facit Monachum</emphasis>. English
me that, and challenge old Lignum Janua to make a better.</p>
<p>My old New River has presented no extraordinary novelties lately; but
there Hope sits every day, speculating upon traditionary gudgeons. I
think she has taken the fisheries. I now know the reason why our
forefathers were denominated East and West Angles. Yet is there no lack
of spawn; for I wash my hands in fishets that come through the pump
every morning thick as motelings,—little things o o o like <emphasis>that</emphasis>, that
perish untimely, and never taste the brook. You do not tell me of those
romantic land bays that be as thou goest to Lover's Seat: neither of
that little churchling in the midst of a wood (in the opposite
direction, nine furlongs from the town), that seems dropped by the Angel
that was tired of carrying two packages; marry, with the other he made
shift to pick his flight to Loretto. Inquire out, and see my little
Protestant Loretto. It stands apart from trace of human habitation; yet
hath it pulpit, reading-desk, and trim front of massiest marble, as if
Robinson Crusoe had reared it to soothe himself with old church-going
images. I forget its Christian name, and what she-saint was its gossip.</p>
<p>You should also go to No. 13, Standgate Street,—a baker, who has the
finest collection of marine monsters in ten sea counties,—sea dragons,
polypi, mer-people, most fantastic. You have only to name the old
gentleman in black (not the Devil) that lodged with him a week (he'll
remember) last July, and he will show courtesy. He is by far the
foremost of the savans. His wife is the funniest thwarting little
animal! They are decidedly the Lions of green Hastings. Well, I have
made an end of my say. My epistolary time is gone by when I could have
scribbled as long (I will not say as agreeable) as thine was to both of
us. I am dwindled to notes and letterets. But, in good earnest, I shall
be most happy to hail thy return to the waters of Old Sir Hugh. There is
nothing like inland murmurs, fresh ripples, and our native minnows.</p>

<p>            With a sweet inland murmur.</p>
<p>In the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "The Old Margate Hoy" Lamb, in speaking of Hastings,
had made the same objection.</p>
<p>In a letter to his sister, written from Hastings at this time, Hood
says:—</p>
<p>    This is the last of our excursions. We have tried, but in vain, to
    find out the baker and his wife recommended to us by Lamb as the
    very lions of green Hastings. There is no such street as he has
    named throughout the town, and the ovens are singularly numerous. We
    have given up the search, therefore, but we have discovered the
    little church in the wood, and it is such a church! It ought to have
    been our St. Botolph's. … Such a verdant covert wood Stothard
    might paint for the haunting of Dioneus, Pamphillus, and Fiammetta
    as they walk in the novel of Boccacce. The ground shadowed with
    bluebells, even to the formation of a plumb-like bloom upon its
    little knolls and ridges; and ever through the dell windeth a little
    path chequered with the shades of aspens and ashes and the most
    verdant and lively of all the family of trees. Here a broad, rude
    stone steppeth over a lazy spring, oozing its way into grass and
    weeds; anon a fresh pathway divergeth, you know not whither.
    Meanwhile the wild blackbird startles across the way and singeth
    anew in some other shade. To have seen Fiammetta there, stepping in
    silk attire, like a flower, and the sunlight looking upon her
    betwixt the branches! I had not walked (in the body) with Romance
    before. Then suppose so much of a space cleared as maketh a small
    church <emphasis>lawn</emphasis> to be sprinkled with old gravestones, and in the midst
    the church itself, a small Christian dovecot, such as Lamb has truly
    described it, like a little temple of Juan Fernandes. I could have
    been sentimental and wished to lie some day in that place, its calm
    tenants seeming to come through such quiet ways, through those
    verdant alleys, to their graves.</p>
<p>    In coming home I killed a viper in our serpentine path, and Mrs.
    Fernor says I am by that token to overcome an enemy. Is Taylor or
    Hessey dead? The reptile was dark and dull, his blood being yet
    sluggish from the cold; howbeit, he tried to bite, till I cut him in
    two with a stone. I thought of Hessey's long back-bone when I did
    it.</p>

<p>LETTER 351</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. August 17, 1824.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I congratulate you on getting a house over your head. I find
the comfort of it I am sure. At my town lodgings the Mistress was always
quarrelling with our maid; and at my place of rustication, the whole
family were always beating one another, brothers beating sisters (one a
most beautiful girl lamed for life), father beating sons and daughters,
and son again beating his father, knocking him fairly down, a scene I
never before witnessed, but was called out of bed by the unnatural
blows, the parricidal colour of which, tho' my morals could not but
condemn, yet my reason did heartily approve, and in the issue the house
was quieter for a day or so than I had ever known. I am now all harmony
and quiet, even to the sometimes wishing back again some of the old
rufflings. There is something stirring in these civil broils.</p>
<p>The Album shall be attended to. If I can light upon a few appropriate
rhymes (but rhymes come with difficulty from me now) I shall beg a place
in the neat margin of your young housekeeper.</p>
<p>The Prometheus Unbound, is a capital story. The Literal rogue! What if
you had ordered Elfrida in <emphasis>sheets!</emphasis> She'd have been sent up, I warrant
you. Or bid him clasp his bible (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis> to his bosom)-he'd ha clapt on a
brass clasp, no doubt.—</p>
<p>I can no more understand Shelly than you can. His poetry is "thin sewn
with profit or delight." Yet I must point to your notice a sonnet
conceivd and expressed with a witty delicacy. It is that addressed to
one who hated him, but who could not persuade him to hate <emphasis>him</emphasis> again.
His coyness to the other's passion (for hate demands a return as much as
Love, and starves without it) is most arch and pleasant. Pray, like it
very much.</p>
<p>For his theories and nostrums they are oracular enough, but I either
comprehend 'em not, or there is miching malice and mischief in 'em. But
for the most part ringing with their own emptiness. Hazlitt said well of
'em—Many are wiser and better for reading Shakspeare, but nobody was
ever wiser or better for reading Sh——y.</p>
<p>I wonder you will sow your correspondence on so barren a ground as I am,
that make such poor returns. But my head akes at the bare thought of
letter writing. I wish all the ink in the ocean dried up, and would
listen to the quills shivering [? shrivelling] up in the candle flame,
like parching martyrs. The same indisposit'n to write it is has stopt my
Elias, but you will see a futile Effort in the next No., "wrung from me
with slow pain."</p>
<p>The fact is, my head is seldom cool enough. I am dreadfully indolent. To
have to do anything-to order me a new coat, for instance, tho' my old
buttons are shelled like beans— is an effort.</p>
<p>My pen stammers like my tongue. What cool craniums
those old enditers of Folios must have had. What a mortify'd
pulse. Well, once more I throw myself on your mercy—
Wishing peace in thy new dwelling—                 C. LAMB.</p>

<p>Dear B.B.—"I am ill at these numbers;" but if the above be not too
mean to have a place in thy Daughter's Sanctum, take them with pleasure.
I assume that her Name is Hannah, because it is a pretty scriptural
cognomen. I began on another sheet of paper, and just as I had penn'd
the second line of Stanza 2 an ugly Blot [<emphasis>here is a blot</emphasis>] as big as
this, fell, to illustrate my counsel.—I am sadly given to blot, and
modern blotting-paper gives no redress; it only smears and makes it
worse, as for example [<emphasis>here is a smear</emphasis>]. The only remedy is scratching
out, which gives it a Clerkish look. The most innocent blots are made
with red ink, and are rather ornamental. [<emphasis>Here are two or three blots
in red ink.</emphasis>] Marry, they are not always to be distinguished from the
effusions of a cut finger.</p>
<p>Well, I hope and trust thy Tick doleru, or however you spell it, is
vanished, for I have frightful impressions of that Tick, and do
altogether hate it, as an unpaid score, or the Tick of a Death Watch. I
take it to be a species of Vitus's dance (I omit the Sanctity, writing
to "one of the men called Friends"). I knew a young Lady who could dance
no other, she danced thro' life, and very queer and fantastic were her
steps. Heaven bless thee from such measures, and keep thee from the Foul
Fiend, who delights to lead after False Fires in the night,
Flibbertigibit, that gives the web and the pin &amp;c. I forget what else.—</p>

<p>Dear Mrs. Collier—We receive so much pig from your kindness, that I
really have not phrase enough to vary successive acknowledg'mts.</p>
<p>I think I shall get a printed form: to serve on all occasions.</p>
<p>To say it was young, crisp, short, luscious, dainty-toed, is but to say
what all its predecessors have been. It was eaten on Sunday and Monday,
and doubts only exist as to which temperature it eat best, hot or cold.
I incline to the latter. The Petty-feet made a pretty surprising
proe-gustation for supper on Saturday night, just as I was loathingly in

<p>I do not know what news to send you. You will have heard of Alsager's
death, and your Son John's success in the Lottery. I say he is a wise
man, if he leaves off while he is well. The weather is wet to weariness,
but Mary goes puddling about a-shopping after a gown for the winter. She
wants it good &amp; cheap. Now I hold that no good things are cheap,
pig-presents always excepted. In this mournful weather I sit moping,
where I now write, in an office dark as Erebus, jammed in between 4
walls, and writing by Candle-light, most melancholy. Never see the light
of the Sun six hours in the day, and am surprised to find how pretty it
shines on Sundays. I wish I were a Caravan driver or a Penny post man,
to earn my bread in air &amp; sunshine. Such a pedestrian as I am, to be
tied by the legs, like a Fauntleroy, without the pleasure of his
Exactions. I am interrupted here with an official question, which will
take me up till it's time to go to dinner, so with repeated thanks &amp;
both our kindest rememb'ces to Mr. Collier &amp; yourself, I conclude in

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.W. PROCTER</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: November 11, '24.]</p>
<p>My dear Procter,—</p>
<p>I do agnise a shame in not having been to pay my congratulations to Mrs.
Procter and your happy self, but on Sunday (my only morning) I was
engaged to a country walk; and in virtue of the hypostatical union
between us, when Mary calls, it is understood that I call too, we being
univocal.</p>
<p>But indeed I am ill at these ceremonious inductions. I fancy I was not
born with a call on my head, though I have brought one down upon it with
a vengeance. I love not to pluck that sort of fruit crude, but to stay
its ripening into visits. In probability Mary will be at Southampton Row
this morning, and something of that kind be matured between you, but in
any case not many hours shall elapse before I shake you by the hand.</p>
<p>Meantime give my kindest felicitations to Mrs. Procter, and assure her I
look forward with the greatest delight to our acquaintance. By the way,
the deuce a bit of Cake has come to hand, which hath an inauspicious
look at first, but I comfort myself that that Mysterious Service hath
the property of Sacramental Bread, which mice cannot nibble, nor time
moulder.</p>
<p>I am married myself—to a severe step-wife, who keeps me, not at bed and
board, but at desk and board, and is jealous of my morning aberrations.
I can not slip out to congratulate kinder unions. It is well she leaves
me alone o' nights—the damn'd Day-hag <emphasis>BUSINESS</emphasis>. She is even now
peeping over me to see I am writing no Love Letters. I come, my dear—
Where is the Indigo Sale Book?</p>
<p>Twenty adieus, my dear friends, till we meet.</p>
<p>                            Yours most truly,           C. LAMB.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SARAH HUTCHINSON</strong></p>
<p>Desk II, Nov. 25 [1824].</p>
<p>My dear Miss Hutchinson, Mary bids me thank you for your kind letter. We
are a little puzzled about your where-abouts: Miss Wordsworth writes
Torkay, and you have queerly made it Torquay. Now Tokay we have heard
of, and Torbay, which we take to be the true <emphasis>male</emphasis> spelling of the
place, but somewhere we fancy it to be on "Devon's leafy shores," where
we heartily wish the kindly breezes may restore all that is invalid
among you. Robinson is returned, and speaks much of you all. We shall be
most glad to hear good news from you from time to time. The best is,
Proctor is at last married. We have made sundry attempts to see the
Bride, but have accidentally failed, she being gone out a gadding.</p>
<p>We had promised our dear friends the Monkhouses, promised ourselves
rather, a visit to them at Ramsgate, but I thought it best, and Mary
seemed to have it at heart too, not to go far from home these last holy
days. It is connected with a sense of unsettlement, and secretly I know
she hoped that such abstinence would be friendly to her health. She
certainly has escaped her sad yearly visitation, whether in consequence
of it, or of faith in it, and we have to be thankful for a good 1824. To
get such a notion into our heads may go a great way another year. Not
that we quite confined ourselves; but assuming Islington to be head
quarters, we made timid flights to Ware, Watford &amp;c. to try how the
trouts tasted, for a night out or so, not long enough to make the sense
of change oppressive, but sufficient to scour the rust of home.</p>
<p>Coleridge is not returned from the Sea. As a little scandal
may divert you recluses—we were in the Summer dining at a
Clergyman of Southey's "Church of England," at Hertford,
the same who officiated to Thurtell's last moments, and indeed
an old contemporary Blue of C.'s and mine at School. After
dinner we talked of C., and F. who is a mighty good fellow in
the main, but hath his cassock prejudices, inveighed against
the moral character of C. I endeavoured to enlighten him on
the subject, till having driven him out of some of his holds, he
stopt my mouth at once by appealing to me whether it was not
very well known that C. "at that very moment was living in
a state of open a———y with Mrs. * * * * * at Highgate?"
Nothing I could say serious or bantering after that
could remove the deep inrooted conviction of the whole company
assembled that such was the case! Of course you will
keep this quite close, for I would not involve my poor blundering
friend, who I dare say believed it all thoroughly. My
interference of course was imputed to the goodness of my heart,
that could imagine nothing wrong &amp;c. Such it is if Ladies
will go gadding about with other people's husbands at watering
places. How careful we should be to avoid the appearance of
Evil. I thought this Anecdote might amuse you. It is not
worth resenting seriously; only I give it as a specimen of
orthodox candour. O Southey, Southey, how long would it
be before you would find one of us <emphasis>Unitarians</emphasis> propagating
such unwarrantable Scandal! Providence keep you all from
the foul fiend Scandal, and send you back well and happy to
dear Gloster Place.                    C.L.</p>

<p>LETTER 357</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO LEIGH HUNT</strong></p>
<p>[No date. ? November, 1824.]</p>
<p>ILLUSTREZZIMO Signor,—I have obeyed your mandate to a tittle. I
accompany this with a volume. But what have you done with the first I
sent you?—have you swapt it with some lazzaroni for macaroni? or
pledged it with a gondolierer for a passage? Peradventuri the Cardinal
Gonsalvi took a fancy to it:—his Eminence has done my Nearness an
honour. 'Tis but a step to the Vatican. As you judge, my works do not
enrich the workman, but I get vat I can for 'em. They keep dragging me
on, a poor, worn mill-horse, in the eternal round of the damn'd
magazine; but 'tis they are blind, not I. Colburn (where I recognise
with delight the gay W. Honeycomb renovated) hath the ascendency.</p>
<p>I was with the Novellos last week. They have a large, cheap house and
garden, with a dainty library (magnificent) without books. But what will
make you bless yourself (I am too old for wonder), something has touched
the right organ in Vincentio at last. He attends a Wesleyan chapel on
Kingsland Green. He at first tried to laugh it off—he only went for the
singing; but the cloven foot—I retract—the Lamb's trotters—are at
length apparent. Mary Isabella attributes it to a lightness induced by
his headaches. But I think I see in it a less accidental influence.
Mister Clark is at perfect staggers! the whole fabric of his infidelity
is shaken. He has no one to join him in his coarse-insults and indecent
obstreperousnesses against Christianity, for Holmes (the bonny Holmes)
is gone to Salisbury to be organist, and Isabella and the Clark make but
a feeble quorum. The children have all nice, neat little clasped
pray-books, and I have laid out 7s. 8d. in Watts's Hymns for Christmas
presents for them. The eldest girl alone holds out; she has been at
Boulogne, skirting upon the vast focus of Atheism, and imported bad
principles in patois French. But the strongholds are crumbling. N.
appears as yet to have but a confused notion of the Atonement. It makes
him giddy, he says, to think much about it. But such giddiness is
spiritual sobriety.</p>
<p>Well, Byron is gone, and ——— is now the best poet in England. Fill up
the gap to your fancy. Barry Cornwall has at last carried the pretty A.
S. They are just in the treacle-moon. Hope it won't clog his wings—gaum
we used to say at school.</p>
<p>Mary, my sister, has worn me out with eight weeks' cold and toothache,
her average complement in the winter, and it will not go away. She is
otherwise well, and reads novels all day long. She has had an exempt
year, a good year, for which, forgetting the minor calamity, she and I
are most thankful.</p>
<p>Alsager is in a flourishing house, with wife and children about him, in</p>
<empty-line/>

Mecklenburg Square—almost too fine to visit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Barron Field is come home from Sydney, but as yet I can hear no tidings
of a pension. He is plump and friendly, his wife really a very superior
woman. He resumes the bar.</p>
<p>I have got acquainted with Mr. Irving, the Scotch preacher, whose fame
must have reached you. He is a humble disciple at the foot of Gamaliel
S.T.C. Judge how his own sectarists must stare when I tell you he has
dedicated a book to S.T.C., acknowledging to have learnt more of the
nature of Faith, Christianity, and Christian Church, from him than from
all the men he ever conversed with. He is a most amiable, sincere,
modest man in a room, this Boanerges in the temple. Mrs. Montague told
him the dedication would do him no good. "That shall be a reason for
doing it," was his answer. Judge, now, whether this man be a quack.</p>
<p>Dear H., take this imperfect notelet for a letter; it looks so much the
more like conversing on nearer terms. Love to all the Hunts, old friend
Thornton, and all.</p>
<p>                            Yours ever,                C. LAMB.</p>

<p>[Leigh Hunt was still living at Genoa. Shelley and Byron, whom he had
left England to join, were both dead. Lamb, I assume, sent him a second
copy of <emphasis>Elia</emphasis>, with this letter.</p>

<p>For the present state of the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> see next letter. Leigh
Hunt contributed to Colburn's <emphasis>New Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, among other
things, a series of papers on "The Months." Hunt also contributed an
account of the Honeycomb family, by Harry Honeycomb.</p>
<p>By Mary Isabella Lamb meant Mary Sabilla Novello, Vincent Novello's
wife. The eldest girl was Mary Victoria, afterwards the wife of Charles
Cowden Clarke, the Mr. Clark mentioned here. Novello (now living at
Shackleford Green) remained a good Roman Catholic to the end. Holmes was
Edward Holmes (1797-1859), a pupil of Cowden Clarke's father at Enfield
and schoolfellow of Keats. He had lived with the Novellos, studying
music, and later became a musical writer and teacher and the biographer
of Mozart.</p>
<p>Mrs. Barron Field was a Miss Jane Carncroft, to whom Lamb addressed some
album verses (see Vol. IV. of this edition). Leigh Hunt knew of Field's
return, for he had contributed to the <emphasis>New Monthly</emphasis> earlier in the year
a rhymed letter to him in which he welcomed him home again.</p>
<p>Irving was Edward Irving (1792-1834), afterwards the founder of the
Catholic Apostolic sect, then drawing people to the chapel in Hatton
Garden, attached to the Caledonian Asylum. The dedication, to which Lamb
alludes more than once in his correspondence, was that of his work, <emphasis>For

parts</emphasis>, … 1825. It runs:—</p>

<p><strong>DEDICATION</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TO</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>SAMUEL TAYLOR COLERIDGE, ESQ.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MY DEAR AND HONOURED FRIEND,</strong></p>
<p>Unknown as you are, in the true character either of your mind or of your
heart, to the greater part of your countrymen, and misrepresented as
your works have been, by those who have the ear of the vulgar, it will
seem wonderful to many that I should make choice of you, from the circle
of my friends, to dedicate to you these beginnings of my thoughts upon
the most important subject of these or any times. And when I state the
reason to be, that you have been more profitable to my faith in orthodox
doctrine, to my spiritual understanding of the Word of God, and to my
right conception of the Christian Church, than any or all of the men
with whom I have entertained friendship and conversation, it will
perhaps still more astonish the mind, and stagger the belief, of those
who have adopted, as once I did myself, the misrepresentations which are
purchased for a hire and vended for a price, concerning your character
and works. You have only to shut your ear to what they ignorantly say of
you, and earnestly to meditate the deep thoughts with which you are
instinct, and give them a suitable body and form that they may live,
then silently commit them to the good sense of ages yet to come, in
order to be ranked hereafter amongst the most gifted sages and greatest
benefactors of your country. Enjoy and occupy the quiet which, after
many trials, the providence of God hath bestowed upon you, in the bosom
of your friends; and may you be spared until you have made known the
multitude of your thoughts, unto those who at present value, or shall
hereafter arise to value, their worth.</p>
<p>I have partaken so much high intellectual enjoyment from being admitted
into the close and familiar intercourse with which you have honoured me,
and your many conversations concerning the revelations of the Christian
faith have been so profitable to me in every sense, as a student and a
preacher of the Gospel, as a spiritual man and a Christian pastor, and
your high intelligence and great learning have at all times so kindly
stooped to my ignorance and inexperience, that not merely with the
affection of friend to friend, and the honour due from youth to
experienced age, but with the gratitude of a disciple to a wise and
generous teacher, of an anxious inquirer to the good man who hath helped
him in the way of truth, I do now presume to offer you the first-fruits
of my mind since it received a new impulse towards truth, and a new
insight into its depths, from listening to your discourse. Accept them
in good part, and be assured that however insignificant in themselves,
they are the offering of a heart which loves your heart, and of a mind
which looks up with reverence to your mind.</p>

<p>LETTER 358</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON AND LUCY BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. December 1, 1824.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—If Mr. Mitford will send me a full and circumstantial
description of his desired vases, I will transmit the same to a
Gentleman resident at Canton, whom I think I have interest enough in to
take the proper care for their execution. But Mr. M. must have patience.
China is a great way off, further perhaps than he thinks; and his next
year's roses must be content to wither in a Wedgewood pot. He will
please to say whether he should like his Arms upon them, &amp;c. I send
herewith some patterns which suggest themselves to me at the first blush
of the subject, but he will probably consult his own taste after all.</p>
<p>[Illustration: Handdrawn sketch]</p>
<p>The last pattern is obviously fitted for ranunculuses only. The two
former may indifferently hold daisies, marjoram, sweet williams, and
that sort. My friend in Canton is Inspector of Teas, his name Ball; and
I can think of no better tunnel. I shall expect Mr. M.'s decision.</p>
<p>Taylor and Hessey finding their magazine goes off very heavily at 2s.
6d. are prudently going to raise their price another shilling; and
having already more authors than they want, intend to increase the
number of them. If they set up against the New Monthly, they must change
their present hands. It is not tying the dead carcase of a Review to a
half-dead Magazine will do their business. It is like G.D. multiplying
his volumes to make 'em sell better. When he finds one will not go off,
he publishes two; two stick, he tries three; three hang fire, he is
confident that four will have a better chance.</p>
<p>And now, my dear Sir, trifling apart, the gloomy catastrophe of
yesterday morning prompts a sadder vein. The fate of the unfortunate
Fauntleroy makes me, whether I will or no, to cast reflecting eyes
around on such of my friends as by a parity of situation are exposed to
a similarity of temptation. My very style, seems to myself to become
more impressive than usual, with the change of theme. Who that standeth,
knoweth but he may yet fall? Your hands as yet, I am most willing to
believe, have never deviated into others' property. You think it
impossible that you could ever commit so heinous an offence. But so
thought Fauntleroy once; so have thought many besides him, who at last
have expiated, as he hath done. You are as yet upright. But you are a
Banker, at least the next thing to it. I feel the delicacy of the
subject; but cash must pass thro' your hands, sometimes to a great
amount. If in an unguarded hour—but I will hope better. Consider the
scandal it will bring upon those of your persuasion. Thousands would go
to see a Quaker hanged, that would be indifferent to the fate of a
Presbyterian, or an Anabaptist. Think of the effect it would have on the
sale of your poems alone; not to mention higher considerations. I
tremble, I am sure, at myself, when I think that so many poor victims of
the Law at one time of their life made as sure of never being hanged as
I in my presumption am too ready to do myself. What are we better than
they? Do we come into the world with different necks? Is there any
distinctive mark under our left ears? Are we unstrangulable? I ask you.
Think of these things. I am shocked sometimes at the shape of my own
fingers, not for their resemblance to the ape tribe (which is something)
but for the exquisite adaptation of them to the purposes of picking,
fingering, &amp;c. No one that is so framed, I maintain it, but should
tremble.</p>
<p>Postscript for your Daughter's eyes only.</p>
<p>Dear Miss —— Your pretty little letterets make me ashamed of my great
straggling coarse handwriting. I wonder where you get pens to write so
small. Sure they must be the pinions of a small wren, or a robin. If you
write so in your Album, you must give us glasses to read by. I have seen
a Lady's similar book all writ in following fashion. I think it pretty
and fanciful.</p>

<p>[The <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> began a new series at half a crown with the
number for January, 1825. It had begun to decline very noticeably. The
<emphasis>New Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, to the January number of which Lamb contributed
his "Illustrious Defunct" essay, was its most serious rival. Lamb
returned to some of his old vivacity and copiousness in the <emphasis>London
Magazine</emphasis> for January, 1825. To that number he contributed his
"Biographical Memoir of Mr. Liston" and the "Vision of Horns"; and to
the February number "Letter to an Old Gentleman," "Unitarian Protests"
and the "Autobiography of Mr. Munden."</p>
<p>"G.D."—George Dyer again.</p>
<p>"Fauntleroy." See note above. Fauntleroy's fate seems to have had great
fascination for Lamb. He returned to the subject, in the vein of this
letter, in "The Last Peach," a little essay printed in the <emphasis>London
Magazine</emphasis> for April, 1825 (see Vol. I. of this edition); and in
<emphasis>Memories of old Friends, being Extracts from the Journals and Letters
of Caroline Fox, … from 1835 to 1871</emphasis>, 1882, I find the following
entry:—</p>
<p>October 25 [l839].—G. Wightwick and others dined with us. He talked
agreeably about capital punishments, greatly doubting their having any
effect in preventing crime. Soon after Fauntleroy was hanged, an
advertisement appeared, "To all good Christians! Pray for the soul of
Fauntleroy." This created a good deal of speculation as to whether he
was a Catholic, and at one of Coleridge's soirées it was discussed for a
considerable time; at length Coleridge, turning to Lamb, asked, "Do you
know anything about this affair?" "I should think I d-d-d-did," said
Elia, "for I paid s-s-s-seven and sixpence for it!"</p>
<p>Lamb's postscript is written in extremely small characters, and —the
letters of the two lines of verse are in alternate red and black inks.
It was this letter which, Edward FitzGerald tells us, Thackeray pressed
to his forehead, with the remark "Saint Charles!" Hitherto, the
postscript not having been thought worthy of print by previous editors,
it was a little difficult to understand why this particular letter had
been selected for Thackeray's epithet. But when one thinks of the
patience with which, after making gentle fun of her father, Lamb sat
down to amuse Lucy Barton, and, as Thackeray did, thinks also of his
whole life, it becomes more clear.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter to Alaric A. Watts dated Dec. 28, 1824, in
reply to a request for a contribution to one of this inveterate
album-maker's albums. Lamb acquiesces. Later he came to curse the
things. Given in the Boston Bibliophile edition.]</p>

<p>My Dear Sir—Pray return my best thanks to your father for his little
volume. It is like all of his I have seen, spirited, good humoured, and
redolent of the wit and humour of a century ago. He should have lived
with Gay and his set. The Chessiad is so clever that I relish'd it in
spite of my total ignorance of the game. I have it not before me, but I
remember a capital simile of the Charwoman letting in her Watchman
husband, which is better than Butler's Lobster turned to Red. Hazard is
a grand Character, Jove in his Chair. When you are disposed to leave
your one room for my six, Colebrooke is where it was, and my sister begs
me to add that as she is disappointed of meeting your sister <emphasis>your way</emphasis>,
we shall be most happy to see her <emphasis>our way</emphasis>, when you have an even'g to
spare. Do not stand on ceremonies and introductions, but come at once. I
need not say that if you can induce your father to join the party, it
will be so much the pleasanter. Can you name an evening <emphasis>next week</emphasis>? I
give you long credit.</p>

<p>[Charles Dibdin the Younger wrote a mock-heroic poem, "The Chessiad,"

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS ALLSOP</strong></p>
<p>Jan. 17, 1825.</p>
<p>Dear Allsop—I acknowledge with thanks the receipt of a draft on Messrs.
Wms. for £81:11:3 which I haste to cash in the present alarming state of
the money market. Hurst and Robinson gone. I have imagined a chorus of
ill-used authors singing on the occasion:</p>
<p>            What should we when Booksellers break?
            We should rejoice
            da Capo.</p>
<p>We regret exceed'ly Mrs. Allsop's being unwell. Mary or both will come
and see her soon. The frost is cruel, and we have both colds. I take
Pills again, which battle with your wine &amp; victory hovers doubtful. By
the bye, tho' not disinclined to presents I remember our bargain to take
a dozen at sale price and must demur. With once again thanks and best
loves to Mrs. A.</p>

<p>[Hurst and Robinson were publishers. Lamb took the idea for his chorus
from Davenant's version of "Macbeth" which he described in <emphasis>The
Spectator</emphasis> in 1828 (see Vol. I. of the present edition). It is there a
chorus of witches—</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SARAH HUTCHINSON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. January 20, 1825.]</p>
<p>The brevity of this is owing to scratching it off at my desk amid
expected interruptions. By habit, I can write Letters only at office.</p>
<p>Dear Miss H. Thank you for a noble Goose, which wanted only the massive
Encrustation that we used to pick-axe open about this season in old
Gloster Place. When shall we eat another Goosepye together? The pheasant
too must not be forgotten, twice as big and half as good as a partridge.
You ask about the editor of the Lond. I know of none. This first
specimen is flat and pert enough to justify subscribers who grudge at
t'other shilling. De Quincey's Parody was submitted to him before
printed, and had his Probatum. The "Horns" is in a poor taste,
resembling the most laboured papers in the Spectator. I had sign'd it
"Jack Horner:" but Taylor and Hessey said, it would be thought an
offensive article, unless I put my known signature to it; and wrung from
me my slow consent. But did you read the "Memoir of Liston"? and did you
guess whose it was? Of all the Lies I ever put off, I value this most.
It is from top to toe, every paragraph, Pure Invention; and has passed
for Gospel, has been republished in newspapers, and in the penny
play-bills of the Night, as an authentic Account. I shall certainly go
to the Naughty Man some day for my Fibbings. In the next No. I figure as
a Theologian! and have attacked my late brethren, the Unitarians. What
Jack Pudding tricks I shall play next, I know not. I am almost at the
end of my Tether.</p>
<p>Coleridge is quite blooming; but his Book has not budded yet. I hope I
have spelt Torquay right now, and that this will find you all mending,

Lamb and Novello that Lamb should affect to know a great deal about
music. See the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "A Chapter on Ears" for a description of

<p>LETTER 363</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: 10 February, 1825.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I am vexed that ugly paper should have offended. I kept it
as clear from objectionable phrases as possible, and it was Hessey's
fault, and my weakness, that it did not appear anonymous. No more of it
for God's sake.</p>
<p>The Spirit of the Age is by Hazlitt. The characters of Coleridge, &amp;c. he
had done better in former publications, the praise and the abuse much
stronger, &amp;c. but the new ones are capitally done. Horne Tooke is a
matchless portrait. My advice is, to borrow it rather than read [? buy]
it. I have it. He has laid on too many colours on my likeness, but I
have had so much injustice done me in my own name, that I make a rule of
accepting as much over-measure to Elia as Gentlemen think proper to
bestow. Lay it on and spare not.</p>
<p>Your Gentleman Brother sets my mouth a watering after Liberty. O that I
were kicked out of Leadenhall with every mark of indignity, and a
competence in my fob. The birds of the air would not be so free as I
should. How I would prance and curvet it, and pick up cowslips, and
ramble about purposeless as an ideot! The Author-mometer is a good
fancy. I have caused great speculation in the dramatic (not <emphasis>thy</emphasis>) world
by a Lying Life of Liston, all pure invention. The Town has swallowed
it, and it is copied into News Papers, Play Bills, etc., as authentic.
You do not know the Droll, and possibly missed reading the article (in
our 1st No., New Series). A life more improbable for him to have lived
would not be easily invented. But your rebuke, coupled with "Dream on J.
Bunyan," checks me. I'd rather do more in my favorite way, but feel dry.
I must laugh sometimes. I am poor Hypochondriacus, and <emphasis>not</emphasis> Liston.</p>
<p>Our 2'nd N'o is all trash. What are T. and H. about? It is whip
syllabub, "thin sown with aught of profit or delight." Thin sown! not a
germ of fruit or corn. Why did poor Scott die! There was comfort in
writing with such associates as were his little band of Scribblers, some
gone away, some affronted away, and I am left as the solitary widow
looking for water cresses.</p>
<p>The only clever hand they have is Darley, who has written on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dramatists, under name of John Lacy. But his function seems suspended.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I have been harassed more than usually at office, which has stopt my
correspondence lately. I write with a confused aching head, and you must
accept this apology for a Letter.</p>
<p>I will do something soon if I can as a peace offering to the Queen of
the East Angles. Something she shan't scold about.</p>
<p>For the Present, farewell.</p>

<p>["That ugly paper" was "A Vision of Horns."</p>
<p>Hazlitt's <emphasis>Spirit of the Age</emphasis> had just been published, containing
criticisms, among others, of Coleridge, Horne Tooke, and Lamb. Lamb was
very highly praised. Here is a passage from the article:—</p>
<p>    How admirably he has sketched the former inmates of the South-Sea
    House; what "fine fretwork he makes of their double and single
    entries!" With what a firm yet subtle pencil he has embodied "Mrs.
    Battle's Opinions on Whist!" How notably he embalms a battered
    <emphasis>beau</emphasis>; how delightfully an amour, that was cold forty years ago,
    revives in his pages! With what well-disguised humour he introduces
    us to his relations, and how freely he serves up his friends!
    Certainly, some of his portraits are <emphasis>fixtures</emphasis>, and will do to hang
    up as lasting and lively emblems of human infirmity. Then there is
    no one who has so sure an ear for "the chimes at midnight," not even
    excepting Mr. Justice Shallow; nor could Master Silence himself take
    his "cheese and pippins" with a more significant and satisfactory
    air. With what a gusto Mr. Lamb describes the Inns and Courts of
    law, the Temple and Gray's Inn, as if he had been a student there
    for the last two hundred years, and had been as well acquainted with
    the person of Sir Francis Bacon as he is with his portrait or
    writings! It is hard to say whether St. John's Gate is connected
    with more intense and authentic associations in his mind, as a part
    of old London Wall, or as the frontispiece (time out of mind) of the
    <emphasis>Gentleman's Magazine</emphasis>. He hunts Watling Street like a gentle
    spirit; the avenues to the play-houses are thick with panting
    recollections; and Christ's Hospital still breathes the balmy breath
    of infancy in his description of it!</p>

<p>Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I have had no impulse to write, or attend to any single
object but myself, for weeks past. My single self. I by myself I. I am
sick of hope deferred. The grand wheel is in agitation that is to turn
up my Fortune, but round it rolls and will turn up nothing. I have a
glimpse of Freedom, of becoming a Gentleman at large, but I am put off
from day to day. I have offered my resignation, and it is neither
accepted nor rejected. Eight weeks am I kept in this fearful suspence.
Guess what an absorbing stake I feel it. I am not conscious of the
existence of friends present or absent. The E.I. Directors alone can be
that thing to me—or not.—</p>
<p>I have just learn'd that nothing will be decided this week. Why the
next? Why any week? It has fretted me into an itch of the fingers, I rub
'em against Paper and write to you, rather than not allay this Scorbuta.</p>
<p>While I can write, let me adjure you to have no doubts of Irving. Let
Mr. Mitford drop his disrespect. Irving has prefixed a dedication (of a
Missionary Subject 1st part) to Coleridge, the most beautiful cordial
and sincere. He there acknowledges his obligation to S.T.C. for his
knowledge of Gospel truths, the nature of a Xtian Church, etc., to the
talk of S.T.C. (at whose Gamaliel feet he sits weekly) [more] than to
that of all the men living. This from him—The great dandled and petted
Sectarian—to a religious character so equivocal in the world's Eye as
that of S.T.C., so foreign to the Kirk's estimate!—Can this man be a
Quack? The language is as affecting as the Spirit of the Dedication.
Some friend told him, "This dedication will do you no Good," <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis> not
in the world's repute, or with your own People. "That is a reason for
doing it," quoth Irving.</p>
<p>I am thoroughly pleased with him. He is firm, outspeaking, intrepid—and
docile as a pupil of Pythagoras.</p>
<p>You must like him.</p>

his obtaining his discharge, with a pension of almost £400 a year, from
the India House. This he announced to me by a note put into my letter
box: 'I have left the India House. D——— Time. I'm all for eternity.'
He was rather more than 50 years of age. I found him and his Sister in
high spirits when I called to wish them joy on the 22 of April. 'I never
saw him so calmly cheerful,' says my journal, 'as he seemed then.'" See

<p>LETTER 368</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>Colebrook Cottage,</p>
<p>6 April, 1825.</p>
<p>Dear Wordsworth, I have been several times meditating a letter to you
concerning the good thing which has befallen me, but the thought of poor
Monkhouse came across me. He was one that I had exulted in the prospect
of congratulating me. He and you were to have been the first
participators, for indeed it has been ten weeks since the first motion
of it.</p>
<p>Here I am then after 33 years slavery, sitting in my own room at 11
o'Clock this finest of all April mornings a freed man, with £441 a year
for the remainder of my life, live I as long as John Dennis, who
outlived his annuity and starved at 90. £441, i.e. £450, with a
deduction of £9 for a provision secured to my sister, she being
survivor, the Pension guaranteed by Act Georgii Tertii, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I came home for ever on Tuesday in last week. The incomprehensibleness
of my condition overwhelm'd me. It was like passing from life into
Eternity. Every year to be as long as three, i.e. to have three times as
much real time, time that is my own, in it! I wandered about thinking I
was happy, but feeling I was not. But that tumultuousness is passing
off, and I begin to understand the nature of the gift. Holydays, even
the annual month, were always uneasy joys: their conscious
fugitiveness—the craving after making the most of them. Now, when all
is holyday, there are no holydays. I can sit at home in rain or shine
without a restless impulse for walkings. I am daily steadying, and shall
soon find it as natural to me to be my own master, as it has been
irksome to have had a master. Mary wakes every morning with an obscure
feeling that some good has happened to us.</p>
<p>Leigh Hunt and Montgomery after their releasements describe the shock of
their emancipation much as I feel mine. But it hurt their frames. I eat,
drink, and sleep sound as ever. I lay no anxious schemes for going
hither and thither, but take things as they occur. Yesterday I
excursioned 20 miles, to day I write a few letters. Pleasuring was for
fugitive play days, mine are fugitive only in the sense that life is
fugitive. Freedom and life co-existent.</p>
<p>At the foot of such a call upon you for gratulation, I am ashamd to
advert to that melancholy event. Monkhouse was a character I learnd to
love slowly, but it grew upon me, yearly, monthly, daily. What a chasm
has it made in our pleasant parties! His noble friendly face was always
coming before me, till this hurrying event in my life came, and for the
time has absorpt all interests. In fact it has shaken me a little. My
old desk companions with whom I have had such merry hours seem to
reproach me for removing my lot from among them. They were pleasant
creatures, but to the anxieties of business, and a weight of possible
worse ever impending, I was not equal. Tuthill and Gilman gave me my
certificates. I laughed at the friendly lie implied in them, but my
sister shook her head and said it was all true. Indeed this last winter
I was jaded out, winters were always worse than other parts of the year,
because the spirits are worse, and I had no daylight. In summer I had
daylight evenings. The relief was hinted to me from a superior power,
when I poor slave had not a hope but that I must wait another 7 years
with Jacob—and lo! the Rachel which I coveted is bro't to me—</p>
<p>Have you read the noble dedication of Irving's "Missionary Orations" to
S.T.C. Who shall call this man a Quack hereafter? What the Kirk will
think of it neither I nor Irving care. When somebody suggested to him
that it would not be likely to do him good, videlicet among his own
people, "That is a reason for doing it" was his noble answer.</p>
<p>That Irving thinks he has profited mainly by S.T.C., I have no doubt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The very style of the Ded. shows it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Communicate my news to Southey, and beg his pardon for my being so long
acknowledging his kind present of the "Church," which circumstances I do
not wish to explain, but having no reference to himself, prevented at
the time. Assure him of my deep respect and friendliest feelings.</p>
<p>Divide the same, or rather each take the whole to you, I mean you and
all yours. To Miss Hutchinson I must write separate. What's her address?

resignation might be well accepted from me. This was a kind bird's
whisper. On that hint I spake. Gilman and Tuthill furnishd me with
certificates of wasted health and sore spirits—not much more than the
truth, I promise you—and for 9 weeks I was kept in a fright— I had
gone too far to recede, and they might take advantage and dismiss me
with a much less sum than I had reckoned on. However Liberty came at
last with a liberal provision. I have given up what I could have lived
on in the country, but have enough to live here by managem't and
scribbling occasionally. I would not go back to my prison for seven
years longer for £10000 a year. 7 years after one is 50 is no trifle to
give up. Still I am a young <emphasis>Pensioner</emphasis>, and have served but 33 years,
very few I assure you retire before 40, 45, or 50 years' service.</p>
<p>You will ask how I bear my freedom. Faith, for some days I was
staggered. Could not comprehend the magnitude of my deliverance, was
confused, giddy, knew not whether I was on my head or my heel as they
say. But those giddy feelings have gone away, and my weather glass
stands at a degree or two above</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                           CONTENT</strong></p>
<p>I go about quiet, and have none of that restless hunting after
recreation which made holydays formerly uneasy joys. All being holydays,
I feel as if I had none, as they do in heaven, where 'tis all red letter
days.</p>
<p>I have a kind letter from the Words'wths <emphasis>congratulatory</emphasis> not a little.</p>
<p>It is a damp, I do assure you, amid all my prospects that I can receive
<emphasis>none</emphasis> from a quarter upon which I had calculated, almost more than from
any, upon receiving congratulations. I had grown to like poor M. more
and more. I do not esteem a soul living or not living more warmly than I
had grown to esteem and value him. But words are vain. We have none of
us to count upon many years. That is the only cure for sad thoughts. If
only some died, and the rest were permanent on earth, what a thing a
friend's death would be then!</p>
<p>I must take leave, having put off answering [a load] of letters to this
morning, and this, alas! is the 1st. Our kindest remembrances to Mrs.
Monkhouse and believe us</p>

<p>Dear W. I write post-hoste to ensure a frank. Thanks for your hearty
congratulations. I may now date from the 6th week of my Hegira or Flight
from Leadenhall. I have lived so much in it, that a Summer seems already
past, and 'tis but early May yet with you and other people. How I look
down on the Slaves and drudges of the world! its inhabitants are a vast
cotton-web of spin spin spinners. O the carking cares! O the
money-grubbers-sempiternal muckworms!</p>
<p>Your Virgil I have lost sight of, but suspect it is in the hands of Sir
G. Beaumont. I think that circumstances made me shy of procuring it
before. Will you write to him about it? and your commands shall be
obeyed to a tittle.</p>
<p>Coleridge has just finishd his prize Essay, which if it get the Prize
he'll touch an additional £100 I fancy. His Book too (commentary on

thing called Barbara S——— a story gleaned from Miss Kelly. The L.M.
if you can get it will save my enlargement upon the topic of my
manumission.</p>
<p>I must scribble to make up my hiatus crumenae, for there are so many
ways, pious and profligate, of getting rid of money in this vast city
and suburbs that I shall miss my third: but couragio. I despair not.
Your kind hint of the Cottage was well thrown out. An anchorage for
<emphasis>age</emphasis> and school of economy when necessity comes. But without this
latter I have an unconquerable terror of changing Place. It does not
agree with us. I say it from conviction. Else—I do sometimes ruralize
in fancy.</p>
<p>Some d———d people are come in and I must finish abruptly. By
d———d, I only mean <emphasis>deuced</emphasis>. 'Tis these suitors of Penelope that make
it necessary to authorise a little for gin and mutton and such trifles.</p>

<p>LETTER 373</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO CHARLES CHAMBERS</strong></p>
<p>[Undated. ? May, 1825.]</p>
<p>With regard to a John-dory, which you desire to be particularly informed
about, I honour the fish, but it is rather on account of Quin who
patronised it, and whose taste (of a <emphasis>dead</emphasis> man) I had as lieve go by as
anybody's (Apicius and Heliogabalus excepted—this latter started
nightingales' tongues and peacocks' brains as a garnish).</p>
<p>Else in <emphasis>itself</emphasis>, and trusting to my own poor single judgment, it hath
not that moist mellow oleaginous gliding smooth descent from the tongue
to the palate, thence to the stomach, &amp;c., that your Brighton Turbot
hath, which I take to be the most friendly and familiar flavor of any
that swims—most genial and at home to the palate.</p>
<p>Nor has it on the other hand that fine falling off flakiness, that
oleaginous peeling off (as it were, like a sea onion), which endears
your cod's head &amp; shoulders to some appetites; that manly firmness,
combined with a sort of womanish coming-in-pieces, which the same cod's
head &amp; shoulders hath, where the whole is easily separable, pliant to a
knife or a spoon, but each individual flake presents a pleasing
resistance to the opposed tooth. You understand me—these delicate
subjects are necessarily obscure.</p>
<p>But it has a third flavor of its own, perfectly distinct from Cod or
Turbot, which it must be owned may to some not injudicious palates
render it acceptable—but to my unpractised tooth it presented rather a
crude river-fish-flavor, like your Pike or Carp, and perhaps like them
should have been tamed &amp; corrected by some laborious &amp; well chosen
sauce. Still I always suspect a fish which requires so much of
artificial settings-off. Your choicest relishes (like nature's
loveliness) need not the foreign aid of ornament, but are when unadorned
(that is, with nothing but a little plain anchovy &amp; a squeeze of lemon)
then adorned the most. However, I shall go to Brighton again next
Summer, and shall have an opportunity of correcting my judgment, if it
is not sufficiently informed. I can only say that when Nature was
pleased to make the John Dory so notoriously deficient in outward graces
(as to be sure he is the very Rhinoceros of fishes, the ugliest dog that
swims, except perhaps the Sea Satyr, which I never saw, but which they
say is terrible), when she formed him with so few external advantages,
she might have bestowed a more elaborate finish in his parts internal, &amp;
have given him a relish, a sapor, to recommend him, as she made Pope a
Poet to make up for making him crooked.</p>
<p>I am sorry to find that you have got a knack of saying things which are
not true to shew your wit. If I had no wit but what I must shew at the
expence of my virtue or my modesty, I had as lieve be as stupid as * * *
at the Tea Warehouse. Depend upon it, my dear Chambers, that an ounce of
integrity at our death-bed will stand us in more avail than all the wit
of Congreve or… For instance, you tell me a fine story about Truss,
and his playing at Leamington, which I know to be false, because I have
advice from Derby that he was whipt through the Town on that very day
you say he appeared in some character or other, for robbing an old woman
at church of a seal ring. And Dr. Parr has been two months dead. So it
won't do to scatter these untrue stories about among people that know
any thing. Besides, your forte is not invention. It is <emphasis>judgment</emphasis>,
particularly shown in your choice of dishes. We seem in that instance
born under one star. I like you for liking hare. I esteem you for
disrelishing minced veal. Liking is too cold a word.—I love you for
your noble attachment to the fat unctuous juices of deer's flesh &amp; the
green unspeakable of turtle. I honour you for your endeavours to esteem
and approve of my favorite, which I ventured to recommend to you as a
substitute for hare, bullock's heart, and I am not offended that you
cannot taste it with <emphasis>my</emphasis> palate. A true son of Epicurus should reserve
one taste peculiar to himself. For a long time I kept the secret about
the exceeding deliciousness of the marrow of boiled knuckle of veal,
till my tongue weakly ran riot in its praises, and now it is prostitute
&amp; common.—But I have made one discovery which I will not impart till my
dying scene is over, perhaps it will be my last mouthful in this world:
delicious thought, enough to sweeten (or rather make savoury) the hour
of death. It is a little square bit about this size in or near the
knuckle bone of a fried joint of… fat I can't call it nor lean</p>
<p>[Illustration: Handrawn sketch]</p>
<p>neither altogether, it is that beautiful compound, which Nature must
have made in Paradise Park venison, before she separated the two
substances, the dry &amp; the oleaginous, to punish sinful mankind; Adam ate
them entire &amp; inseparate, and this little taste of Eden in the knuckle
bone of a fried… seems the only relique of a Paradisaical state. When
I die, an exact description of its topography shall be left in a
cupboard with a key, inscribed on which these words, "C. Lamb dying
imparts this to C. Chambers as the only worthy depository of such a
secret." You'll drop a tear….</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Charles Chambers was the brother of John Chambers (see above). He had
been at Christ's Hospital with Lamb and subsequently became a surgeon in
the Navy. He retired to Leamington and practised there until his death,
somewhen about 1857, says Mr. Hazlitt. He seems to have inherited some
of the epicure's tastes of his father, the "sensible clergyman in
Warwickshire" who, Lamb tells us in "Thoughts on Presents of Game,"
"used to allow a pound of Epping to every hare."</p>
<p>This letter adds one more to the list of Lamb's gustatory raptures, and
it is remarkable as being his only eulogy of fish. Mr. Hazlitt says that
the date September 1, 1817, has been added by another hand; but if the
remark about Dr. Parr is true (he died March 6, 1825) the time is as I
have stated. Fortunately the date in this particular case is
unimportant. Mr. Hazlitt suggests that the stupid person in the Tea
Warehouse was Bye, whom we met recently.</p>
<p>Of Truss we know nothing. The name may be a misreading of Twiss (Horace
Twiss, 1787-1849, politician, buffoon, and Mrs. Siddons' nephew), who
was quite a likely person to be lied about in joke at that time.</p>

appointment: "I am as mad as the devil." Given in the Boston Bibliophile

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE</strong></p>
<p>[? June, 1825.]</p>
<p>My dear Coleridge,—With pain and grief, I must entreat you to excuse us
on Thursday. My head, though externally correct, has had a severe
concussion in my long illness, and the very idea of an engagement
hanging over for a day or two, forbids my rest; and I get up miserable.
I am not well enough for company. I do assure you, no other thing
prevents my coming. I expect Field and his brothers this or to-morrow
evening, and it worries me to death that I am not ostensibly ill enough
to put 'em off. I will get better, when I shall hope to see your nephew.
He will come again. Mary joins in best love to the Gillmans. Do, I
earnestly entreat you, excuse me. I assure you, again, that I am not fit
to go out yet.</p>

<p>[This letter has previously been dated 1829, but I think wrongly. Lamb
had no long illness then, and Field was then in Gibraltar, where he was
Chief-Justice. Lamb's long illness was in 1825, when Coleridge's
Thursday evenings at Highgate were regular. Coleridge's nephew may have
been one of several. I fancy it was the Rev. Edward Coleridge. Henry
Nelson Coleridge had already left, I think, for the West Indies.]</p>

<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I am quite ashamed, after your kind letter, of having expressed any
disappointment about my remuneration. It is quite equivalent to the
value of any thing I have yet sent you. I had Twenty Guineas a sheet
from the London; and what I did for them was more worth that sum, than
any thing, I am afraid, I can now produce, would be worth the lesser
sum. I used up all my best thoughts in that publication, and I do not
like to go on writing worse &amp; worse, &amp; feeling that I do so. I want to
try something else. However, if any subject turns up, which I think will
do your Magazine no discredit, you shall have it at <emphasis>your</emphasis> price, or
something between <emphasis>that</emphasis> and my old price. I prefer writing to seeing
you just now, for after such a letter as I have received from you, in
truth I am ashamed to see you. We will never mention the thing again.</p>

<p>LETTER 376</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. July 2, 1825.]</p>
<p>Dear C.—We are going off to Enfield, to Allsop's, for a day or 2, with
some intention of succeeding them in their lodging for a time, for this
damn'd nervous Fever (vide Lond. Mag. for July) indisposes me for seeing
any friends, and never any poor devil was so befriended as I am. Do you
know any poor solitary human that wants that cordial to life a—true
friend? I can spare him twenty, he shall have 'em good cheap. I have
gallipots of 'em—genuine balm of cares—a going—a going—a going.
Little plagues plague me a 1000 times more than ever. I am like a
disembodied soul—in this my eternity. I feel every thing entirely, all
in all and all in etc. This price I pay for liberty, but am richly
content to pay it. The Odes are 4-5ths done by Hood, a silentish young
man you met at Islinton one day, an invalid. The rest are Reynolds's,
whose sister H. has recently married. I have not had a broken finger in
them.</p>
<p>They are hearty good-natured things, and I would put my name to 'em
chearfully, if I could as honestly. I complimented them in a Newspaper,
with an abatement for those puns you laud so. They are generally an
excess. A Pun is a thing of too much consequence to be thrown in as a
make-weight. You shall read one of the addresses over, and miss the
puns, and it shall be quite as good and better than when you discover
'em. A Pun is a Noble Thing per se: O never lug it in as an accessory. A
Pun is a sole object for reflection (vide <emphasis>my</emphasis> aids to that recessment
from a savage state)—it is entire, it fills the mind: it is perfect as
a Sonnet, better. It limps asham'd in the train and retinue of Humour:
it knows it should have an establishment of its own. The one, for
instance, I made the other day, I forget what it was.</p>
<p>Hood will be gratify'd, as much as I am, by your mistake. I liked
'Grimaldi' the best; it is true painting, of abstract Clownery, and that
precious concrete of a Clown: and the rich succession of images, and
words almost such, in the first half of the Mag. Ignotum. Your picture
of the Camel, that would not or could not thread your nice needle-eye of
Subtilisms, was confirm'd by Elton, who perfectly appreciated his abrupt
departure. Elton borrowed the "Aids" from Hessey (by the way what is
your Enigma about Cupid? I am Cytherea's son, if I understand a tittle
of it), and returnd it next day saying that 20 years ago, when he was
pure, he <emphasis>thought</emphasis> as you do now, but that he now thinks as you did 20
years ago. But E. seems a very honest fellow. Hood has just come in; his
sick eyes sparkled into health when he read your approbation. They had
meditated a copy for you, but postponed it till a neater 2d Edition,
which is at hand.</p>

was printed.</p>
<p>"The Odes"—<emphasis>Odes and Addresses to Great People, 1825.</emphasis> Coleridge after
reading the book had written to Lamb as follows (the letter is printed
by Hood):—</p>
<p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—This afternoon, a little, thin, mean-looking sort of a
foolscap, sub-octavo of poems, printed on very dingy outsides, lay on
the table, which the cover informed me was circulating in our book-club,
so very Grub-Streetish in all its appearance, internal as well as
external, that I cannot explain by what accident of impulse (assuredly
there was no <emphasis>motive</emphasis> in play) I came to look into it. Least of all, the
title, Odes and Addresses to Great Men, which connected itself in my
head with Rejected Addresses, and all the Smith and Theodore Hook squad.
But, my dear Charles, it was certainly written by you, or under you, or
<emphasis>una eum</emphasis> you. I know none of your frequent visitors capacious and
assimilative enough of your converse to have reproduced you so honestly,
supposing you had left yourself in pledge in his lock-up house. Gillman,
to whom I read the spirited parody on the introduction to Peter Bell,
the Ode to the Great Unknown, and to Mrs. Fry; he speaks doubtfully of
Reynolds and Hood. But here come Irving and Basil Montagu.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thursday night 10 o'clock</emphasis>.—No! Charles, it is <emphasis>you</emphasis>. I have read them
over again, and I understand why you have <emphasis>anon'd</emphasis> the book. The puns
are nine in ten good—many excellent —the Newgatory transcendent. And
then the <emphasis>exemplum sine exemplo</emphasis> of a volume of personalities, and
contemporaneities, without a single line that could inflict the
infinitesimal of an unpleasance on any man in his senses: saving and
except perhaps in the envy-addled brain of the despiser of your <emphasis>Lays</emphasis>.
If not a triumph over him, it is at least an <emphasis>ovation</emphasis>. Then, moreover,
and besides, to speak with becoming modesty, excepting my own self, who
is there but you who can write the musical lines and stanzas that are
intermixed?</p>
<p>Here, Gillman, come up to my Garret, and driven back by the guardian
spirits of four huge flower-holders of omnigenous roses and
honeysuckles—(Lord have mercy on his hysterical olfactories! What will
he do in Paradise? I must have a pair or two of nostril-plugs, or
nose-goggles laid in his coffin)—stands at the door, reading that to
M'Adam, and the washer-woman's letter, and he admits <emphasis>the facts</emphasis>. You
are found <emphasis>in the manner</emphasis>, as the lawyers say! so, Mr. Charles! hang
yourself up, and send me a line, by way of token and acknowledgment. My
dear love to Mary. God bless you and your Unshamabramizer.</p>

<p>The newspaper in which Lamb complimented the book was the <emphasis>New Times</emphasis>,
for April 12, 1825. See Vol. I. of the present edition for the review,
where the remarks on puns are repeated. The "Mag. Ignotum" was the ode
to the Great Unknown, the author of the Scotch novels. In the same paper
on January 8, 1825, Lamb had written an essay called "Many Friends" (see
Vol. I.) a little in the manner of this first paragraph.</p>
<p>"Your picture of the Camel." Probably the story of a caller told by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Coleridge to Lamb in a letter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Your Enigma about Cupid." Possibly referring to the following passage
in the <emphasis>Aids to Reflection</emphasis>, 1825, pages 277-278:—</p>
<p>    From the remote East turn to the mythology of Minor Asia, to the
    Descendants of Javan <emphasis>who dwelt in the tents of Shem, and possessed
    the Isles</emphasis>. Here again, and in the usual form of an historic
    Solution, we find the same <emphasis>Fact</emphasis>, and as characteristic of the
    Human <emphasis>Race</emphasis>, stated in that earliest and most venerable Mythus (or
    symbolic Parable) of Prometheus—that truly wonderful Fable, in
    which the characters of the rebellious Spirit and of the Divine
    Friend of Mankind ([Greek: Theos philanthropos]) are united in the
    same Person: and thus in the most striking manner noting the forced
    amalgamation of the Patriarchal Tradition with the incongruous
    Scheme of Pantheism. This and the connected tale of Io, which is but
    the sequel of the Prometheus, stand alone in the Greek Mythology, in
    which elsewhere both Gods and Men are mere Powers and Products of
    Nature. And most noticeable it is, that soon after the promulgation
    and spread of the Gospel had awakened the moral sense, and had
    opened the eyes even of its wiser Enemies to the necessity of
    providing some solution of this great problem of the Moral World,
    the beautiful Parable of Cupid and Psyche was brought forward as a
    <emphasis>rival</emphasis> FALL OF MAN: and the fact of a moral corruption connatural
    with the human race was again recognized. In the assertion of
    ORIGINAL SIN the Greek Mythology rose and set.</p>

She is a very pleas—, but I won't write all we have said of her so
often to ourselves, because I suspect you would read it to her. Only
give my sister's and my kindest rememb'ces to her, and how glad we are

<p>[Aitken was an Edinburgh bookseller who edited <emphasis>The Cabinet; or, The
Selected Beauties of Literature</emphasis>, 1824, 1825 and 1831. The particular
interest of the letter is that it shows Lamb to have wanted to publish
<emphasis>Rosamund Gray</emphasis> a third time in his life. Hitherto we had only his
statement that Hessey said that the world would not bear it. Aitken
printed the story in <emphasis>The Cabinet</emphasis> for 1831. Previously he had printed
"Dream Children" and "The Inconveniences of being Hanged."</p>
<p>I have been told (but have had no opportunity of verifying the
statement) that the Buttons, for one of whom the appended acrostic was
written, were cousins of the Lambs.</p>
<p>Here should come an unpublished letter to Miss Kelly thanking her for
tickets and saying that Liston is to produce Lamb's farce "The
Pawnbroker's Daughter," which "will take."</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Hone, dated Enfield, July 25,
1825. Lamb had written some quatrains to the editor of the <emphasis>Every-Day
Book</emphasis>, which were printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for May, 1825. Hone
copied them into his periodical, accompanied by a reply. Lamb began:—</p>
<p>        I like you, and your book, ingenuous Hone!</p>
<p>Hone's reply contained the sentiment:—</p>
<p>        I am "ingenuous": it is all I can</p>

        Pretend to; it is all I wish to be.</p>

occupying Lamb's house at Colebrooke Row, while the Lambs were staying
at the Allsops' lodgings at Enfield.</p>
<p>Lamb again refers to "The Pawnbroker's Daughter." He says it is at the
theatre now and Harley is there too. This would be John Pritt Harley,
the actor. The play, as it happened, was never acted.</p>

<p>LETTER 379</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. August 10, 1825.]</p>
<p>We shall be soon again at Colebrook.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—You must excuse my not writing before, when I tell you we are
on a visit at Enfield, where I do not feel it natural to sit down to a
Letter. It is at all times an exertion. I had rather talk with you, and
Ann Knight, quietly at Colebrook Lodge, over the matter of your last.
You mistake me when you express misgivings about my relishing a series
of scriptural poems. I wrote confusedly. What I meant to say was, that
one or two consolatory poems on deaths would have had a more condensed
effect than many. Scriptural— devotional topics—admit of infinite
variety. So far from poetry tiring me because religious, I can read, and
I say it seriously, the homely old version of the Psalms in our
Prayer-books for an hour or two together sometimes without sense of
weariness.</p>
<p>I did not express myself clearly about what I think a false topic
insisted on so frequently in consolatory addresses on the death of
Infants. I know something like it is in Scripture, but I think humanly
spoken. It is a natural thought, a sweet fallacy to the Survivors—but
still a fallacy. If it stands on the doctrine of this being a
probationary state, it is liable to this dilemma. Omniscience, to whom
possibility must be clear as act, must know of the child, what it would
hereafter turn out: if good, then the topic is false to say it is
secured from falling into future wilfulness, vice, &amp;c. If bad, I do not
see how its exemption from certain future overt acts by being snatched
away at all tells in its favor. You stop the arm of a murderer, or
arrest the finger of a pickpurse, but is not the guilt incurred as much
by the intent as if never so much acted? Why children are hurried off,
and old reprobates of a hundred left, whose trial humanly we may think
was complete at fifty, is among the obscurities of providence. The very
notion of a state of probation has darkness in it. The all-knower has no
need of satisfying his eyes by seeing what we will do, when he knows
before what we will do. Methinks we might be condemn'd before
commission. In these things we grope and flounder, and if we can pick up
a little human comfort that the child taken is snatch'd from vice (no
great compliment to it, by the bye), let us take it. And as to where an
untried child goes, whether to join the assembly of its elders who have
borne the heat of the day—fire-purified martyrs, and torment-sifted
confessors—what know we? We promise heaven methinks too cheaply, and
assign large revenues to minors, incompetent to manage them. Epitaphs
run upon this topic of consolation, till the very frequency induces a
cheapness. Tickets for admission into Paradise are sculptured out at a
penny a letter, twopence a syllable, &amp;c. It is all a mystery; and the
more I try to express my meaning (having none that is clear) the more I
flounder. Finally, write what your own conscience, which to you is the
unerring judge, seems best, and be careless about the whimsies of such a
half-baked notionist as I am. We are here in a most pleasant country,
full of walks, and idle to our hearts desire. Taylor has dropt the
London. It was indeed a dead weight. It has got in the Slough of
Despond. I shuffle off my part of the pack, and stand like Xtian with
light and merry shoulders. It had got silly, indecorous, pert, and every
thing that is bad. Both our kind <emphasis>remembrances</emphasis> to Mrs. K. and yourself,

<p>LETTER 380</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY</strong></p>
<p>August 10, 1825.</p>
<p>Dear Southey,—You'll know who this letter comes from by opening
slap-dash upon the text, as in the good old times. I never could come
into the custom of envelopes; 'tis a modern foppery; the Plinian
correspondence gives no hint of such. In singleness of sheet and meaning
then I thank you for your little book. I am ashamed to add a codicil of
thanks for your "Book of the Church." I scarce feel competent to give an
opinion of the latter; I have not reading enough of that kind to venture
at it. I can only say the fact, that I have read it with attention and
interest. Being, as you know, not quite a Churchman, I felt a jealousy
at the Church taking to herself the whole deserts of Christianity,
Catholic and Protestant, from Druid extirpation downwards. I call all
good Christians the Church, Capillarians and all. But I am in too light
a humour to touch these matters. May all our churches flourish! Two
things staggered me in the poem (and one of them staggered both of us).
I cannot away with a beautiful series of verses, as I protest they are,
commencing "Jenner." 'Tis like a choice banquet opened with a pill or an
electuary— physic stuff. T'other is, we cannot make out how Edith
should be no more than ten years old. By'r Lady, we had taken her to be
some sixteen or upwards. We suppose you have only chosen the round
number for the metre. Or poem and dedication may be both older than they
pretend to; but then some hint might have been given; for, as it stands,
it may only serve some day to puzzle the parish reckoning. But without
inquiring further (for 'tis ungracious to look into a lady's years), the
dedication is eminently pleasing and tender, and we wish Edith May
Southey joy of it. Something, too, struck us as if we had heard of the
death of John May. A John May's death was a few years since in the
papers. We think the tale one of the quietest, prettiest things we have
seen. You have been temperate in the use of localities, which generally
spoil poems laid in exotic regions. You mostly cannot stir out (in such
things) for humming-birds and fire-flies. A tree is a Magnolia, &amp;c.—Can
I but like the truly Catholic spirit? "Blame as thou mayest the Papist's
erring creed"—which and other passages brought me back to the old
Anthology days and the admonitory lesson to "Dear George" on the "The
Vesper Bell," a little poem which retains its first hold upon me
strangely.</p>
<p>The compliment to the translatress is daintily conceived. Nothing is
choicer in that sort of writing than to bring in some remote, impossible
parallel,—as between a great empress and the inobtrusive quiet soul who
digged her noiseless way so perseveringly through that rugged Paraguay
mine. How she Dobrizhoffered it all out, it puzzles my slender Latinity
to conjecture. Why do you seem to sanction Lander's unfeeling
allegorising away of honest Quixote! He may as well say Strap is meant
to symbolise the Scottish nation before the Union, and Random since that
act of dubious issue; or that Partridge means the Mystical Man, and Lady
Bellaston typifies the Woman upon Many Waters. Gebir, indeed, may mean
the state of the hop markets last month, for anything I know to the
contrary. That all Spain overflowed with romancical books (as Madge
Newcastle calls them) was no reason that Cervantes should not smile at
the matter of them; nor even a reason that, in another mood, he might
not multiply them, deeply as he was tinctured with the essence of them.
Quixote is the father of gentle ridicule, and at the same time the very
depository and treasury of chivalry and highest notions. Marry, when
somebody persuaded Cervantes that he meant only fun, and put him upon
writing that unfortunate Second Part with the confederacies of that
unworthy duke and most contemptible duchess, Cervantes sacrificed his
instinct to his understanding.</p>
<p>We got your little book but last night, being at Enfield, to which place
we came about a month since, and are having quiet holydays. Mary walks
her twelve miles a day some days, and I my twenty on others. 'Tis all
holiday with me now, you know. The change works admirably.</p>
<p>For literary news, in my poor way, I have a one-act farce going to be
acted at the Haymarket; but when? is the question. 'Tis an extravaganza,
and like enough to follow "Mr. H." "The London Magazine" has shifted its
publishers once more, and I shall shift myself out of it. It is fallen.
My ambition is not at present higher than to write nonsense for the
playhouses, to eke out a somewhat contracted income. <emphasis>Tempus erat</emphasis>.
There was a time, my dear Cornwallis, when the Muse, &amp;c. But I am now in
MacFleckno's predicament,—</p>
<p>        "Promised a play, and dwindled to a farce."</p>
<p>Coleridge is better (was, at least, a few weeks since) than he has been
for years. His accomplishing his book at last has been a source of
vigour to him. We are on a half visit to his friend Allsop, at a Mrs.
Leishman's, Enfield, but expect to be at Colebrooke Cottage in a week or
so, where, or anywhere, I shall be always most happy to receive tidings
from you. G. Dyer is in the height of an uxorious paradise. His
honeymoon will not wane till he wax cold. Never was a more happy pair,
since Acme and Septimius, and longer. Farewell, with many thanks, dear
S. Our loves to all round your Wrekin.</p>

<p>        Edith! ten years are number'd, since the day.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>"The compliment to the translatress." Southey took his <emphasis>Tale of
Paraguay</emphasis> from Dobrizhoffer's <emphasis>History of the Abipones</emphasis>, which his
niece, Sara Coleridge, had translated. Southey remarks in the poem that
could Dobrizhoffer have foreseen by whom his words were to be turned
into English, he would have been as pleased as when he won the ear of
the Empress Queen.</p>
<p>"Landor's … allegorising." Landor, in the conversation between "Peter
Leopold and the President du Paty," makes President du Paty say that
Cervantes had deeper purpose than the satirising of knight-errants, Don
Quixote standing for the Emperor Charles V. and Sancho Panza symbolising
the people. Southey quoted the passage in the Notes to the Proem. Lamb's
<emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on the "Defect of Imagination" (see Vol. II.) amplifies
this criticism of Don Quixote.</p>
<p>"A one-act farce." This was, I imagine, "The Pawnbroker's Daughter,"
although that is in two acts. It was not, however, acted.</p>
<p>George Dyer had just been married to the widow of a solicitor who lived
opposite him in Clifford's Inn.</p>

<p>My kind remembrances to your daughter and A.K. always.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I got your book not more than five days ago, so am not so
negligent as I must have appeared to you with a fortnight's sin upon my
shoulders. I tell you with sincerity that I think you have completely
succeeded in what you intended to do. What is poetry may be disputed.
These are poetry to me at least. They are concise, pithy, and moving.
Uniform as they are, and unhistorify'd, I read them thro' at two
sittings without one sensation approaching to tedium. I do not know that
among your many kind presents of this nature this is not my favourite
volume. The language is never lax, and there is a unity of design and
feeling, you wrote them <emphasis>with love</emphasis>—to avoid the cox-<emphasis>combical</emphasis> phrase,
con amore. I am particularly pleased with the "Spiritual Law," page
34-5. It reminded me of Quarles, and Holy Mr. Herbert, as Izaak Walton
calls him: the two best, if not only, of our devotional poets, tho' some
prefer Watts, and some <emphasis>Tom Moore</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I am far from well or in my right spirits, and shudder at pen and ink
work. I poke out a monthly crudity for Colburn in his magazine, which I
call "Popular Fallacies," and periodically crush a proverb or two,
setting up my folly against the wisdom of nations. Do you see the "New
Monthly"?</p>
<p>One word I must object to in your little book, and it recurs
more than once—FADELESS is no genuine compound; loveless
is, because love is a noun as well as verb, but what is a
fade?—and I do not quite like whipping the Greek drama upon
the back of "Genesis," page 8. I do not like praise handed
in by disparagement: as I objected to a side censure on Byron,
etc., in the lines on Bloomfield: with these poor cavils excepted,
your verses are without a flaw.                      C. LAMB.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. March 20, 1826.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—You may know my letters by the paper and the folding. For the
former, I live on scraps obtained in charity from an old friend whose
stationary is a permanent perquisite; for folding, I shall do it neatly
when I learn to tye my neckcloths. I surprise most of my friends by
writing to them on ruled paper, as if I had not got past pothooks and
hangers. Sealing wax, I have none on my establishment. Wafers of the
coarsest bran supply its place. When my Epistles come to be weighed with
Pliny's, however superior to the Roman in delicate irony, judicious
reflexions, etc., his gilt post will bribe over the judges to him. All
the time I was at the E.I.H. I never mended a pen; I now cut 'em to the
stumps, marring rather than mending the primitive goose quill. I cannot
bear to pay for articles I used to get for nothing. When Adam laid out
his first penny upon nonpareils at some stall in Mesopotamos, I think it
went hard with him, reflecting upon his old goodly orchard, where he had
so many for nothing. When I write to a Great man, at the Court end, he
opens with surprise upon a naked note, such as Whitechapel people
interchange, with no sweet degrees of envelope: I never inclosed one bit
of paper in another, nor understand the rationale of it. Once only I
seald with borrow'd wax, to set Walter Scott a wondering, sign'd with
the imperial quarterd arms of England, which my friend Field gives in
compliment to his descent in the female line from O. Cromwell. It must
have set his antiquarian curiosity upon watering. To your questions upon
the currency, I refer you to Mr. Robinson's last speech, where, if you
can find a solution, I cannot. I think this tho' the best ministry we
ever stumbled upon. Gin reduced four shillings in the gallon, wine 2
shillings in the quart. This comes home to men's minds and bosoms. My
tirade against visitors was not meant <emphasis>particularly</emphasis> at you or A.K. I
scarce know what I meant, for I do not just now feel the grievance. I
wanted to make an <emphasis>article</emphasis>. So in another thing I talkd of somebody's
<emphasis>insipid wife</emphasis>, without a correspondent object in my head: and a good
lady, a friend's wife, whom I really <emphasis>love</emphasis> (don't startle, I mean in a
licit way) has looked shyly on me ever since. The blunders of personal
application are ludicrous. I send out a character every now and then, on
purpose to exercise the ingenuity of my friends. "Popular Fallacies"
will go on; that word concluded is an erratum, I suppose, for continued.
I do not know how it got stuff'd in there. A little thing without name
will also be printed on the Religion of the Actors, but it is out of
your way, so I recommend you, with true Author's hypocrisy, to skip it.
We are about to sit down to Roast beef, at which we could wish A.K.,
B.B., and B.B.'s pleasant daughter to be humble partakers. So much for
my hint at visitors, which was scarcely calculated for droppers in from
Woodbridge. The sky does not drop such larks every day.</p>
<p>My very kindest wishes to you all three, with my sister's best love.</p>

of Ripon, then Chancellor of the Exchequer under the Earl of Liverpool.
The Government had decided to check the use of paper-money by stopping
the issue of notes for less than £5; and Robinson had made a speech on
the subject on February 10. The motion was carried, but to some extent
was compromised. It was Robinson who, as Chancellor of the Exchequer,
found the money for building the new British Museum and purchasing

about this time. Mrs. FitzGerald, in 1893, wrote out for me her

FitzGerald remembered, retained the price-labels of the stalls where he
had bought them. She also remembered a portrait over the fireplace. This

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE</strong></p>
<p>March 22nd, 1826.</p>
<p>Dear C.,—We will with great pleasure be with you on Thursday in the
next week early. Your finding out my style in your nephew's pleasant
book is surprising to me. I want eyes to descry it. You are a little too
hard upon his morality, though I confess he has more of Sterne about him
than of Sternhold. But he saddens into excellent sense before the
conclusion. Your query shall be submitted to Miss Kelly, though it is
obvious that the pantomime, when done, will be more easy to decide upon
than in proposal. I say, do it by all means. I have Decker's play by me,
if you can filch anything out of it. Miss Gray, with her kitten eyes, is
an actress, though she shows it not at all, and pupil to the former,
whose gestures she mimics in comedy to the disparagement of her own
natural manner, which is agreeable. It is funny to see her bridling up
her neck, which is native to F.K.; but there is no setting another's
manners upon one's shoulders any more than their head. I am glad you
esteem Manning, though you see but his husk or shrine. He discloses not,
save to select worshippers, and will leave the world without any one
hardly but me knowing how stupendous a creature he is. I am perfecting
myself in the "Ode to Eton College" against Thursday, that I may not
appear unclassic. I have just discovered that it is much better than the
"Elegy."</p>
<p>                                In haste,                        C.L.</p>
<p>P.S.—I do not know what to say to your <emphasis>latest</emphasis> theory about Nero being
the Messiah, though by all accounts he was a 'nointed one.</p>

<p>"Sternhold"—Thomas Sternhold, the coadjutor of Hopkins in paraphrasing
the Psalms.</p>

modernising Dekker for Fanny Kelly. Mr. Dykes Campbell suggested that
the play to be treated was "Old Fortunatus."</p>

can act the wonders of Egypt. Only he is lazy, and does not always put
forth all his strength; if he did, I know no man of genius at all
comparable to him."</p>

Possibly on this occasion some one interested in Gray was to be there,

<p>Dear Sir,—It is whispered me that you will not be unwilling to look
into our doleful hermitage. Without more preface, you will gladden our
cell by accompanying our old chums of the London, Darley and Allan
Cunningham, to Enfield on Wednesday. You shall have hermit's fare, with
talk as seraphical as the novelty of the divine life will permit, with
an innocent retrospect to the world which we have left, when I will
thank you for your hospitable offer at Chiswick, and with plain hermit
reasons evince the necessity of abiding here.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. May 16, 1826.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I have had no spirits lately to begin a letter to you, though
I am under obligations to you (how many!) for your neat little poem,
'Tis just what it professes to be, a simple tribute in chaste verse,
serious and sincere. I do not know how Friends will relish it, but we
out-lyers, Honorary Friends, like it very well. I have had my head and
ears stuff'd up with the East winds. A continual ringing in my brain of
bells jangled, or The Spheres touchd by some raw Angel. It is not George
3 trying the 100th psalm? I get my music for nothing. But the weather
seems to be softening, and will thaw my stunnings. Coleridge writing to
me a week or two since begins his note—"Summer has set in with its
usual Severity." A cold Summer is all I know of disagreeable in cold. I
do not mind the utmost rigour of real Winter, but these smiling
hypocrites of Mays wither me to death. My head has been a ringing Chaos,
like the day the winds were made, before they submitted to the
discipline of a weather-cock, before the Quarters were made. In the
street, with the blended noises of life about me, I hear, and my head is
lightened, but in a room the hubbub comes back, and I am deaf as a
Sinner. Did I tell you of a pleasant sketch Hood has done, which he
calls <emphasis>Very Deaf Indeed</emphasis>? It is of a good naturd stupid looking old
gentleman, whom a footpad has stopt, but for his extreme deafness cannot
make him understand what he wants; the unconscious old gentleman is
extending his ear-trumpet very complacently, and the fellow is firing a
pistol into it to make him hear, but the ball will pierce his skull
sooner than the report reach his sensorium. I chuse a very little bit of
paper, for my ear hisses when I bend down to write. I can hardly read a
book, for I miss that small soft voice which the idea of articulated
words raises (almost imperceptibly to you) in a silent reader. I seem
too deaf to see what I read. But with a touch or two of returning Zephyr
my head will melt. What Lyes you Poets tell about the May! It is the
most ungenial part of the Year, cold crocuses, cold primroses, you take
your blossoms in Ice —a painted Sun—</p>

winds have blowd <emphasis>over</emphasis> you, as they do thro' me. Kindest rememb'ces to

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO S.T. COLERIDGE</strong></p>
<p>June 1st, 1826.</p>
<p>Dear Coleridge,—If I know myself, nobody more detests the display of
personal vanity which is implied in the act of sitting for one's picture
than myself. But the fact is, that the likeness which accompanies this
letter was stolen from my person at one of my unguarded moments by some
too partial artist, and my friends are pleased to think that he has not
much flattered me. Whatever its merits may be, you, who have so great an
interest in the original, will have a satisfaction in tracing the
features of one that has so long esteemed you. There are times when in a
friend's absence these graphic representations of him almost seem to
bring back the man himself. The painter, whoever he was, seems to have
taken me in one of those disengaged moments, if I may so term them, when
the native character is so much more honestly displayed than can be
possible in the restraints of an enforced sitting attitude. Perhaps it
rather describes me as a thinking man than a man in the act of thought.
Whatever its pretensions, I know it will be dear to you, towards whom I
should wish my thoughts to flow in a sort of an undress rather than in
the more studied graces of diction.</p>
<p>               I am, dear Coleridge, yours sincerely,            C. LAMB.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN BATES DIBDIN</strong></p>
<p>Friday, someday in June, 1826. [P.M. June 30, 1826.]</p>
<p>Dear D.—My first impulse upon opening your letter was pleasure at
seeing your old neat hand, nine parts gentlemanly, with a modest dash of
the clerical: my second a Thought, natural enough this hot weather, Am I
to answer all this? why 'tis as long as those to the Ephesians and
Galatians put together—I have counted the words for curiosity. But then
Paul has nothing like the fun which is ebullient all over yours. I don't
remember a good thing (good like yours) from the 1st Romans to the last
of the Hebrews. I remember but one Pun in all the Evangely, and that was
made by his and our master: Thou art Peter (that is Doctor Rock) and
upon this rock will I build &amp;c.; which sanctifies Punning with me
against all gainsayers. I never knew an enemy to puns, who was not an
ill-natured man.</p>
<p>Your fair critic in the coach reminds me of a Scotchman who assured me
that he did not see much in Shakspeare. I replied, I dare say <emphasis>not</emphasis>. He
felt the equivoke, lookd awkward, and reddish, but soon returnd to the
attack, by saying that he thought Burns was as good as Shakspeare: I
said that I had no doubt he was—to a <emphasis>Scotchman</emphasis>. We exchangd no more
words that day.—Your account of the fierce faces in the Hanging, with
the presumed interlocution of the Eagle and the Tyger, amused us
greatly. You cannot be so very bad, while you can pick mirth off from
rotten walls. But let me hear you have escaped out of your oven. May the
Form of the Fourth Person who clapt invisible wet blankets about the
shoulders of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego, be with you in the fiery
Trial. But get out of the frying pan. Your business, I take it, is
bathing, not baking.</p>
<p>Let me hear that you have clamber'd up to Lover's Seat; it is as fine in
that neighbourhood as Juan Fernandez, as lonely too, when the Fishing
boats are not out; I have sat for hours, staring upon a shipless sea.
The salt sea is never so grand as when it is left to itself. One
cock-boat spoils it. A sea-mew or two improves it. And go to the little
church, which is a very protestant Loretto, and seems dropt by some
angel for the use of a hermit, who was at once parishioner and a whole
parish. It is not too big. Go in the night, bring it away in your
portmanteau, and I will plant it in my garden. It must have been erected
in the very infancy of British Christianity, for the two or three first
converts; yet hath it all the appertenances of a church of the first
magnitude, its pulpit, its pews, its baptismal font; a cathedral in a
nutshell. Seven people would crowd it like a Caledonian Chapel. The
minister that divides the word there, must give lumping penny-worths. It
is built to the text of two or three assembled in my name. It reminds me
of the grain of mustard seed. If the glebe land is proportionate, it may
yield two potatoes. Tythes out of it could be no more split than a hair.
Its First fruits must be its Last, for 'twould never produce a couple.
It is truly the strait and narrow way, and few there be (of London
visitants) that find it. The still small voice is surely to be found
there, if any where. A sounding board is merely there for ceremony. It
is secure from earthquakes, not more from sanctity than size, for
'twould feel a mountain thrown upon it no more than a taper-worm would.
Go and see, but not without your spectacles. By the way, there's a
capital farm house two thirds of the way to the Lover's Seat, with
incomparable plum cake, ginger beer, etc. Mary bids me warn you not to
read the Anatomy of Melancholy in your present <emphasis>low way</emphasis>. You'll fancy
yourself a pipkin, or a headless bear, as Burton speaks of. You'll be
lost in a maze of remedies for a labyrinth of diseasements, a plethora
of cures. Read Fletcher; above all the Spanish Curate, the Thief or
Little Nightwalker, the Wit Without Money, and the Lover's Pilgrimage.
Laugh and come home fat. Neither do we think Sir T. Browne quite the
thing for you just at present. Fletcher is as light as Soda water.
Browne and Burton are too strong potions for an Invalid. And don't thumb
or dirt the books. Take care of the bindings. Lay a leaf of silver paper
under 'em, as you read them. And don't smoke tobacco over 'em, the
leaves will fall in and burn or dirty their namesakes. If you find any
dusty atoms of the Indian Weed crumbled up in the Beaum't and Fletcher,
they are <emphasis>mine</emphasis>. But then, you know, so is the Folio also. A pipe and a
comedy of Fletcher's the last thing of a night is the best recipe for
light dreams and to scatter away Nightmares. Probatum est. But do as you
like about the former. Only cut the Baker's. You will come home else all
crust; Rankings must chip you before you can appear in his counting
house. And my dear Peter Fin Junr., do contrive to see the sea at least
once before you return. You'll be ask'd about it in the Old Jewry. It
will appear singular not to have seen it. And rub up your Muse, the
family Muse, and send us a rhyme or so. Don't waste your wit upon that
damn'd Dry Salter. I never knew but one Dry Salter, who could relish
those mellow effusions, and he broke. You knew Tommy Hill, the wettest
of dry salters. Dry Salters, what a word for this thirsty weather! I
must drink after it. Here's to thee, my dear Dibdin, and to our having
you again snug and well at Colebrooke. But our nearest hopes are to hear
again from you shortly. An epistle only a quarter as agreeable as your
last, would be a treat.</p>

<p>[Dibdin must have sent the verses which Lamb asked for in the previous
letter, and this is Lamb's reply. Pride of ancestry seems to have been
the note of Dibdin's effort. Probably there is a certain amount of truth
in Lamb's account of the resolute merriment of his father. It is not
inconsistent with his description of Lovel in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "The Old
Benchers of the Inner Temple."</p>
<p>"I have stol'n a quip." The manner rather than the precise matter, I
think.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to the Rev. Edward Coleridge,
Coleridge's nephew, dated July 19, 1826. It thanks the recipient for his
kindness to the child of a friend of Lamb's, Samuel Anthony Bloxam,
Coleridge having assisted in getting Frederick Bloxam into Eton (where
he was a master) on the foundation. Samuel Bloxam and Lamb were at
Christ's Hospital together.]</p>

<p>LETTER 399</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. September 6, 1826.]</p>
<p>My dear Wordsworth, The Bearer of this is my young friend Moxon, a
young lad with a Yorkshire head, and a heart that would do honour to a
more Southern county: no offence to Westmoreland. He is one of Longman's
best hands, and can give you the best account of The Trade as 'tis now
going; or stopping. For my part, the failure of a Bookseller is not the
most unpalatable accident of mortality:</p>
<p>            sad but not saddest
        The desolation of a hostile city.</p>
<p>When Constable fell from heaven, and we all hoped Baldwin was next, I
tuned a slight stave to the words in Macbeth (D'avenant's) to be sung by
a Chorus of Authors,</p>
<p>        What should we do when Booksellers break?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        We should rejoyce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Moxon is but a tradesman in the bud yet, and retains his virgin Honesty;
Esto perpetua, for he is a friendly serviceable fellow, and thinks
nothing of lugging up a Cargo of the Newest Novels once or twice a week
from the Row to Colebrooke to gratify my Sister's passion for the newest
things. He is her Bodley. He is author besides of a poem which for a
first attempt is promising. It is made up of common images, and yet
contrives to read originally. You see the writer felt all he pours
forth, and has not palmed upon you expressions which he did not believe
at the time to be more his own than adoptive. Rogers has paid him some
proper compliments, with sound advice intermixed, upon a slight
introduction of him by me; for which I feel obliged. Moxon has
petition'd me by letter (for he had not the confidence to ask it in
London) to introduce him to you during his holydays; pray pat him on the
head, ask him a civil question or two about his verses, and favor him
with your genuine autograph. He shall not be further troublesome. I
think I have not sent any one upon a gaping mission to you a good while.
We are all well, and I have at last broke the bonds of business a second
time, never to put 'em on again. I pitch Colburn and his magazine to the
divil. I find I can live without the necessity of writing, tho' last
year I fretted myself to a fever with the hauntings of being starved.
Those vapours are flown. All the difference I find is that I have no
pocket money: that is, I must not pry upon an old book stall, and cull
its contents as heretofore, but shoulders of mutton, Whitbread's entire,
and Booth's best, abound as formerly.</p>
<p>I don't know whom or how many to send our love to, your household is so
frequently divided, but a general health to all that may be fixed or
wandering; stars, wherever. We read with pleasure some success (I forget
quite what) of one of you at Oxford. Mrs. Monkhouse (… was one of you)
sent us a kind letter some [months back], and we had the pleasure to
[see] her in tolerable spirits, looking well and kind as in by-gone
days.</p>
<p>Do take pen, or put it into goodnatured hands Dorothean
or Wordsworthian-female, or Hutchinsonian, to inform us of
your present state, or possible proceedings. I am ashamed
that this breaking of the long ice should be a letter of business.
There is none circum praecordia nostra I swear by the honesty
of pedantry, that wil I nil I pushes me upon scraps of Latin.
We are yours cordially:                         CHAS. &amp; MARY LAMB.</p>

<p>[In this letter, the first to Wordsworth for many months, we have the
first mention of Edward Moxon, who was to be so closely associated with
Lamb in the years to come. Moxon, a young Yorkshireman, educated at the
Green Coat School, was then nearly twenty-five, and was already author
of <emphasis>The Prospect and other Poems</emphasis>, dedicated to Rogers, who was destined
to be a valuable patron. Moxon subsequently became Wordsworth's
publisher.</p>
<p>"Constable … Baldwin." Archibald Constable &amp; Co., Scott's publishers,

<p>An answer is requested.</p>
<p>Saturday.</p>
<p>Dear D.—I have observed that a Letter is never more acceptable than
when received upon a rainy day, especially a rainy Sunday; which moves
me to send you somewhat, however short. This will find you sitting after
Breakfast, which you will have prolonged as far as you can with
consistency to the poor handmaid that has the reversion of the Tea
Leaves; making two nibbles of your last morsel of <emphasis>stale</emphasis> roll (you
cannot have hot new ones on the Sabbath), and reluctantly coming to an
end, because when that is done, what can you do till dinner? You cannot
go to the Beach, for the rain is drowning the sea, turning rank Thetis
fresh, taking the brine out of Neptune's pickles, while mermaids sit
upon rocks with umbrellas, their ivory combs sheathed for spoiling in
the wet of waters foreign to them. You cannot go to the library, for
it's shut. You are not religious enough to go to church. O it is worth
while to cultivate piety to the gods, to have something to fill the
heart up on a wet Sunday! You cannot cast accounts, for your ledger is
being eaten up with moths in the Ancient Jewry. You cannot play at
draughts, for there is none to play with you, and besides there is not a
draught board in the house. You cannot go to market, for it closed last
night. You cannot look in to the shops, their backs are shut upon you.
You cannot read the Bible, for it is not good reading for the sick and
the hypochondriacal. You cannot while away an hour with a friend, for
you have no friend round that Wrekin. You cannot divert yourself with a
stray acquaintance, for you have picked none up. You cannot bear the
chiming of Bells, for they invite you to a banquet, where you are no
visitant. You cannot cheer yourself with the prospect of a tomorrow's
letter, for none come on Mondays. You cannot count those endless vials
on the mantlepiece with any hope of making a variation in their numbers.
You have counted your spiders: your Bastile is exhausted. You sit and
deliberately curse your hard exile from all familiar sights and sounds.
Old Ranking poking in his head unexpectedly would just now be as good to
you as Grimaldi. Any thing to deliver you from this intolerable weight
of Ennui. You are too ill to shake it off: not ill enough to submit to
it, and to lie down as a lamb under it. The Tyranny of Sickness is
nothing to the Cruelty of Convalescence: 'tis to have Thirty Tyrants for
one. That pattering rain drops on your brain. You'll be worse after
dinner, for you must dine at one to-day, that Betty may go to afternoon
service. She insists upon having her chopped hay. And then when she goes
out, who <emphasis>was</emphasis> something to you, something to speak to—what an
interminable afternoon you'll have to go thro'. You can't break yourself
from your locality: you cannot say "Tomorrow morning I set off for
Banstead, by God": for you are book'd for Wednesday. Foreseeing this, I
thought a <emphasis>cheerful letter</emphasis> would come in opportunely. If any of the
little topics for mirth I have thought upon should serve you in this
utter extinguishment of sunshine, to make you a little merry, I shall
have had my ends. I love to make things comfortable. [<emphasis>Here is an
erasure.</emphasis>] This, which is scratch'd out was the most material thing I
had to say, but on maturer thoughts I defer it.</p>
<p>P.S.—We are just sitting down to dinner with a pleasant party,
Coleridge, Reynolds the dramatist, and Sam Bloxam: to-morrow (that is,
to_day_), Liston, and Wyat of the Wells, dine with us. May this find you
as jolly and freakish as we mean to be.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. September 26, 1826.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I don't know why I have delay'd so long writing. 'Twas a
fault. The under current of excuse to my mind was that I had heard of
the Vessel in which Mitford's jars were to come; that it had been
obliged to put into Batavia to refit (which accounts for its delay) but
was daily expectated. Days are past, and it comes not, and the mermaids
may be drinking their Tea out of his China for ought I know; but let's
hope not. In the meantime I have paid £28, etc., for the freight and
prime cost, (which I a little expected he would have settled in London.)
But do not mention it. I was enabled to do it by a receipt of £30 from
Colburn, with whom however I have done. I should else have run short.
For I just make ends meet. We will wait the arrival of the Trinkets, and
to ascertain their full expence, and then bring in the bill. (Don't
mention it, for I daresay 'twas mere thoughtlessness.)</p>
<p>I am sorry you and yours have any plagues about dross matters. I have
been sadly puzzled at the defalcation of more than one third of my
income, out of which when entire I saved nothing. But cropping off wine,
old books, &amp;c. and in short all that can be call'd pocket money, I hope
to be able to go on at the Cottage. Remember, I beg you not to say
anything to Mitford, for if he be honest it will vex him: if not, which
I as little expect as that you should [not] be, I have a hank still upon
the JARS.</p>
<p>Colburn had something of mine in last month, which he has had in hand
these 7 months, and had lost, or cou'dnt find room for: I was used to
different treatment in the London, and have forsworn Periodicals.</p>
<p>I am going thro' a course of reading at the Museum: the Garrick plays,
out of part of which I formed my Specimens: I have Two Thousand to go
thro'; and in a few weeks have despatch'd the tythe of 'em. It is a sort
of Office to me; hours, 10 to 4, the same. It does me good. Man must
have regular occupation, that has been used to it. So A.K. keeps a
School! She teaches nothing wrong, I'll answer for't. I have a Dutch
print of a Schoolmistress; little old-fashioned Fleminglings, with only
one face among them. She a Princess of Schoolmistress, wielding a rod
for form more than use; the scene an old monastic chapel, with a Madonna
over her head, looking just as serious, as thoughtful, as pure, as
gentle, as herself. Tis a type of thy friend.</p>
<p>Will you pardon my neglect? Mind, again I say, don't shew this to M.;
let me wait a little longer to know the event of his Luxuries. (I am
sure he is a good fellow, tho' I made a serious Yorkshire Lad, who met
him, stare when I said he was a Clergyman. He is a pleasant Layman
spoiled.) Heaven send him his jars uncrack'd, and me my—— Yours with

haunted me, only the Cramp, Caliban's distemper, clawing me in the
calvish part of my nature, makes me ever and anon roar Bullishly, squeak
cowardishly, and limp cripple-ishly. Do I write quakerly and simply,
'tis my most Master Mathew-like intention to do it. See Ben Jonson.—I
think you told me your acquaint'ce with the Drama was confin'd to
Shakspeare and Miss Bailly: some read only Milton and Croly. The gap is
as from an ananas to a Turnip. I have fighting in my head the plots
characters situations and sentiments of 400 old Plays (bran new to me)
which I have been digesting at the Museum, and my appetite sharpens to
twice as many more, which I mean to course over this winter. I can
scarce avoid Dialogue fashion in this letter. I soliloquise my
meditations, and habitually speak dramatic blank verse without meaning
it. Do you see Mitford? he will tell you something of my labors. Tell
him I am sorry to have mist seeing him, to have talk'd over those OLD
TREASURES. I am still more sorry for his missing Pots. But I shall be
sure of the earliest intelligence of the Lost Tribes. His Sacred
Specimens are a thankful addition to my shelves. Marry, I could wish he
had been more careful of corrigenda. I have discover'd certain which
have slipt his Errata. I put 'em in the next page, as perhaps thou canst
transmit them to him. For what purpose, but to grieve him (which yet I
should be sorry to do), but then it shews my learning, and the excuse is
complimentary, as it implies their correction in a future Edition. His
own things in the book are magnificent, and as an old Christ's
Hospitaller I was particularly refreshd with his eulogy on our Edward.
Many of the choice excerpta were new to me. Old Christmas is a coming,
to the confusion of Puritans, Muggletonians, Anabaptists, Quakers, and

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO HENRY CRABB ROBINSON</strong></p>
<p>Colebrooke Row, Islington,</p>
<p>Saturday, 20th Jan., 1827.</p>
<p>Dear Robinson,—I called upon you this morning, and found that you were
gone to visit a dying friend. I had been upon a like errand. Poor Norris
has been lying dying for now almost a week, such is the penalty we pay
for having enjoyed a strong constitution! Whether he knew me or not, I
know not, or whether he saw me through his poor glazed eyes; but the
group I saw about him I shall not forget. Upon the bed, or about it,
were assembled his wife and two daughters, and poor deaf Richard, his
son, looking doubly stupified. There they were, and seemed to have been
sitting all the week. I could only reach out a hand to Mrs. Norris.
Speaking was impossible in that mute chamber. By this time I hope it is
all over with him. In him I have a loss the world cannot make up. He was
my friend and my father's friend all the life I can remember. I seem to
have made foolish friendships ever since. Those are friendships which
outlive a second generation. Old as I am waxing, in his eyes I was still
the child he first knew me. To the last he called me Charley. I have
none to call me Charley now. He was the last link that bound me to the
Temple. You are but of yesterday. In him seem to have died the old
plainness of manners and singleness of heart. Letters he knew nothing
of, nor did his reading extend beyond the pages of the "Gentleman's
Magazine." Yet there was a pride of literature about him from being
amongst books (he was librarian), and from some scraps of doubtful Latin
which he had picked up in his office of entering students, that gave him
very diverting airs of pedantry. Can I forget the erudite look with
which, when he had been in vain trying to make out a black-letter text
of Chaucer in the Temple Library, he laid it down and told me that—"in
those old books, Charley, there is sometimes a deal of very indifferent
spelling;" and seemed to console himself in the reflection! His jokes,
for he had his jokes, are now ended, but they were old trusty
perennials, staples that pleased after <emphasis>decies repetita</emphasis>, and were
always as good as new. One song he had, which was reserved for the night
of Christmas-day, which we always spent in the Temple. It was an old
thing, and spoke of the flat bottoms of our foes and the possibility of
their coming over in darkness, and alluded to threats of an invasion
many years blown over; and when he came to the part</p>
<p>        "We'll still make 'em run, and we'll still make 'em sweat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In spite of the devil and Brussels Gazette!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>his eyes would sparkle as with the freshness of an impending event. And
what is the "Brussels Gazette" now? I cry while I enumerate these
trifles. "How shall we tell them in a stranger's ear?" His poor good
girls will now have to receive their afflicted mother in an inaccessible
hovel in an obscure village in Herts, where they have been long
struggling to make a school without effect; and poor deaf Richard—and
the more helpless for being so—is thrown on the wide world.</p>
<p>My first motive in writing, and, indeed, in calling on you, was to ask
if you were enough acquainted with any of the Benchers, to lay a plain
statement before them of the circumstances of the family. I almost fear
not, for you are of another hall. But if you can oblige me and my poor
friend, who is now insensible to any favours, pray exert yourself. You
cannot say too much good of poor Norris and his poor wife.</p>

alterations in Hone's <emphasis>Table Book</emphasis>, 1827, and again in the <emphasis>Last Essays
of Elia</emphasis>, 1833, under the title "A Death-Bed." It was, however, taken
out of the second edition, and "Confessions of a Drunkard" substituted,
in deference to the wishes of Norris's family. Mrs. Norris, as I have
said, was a native of Widford, where she had known Mrs. Field, Lamb's
grandmother. With her son Richard, who was deaf and peculiar, Mrs.
Norris moved to Widford again, where the daughters, Miss Betsy and Miss
Jane, had opened a school—Goddard House; which they retained until a
legacy restored the family prosperity. Soon after that they both
married, each a farmer named Tween. They survived until quite recently.</p>
<p>Mrs. Coe, an old scholar at the Misses Morris's school in the twenties,
gave me, in 1902, some reminiscences of those days, from which I quote a
passage or so:—</p>
<p>    When he joined the Norrises' dinner-table he kept every one
    laughing. Mr. Richard sat at one end, and some of the school
    children would be there too. One day Mr. Lamb gave every one a fancy
    name all round the table, and made a verse on each. "You are
    so-and-so," he said, "and you are so-and-so," adding the rhyme.
    "What's he saying? What are you laughing at?" Mr. Richard asked
    testily, for he was short-tempered. Miss Betsy explained the joke to
    him, and Mr. Lamb, coming to his turn, said—only he said it in
    verse—"Now, Dick, it's your turn. I shall call you Gruborum;
    because all you think of is your food and your stomach." Mr. Richard
    pushed back his chair in a rage and stamped out of the room. "Now
    I've done it," said Mr. Lamb: "I must go and make friends with my
    old chum. Give me a large plate of pudding to take to him." When he
    came back he said, "It's all right. I thought the pudding would do
    it." Mr. Lamb and Mr. Richard never got on very well, and Mr.
    Richard didn't like his teasing ways at all; but Mr. Lamb often went
    for long walks with him, because no one else would. He did many kind
    things like that.</p>
<p>    There used to be a half-holiday when Mr. Lamb came, partly because
    he would force his way into the schoolroom and make seriousness
    impossible. His head would suddenly appear at the door in the midst
    of lessons, with "Well, Betsy! How do, Jane?" "O, Mr. Lamb!" they
    would say, and that was the end of work for that day. He was really
    rather naughty with the children. One of his tricks was to teach
    them a new kind of catechism (Mrs. Coe does not remember it, but we
    may rest assured, I fear, that it was secular), and he made a great
    fuss with Lizzie Hunt for her skill in saying the Lord's Prayer
    backwards, which he had taught her.</p>

<p>Dear R.N. is dead. I have writ as nearly as I could to look like a

<p>Could you distantly hint (do as your own judgment suggests) that if his

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO HENRY CRABB ROBINSON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated by H.C.R. Jan. 29, 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear Robinson, If you have not seen Mr. Gurney, leave him quite alone
for the present, I have seen Mr. Jekyll, who is as friendly as heart can
desire, he entirely approves of my formula of petition, and gave your
very reasons for the propriety of the "little village of Hertf'shire."
Now, Mr. G. might not approve of it, and then we should clash. Also, Mr.
J. wishes it to be presented next week, and Mr. G. might fix earlier,
which would be aukward. Mr. J. was so civil to me, that I <emphasis>think it
would be better NOT for you to show him that letter you intended</emphasis>.
Nothing can increase his zeal in the cause of poor Mr. Norris. Mr.
Gardiner will see you with this, and learn from you all about it, &amp;
consult, if you have seen Mr. G. &amp; he has fixed a time, how to put it
off. Mr. J. is most friendly to the boy: I think you had better not
teaze the Treasurer any more about <emphasis>him</emphasis>, as it may make him less
friendly to the Petition</p>
<p>Yours Ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C.L.</strong></p>

<p>[Writing to Dorothy Wordsworth on February 13, 1827, Robinson says: "The</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>Gurney would probably be John Gurney (afterwards Baron Gurney), the
counsel and judge. Jekyll was Joseph Jekyll, the wit, mentioned by Lamb
in his essay on "The Old Benchers of the Inner Temple." He was a friend
of George Dyer.]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO HENRY CRABB ROBINSON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated by H.C. R. Jan., 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear R. do not say any thing to Mr. G. about the day <emphasis>or</emphasis> Petition, for
Mr. Jekyll wishes it to be next week, and thoroughly approves of my
formula, and Mr. G. might not, and then they will clash. Only speak to
him of Gardner's wish to have the Lad. Mr. Jekyll was excessive
friendly.                              C.L.</p>

<p>[The matter referred to is still the Norrises' welfare. Mr. Hazlitt says
that an annuity of £80 was settled by the Inn on Mrs. Norris.</p>
<p>Here perhaps should come a letter from Lamb to Allsop, printed by Mr.
Fitzgerald, urging Allsop to go to Highgate to see Coleridge and tell
him of the unhappy state of his, Allsop's, affairs. In Crabb Robinson's
<emphasis>Diary</emphasis> for February 1, 1827, I read: "I went to Lamb. Found him in
trouble about his friend Allsop, who is a ruined man. Allsop is a very
good creature who has been a generous friend to Coleridge." Writing of
his troubles in <emphasis>Letters, Conversations and Recollections of S.T.
Coleridge</emphasis>, Allsop says: "Charles Lamb, Charles and Mary Lamb, 'union is
partition,' were never wanting in the hour of need."]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.R. HAYDON</strong></p>
<p>[March, 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear Raffaele Haydon,—Did the maid tell you I came to see your picture,
not on Sunday but the day before? I think the face and bearing of the
Bucephalus-tamer very noble, his flesh too effeminate or painty. The
skin of the female's back kneeling is much more carnous. I had small
time to pick out praise or blame, for two lord-like Bucks came in, upon
whose strictures my presence seemed to impose restraint: I plebeian'd
off therefore.</p>
<p>I think I have hit on a subject for you, but can't swear it was never
executed,—I never heard of its being,—"Chaucer beating a Franciscan
Friar in Fleet Street." Think of the old dresses, houses, &amp;c. "It
seemeth that both these learned men (Gower and Chaucer) were of the
Inner Temple; for not many years since Master Buckley did see a record
in the same house where Geoffry Chaucer was fined two shillings for
beating a Franciscan Friar in Fleet Street." <emphasis>Chaucer's Life by T.
Speght, prefixed to the black letter folio of Chaucer</emphasis>, 1598.</p>

tells us in his <emphasis>Diary</emphasis>, were the Duke of Devonshire and Mr. Agar Ellis.

<p>LETTER 412</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[No date. (1827.)]</p>
<p>My dear B.B.—A gentleman I never saw before brought me your welcome
present—imagine a scraping, fiddling, fidgetting, petit-maitre of a
dancing school advancing into my plain parlour with a coupee and a
sideling bow, and presenting the book as if he had been handing a glass
of lemonade to a young miss—imagine this, and contrast it with the
serious nature of the book presented! Then task your imagination,
reversing this picture, to conceive of quite an opposite messenger, a
lean, straitlocked, wheyfaced methodist, for such was he in reality who
brought it, the Genius (it seems) of the Wesleyan Magazine. Certes,
friend B., thy Widow's tale is too horrible, spite of the lenitives of
Religion, to embody in verse: I hold prose to be the appropriate
expositor of such atrocities! No offence, but it is a cordial that makes
the heart sick. Still thy skill in compounding it I not deny. I turn to
what gave me less mingled pleasure. I find markd with pencil these pages
in thy pretty book, and fear I have been penurious.</p>
<p>      page 52, 53 capital.
      page     59 6th stanza exquisite simile.
      page     61 11th stanza equally good.
      page     108 3d stanza, I long to see van Balen.
      page     111 a downright good sonnet. <emphasis>Dixi</emphasis>.
      page     153 Lines at the bottom.</p>
<p>So you see, I read, hear, and <emphasis>mark</emphasis>, if I don't learn—In short this
little volume is no discredit to any of your former, and betrays none of
the Senility you fear about. Apropos of Van Balen, an artist who painted
me lately had painted a Blackamoor praying, and not filling his canvas,
stuff'd in his little girl aside of Blacky, gaping at him unmeaningly;
and then didn't know what to call it. Now for a picture to be promoted
to the Exhibition (Suffolk Street) as HISTORICAL, a subject is
requisite. What does me? I but christen it the "Young Catechist" and
furbishd it with Dialogue following, which dubb'd it an Historical
Painting. Nothing to a friend at need.</p>
<p>        While this tawny Ethiop prayeth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Painter, who is She that stayeth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        By, with skin of whitest lustre;</p>
<empty-line/>

        Is she of the heav'nborn Three,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Meek Hope, strong Faith, sweet Charity?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or some Cherub?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          They you mention</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Far transcend my weak invention.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Tis a simple Christian child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Missionary young and mild,</p>

        From her store of script'ral knowledge</p>

        (Bible-taught without a college)</p>

<p>When I'd done it, the Artist (who had clapt in Miss merely as a
fill-space) swore I exprest his full meaning, and the damosel bridled up
into a Missionary's vanity. I like verses to explain Pictures: seldom
Pictures to illustrate Poems. Your wood cut is a rueful Lignum Mortis.
By the by, is the widow likely to marry again?</p>
<p>I am giving the fruit of my Old Play reading at the Museum to Hone, who
sets forth a Portion weekly in the Table Book. Do you see it? How is
Mitford?—</p>
<p>I'll just hint that the Pitcher, the Chord and the Bowl are a little too
often repeated (<emphasis>passim</emphasis>) in your Book, and that on page 17 last line
but 4 <emphasis>him</emphasis> is put for <emphasis>he</emphasis>, but the poor widow I take it had small
leisure for grammatical niceties. Don't you see there's <emphasis>He, myself</emphasis>,
and <emphasis>him</emphasis>; why not both <emphasis>him</emphasis>? likewise <emphasis>imperviously</emphasis> is cruelly spelt
<emphasis>imperiously</emphasis>. These are trifles, and I honestly like your [book,] and
you for giving it, tho' I really am ashamed of so many presents.</p>
<p>I can think of no news, therefore I will end with mine and Mary's
kindest remembrances to you and yours.                           C.L.</p>

<p>[It has been customary to date this letter December, 1827, but I think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

that must be too late. Lamb would never have waited till then to tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Barton that he was contributing the Garrick Plays to Hone's <emphasis>Table</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>

Book</emphasis>, especially as the last instalment was printed in that month.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Barton's new volume was <emphasis>A Widow's Tale and Other Poems</emphasis>, 1827. The
title poem tells how a missionary and his wife were wrecked, and how
after three nights and days of horror she was saved. The woodcut on the
title-page of Barton's book represented the widow supporting her dead or
dying husband in the midst of the storm.</p>
<p>This is the "exquisite simile" on page 59, from "A Grandsire's Tale":—</p>
<p>        Though some might deem her pensive, if not sad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Yet those who knew her better, best could tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        How calmly happy, and how meekly glad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Her quiet heart in its own depths did dwell:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Like to the waters of some crystal well,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In which the stars of heaven at noon are seen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Fancy might deem on her young spirit fell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Glimpses of light more glorious and serene</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Than that of life's brief day, so heavenly was her mien.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This was the "downright good sonnet":—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>        TO A GRANDMOTHER</strong></p>
<p>             "Old age is dark and unlovely."—Ossian.</p>
<p>        O say not so! A bright old age is thine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Calm as the gentle light of summer eves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Ere twilight dim her dusky mantle weaves;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Because to thee is given, in strength's decline,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A heart that does not thanklessly repine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          At aught of which the hand of God bereaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Yet all He sends with gratitude receives;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        May such a quiet, thankful close be mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And hence thy fire-side chair appears to me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A peaceful throne—which thou wert form'd to fill;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Thy children—ministers, who do thy will;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And those grand-children, sporting round thy knee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thy little subjects, looking up to thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          As one who claims their fond allegiance still.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And these are the lines at the foot of page 153 in a poem addressed to a
child seven years old:—</p>
<p>        There is a holy, blest companionship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In the sweet intercourse thus held with those</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whose tear and smile are guileless; from whose lip</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The simple dictate of the heart yet flows;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Though even in the yet unfolded rose</p>
<empty-line/>

          The worm may lurk, and sin blight blooming youth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The light born with us long so brightly glows,</p>
<empty-line/>

          That childhood's first deceits seem almost truth,</p>

          To life's cold after lie, selfish, and void of ruth.</p>

and for which he expressed his thanks in a poem.</p>

portrait being that which serves as frontispiece to this volume. I give

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, and for some weeks to come, "<emphasis>June 11, 1827</emphasis>."</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—One word more of the picture verses, and that for good and
all; pray, with a neat pen alter one line</p>
<p>        His learning seems to lay small stress on</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>        His learning lays no mighty stress on</p>
<p>to avoid the unseemly recurrence (ungrammatical also) of "seems" in the
next line, besides the nonsence of "but" there, as it now stands. And I
request you, as a personal favor to me, to erase the last line of all,
which I should never have written from myself. The fact is, it was a
silly joke of Hood's, who gave me the frame, (you judg'd rightly it was
not its own) with the remark that you would like it, because it was b—d
b—d,—and I lugg'd it in: but I shall be quite hurt if it stands,
because tho' you and yours have too good sense to object to it, I would
not have a sentence of mine seen, that to any foolish ear might sound
unrespectful to thee. Let it end at appalling; the joke is coarse and
useless, and hurts the tone of the rest. Take your best "ivory-handled"
and scrape it forth.</p>
<p>Your specimen of what you might have written is hardly fair. Had it been
a present to me, I should have taken a more sentimental tone; but of a
trifle from me it was my cue to speak in an underish tone of
commendation. Prudent <emphasis>givers</emphasis> (what a word for such a nothing)
disparage their gifts; 'tis an art we have. So you see you wouldn't have
been so wrong, taking a higher tone. But enough of nothing.</p>
<p>By the bye, I suspected M. of being the disparager of the frame; hence a
<emphasis>certain line</emphasis>.</p>
<p>For the frame,'tis as the room is, where it hangs. It hung up fronting
my old cobwebby folios and batter'd furniture (the fruit piece has
resum'd its place) and was much better than a spick and span one. But if
your room be very neat and your <emphasis>other pictures</emphasis> bright with gilt, it
should be so too. I can't judge, not having seen: but my dingy study it
suited.</p>
<p>Martin's Belshazzar (the picture) I have seen. Its architectural effect
is stupendous; but the human figures, the squalling contorted little
antics that are playing at being frightend, like children at a sham
ghost who half know it to be a mask, are detestable. Then the <emphasis>letters</emphasis>
are nothing more than a transparency lighted up, such as a Lord might
order to be lit up, on a sudden at a Xmas Gambol, to scare the ladies.
The <emphasis>type</emphasis> is as plain as Baskervil's—they should have been dim, full
of mystery, letters to the mind rather than the eye.—Rembrandt has
painted only Belshazzar and a courtier or two (taking a part of the
banquet for the whole) not fribbled out a mob of fine folks. Then every
thing is so distinct, to the very necklaces, and that foolish little
prophet. What <emphasis>one</emphasis> point is there of interest? The ideal of such a
subject is, that you the spectator should see nothing but what at the
time you would have seen, the <emphasis>hand</emphasis>—and the <emphasis>King</emphasis>—not to be at
leisure to make taylor-remarks on the dresses, or Doctor Kitchener-like
to examine the good things at table.</p>
<p>Just such a confusd piece is his Joshua, fritterd into 1000 fragments,
little armies here, little armies there—you should see only the <emphasis>Sun</emphasis>
and <emphasis>Joshua</emphasis>; if I remember, he has not left out that luminary entirely,
but for Joshua, I was ten minutes a finding him out.</p>
<p>Still he is showy in all that is not the human figure or the
preternatural interest: but the first are below a drawing school girl's
attainment, and the last is a phantasmagoric trick, "Now you shall see
what you shall see, dare is Balshazar and dare is Daniel." You have my
thoughts of M. and so adieu                     C. LAMB.</p>

<p>[Lamb had sent Barton the picture that is reproduced in Vol. V. of my
large edition. Later Lamb had sent the following lines:—</p>
<p>        When last you left your Woodbridge pretty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To stare at sights, and see the City,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        If I your meaning understood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        You wish'd a Picture, cheap, but good;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The colouring? decent; clear, not muddy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To suit a Poet's quiet study,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where Books and Prints for delectation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hang, rather than vain ostentation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The subject? what I pleased, if comely;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But something scriptural and homely:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A sober Piece, not gay or wanton,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For winter fire-sides to descant on;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The theme so scrupulously handled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A Quaker might look on unscandal'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Such as might satisfy Ann Knight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And classic Mitford just not fright.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Just such a one I've found, and send it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        If liked, I give—if not, but lend it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The moral? nothing can be sounder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The fable? 'tis its own expounder—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A Mother teaching to her Chit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Some good book, and explaining it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He, silly urchin, tired of lesson,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His learning seems to lay small stress on,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But seems to hear not what he hears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thrusting his fingers in his ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Like Obstinate, that perverse funny one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In honest parable of Bunyan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His working Sister, more sedate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Listens; but in a kind of state,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The painter meant for steadiness;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But has a tinge of sullenness;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And, at first sight, she seems to brook</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As ill her needle, as he his book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        This is the Picture. For the Frame—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Tis not ill-suited to the same;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Oak-carved, not gilt, for fear of falling;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Old-fashion'd; plain, yet not appalling;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And broad brimm'd, as the Owner's Calling.</p>

<p>It was not Obstinate, by the way, who thrust his fingers in his ears,
but Christian.</p>

<p>Martin's "Belshazzar." "Belshazzar's Feast," by John Martin (1789-1854),
had been exhibited for some years and had created an immense impression.
Lamb subjected Martin's work to a minute analysis a few years later (see
the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on the "Barrenness of the Imaginative Faculty in the
Productions of Modern Art," Vol. II.). Barton did not give up Martin in
consequence of this letter. The frontispiece to his <emphasis>New Year's Eve</emphasis>,
1828, is by that painter, and the volume contains eulogistic poems upon
him, one beginning—</p>

<p>Dear H.C. We are at Mrs. Leishman's, Chase, Enfield. Why not come down
by the Green Lanes on Sunday? Picquet all day. Pass the Church, pass the
"Rising Sun," turn sharp round the corner, and we are the 6th or 7th

<p>[Mrs. Leishman's house, or its successor, is the seventh from the Rising
Sun. It is now on Gentleman's Row, not on Chase Side proper. The house
next it—still, as in Lamb's day, a girl's school—is called Elm House,
but most of the elms which darkened both doors have vanished. It has
been surmised that when later in the year Lamb took an Enfield house in
his own name, he took Mrs. Leishman's; but, as we shall see, his own
house was some little distance from hers.]</p>

<p>LETTER 419</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO P.G. PATMORE</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: July 19, 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear P.—I am so poorly! I have been to a funeral, where I made a pun,
to the consternation of the rest of the mourners. And we had wine. I
can't describe to you the howl which the widow set up at proper
intervals. Dash could, for it was not unlike what he makes.</p>
<p>The letter I sent you was one directed to the care of E. White, India
House, for Mrs. Hazlitt. <emphasis>Which</emphasis> Mrs. Hazlitt I don't yet know, but A.
has taken it to France on speculation. Really it is embarrassing. There
is Mrs. present H., Mrs. late H., and Mrs. John H., and to which of the
three Mrs. Wiggins's it appertains, I don't know. I wanted to open it,
but it's transportation.</p>
<p>I am sorry you are plagued about your book. I would strongly recommend
you to take for one story Massinger's "Old Law." It is exquisite. I can
think of no other.</p>
<p>Dash is frightful this morning. He whines and stands up on his hind
legs. He misses Beckey, who is gone to town. I took him to Barnet the
other day, and he couldn't eat his victuals after it. Pray God his
intellectuals be not slipping.</p>
<p>Mary is gone out for some soles. I suppose 'tis no use to ask you to
come and partake of 'em; else there's a steam-vessel.</p>
<p>I am doing a tragi-comedy in two acts, and have got on tolerably; but it
will be refused, or worse. I never had luck with anything my name was
put to.</p>
<p>Oh, I am so poorly! I <emphasis>waked</emphasis> it at my cousin's the bookbinder's, who is
now with God; or, if he is not, it's no fault of mine.</p>
<p>We hope the Frank wines do not disagree with Mrs. Patmore. By the way, I
like her.</p>
<p>Did you ever taste frogs? Get them, if you can. They are like little</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lilliput rabbits, only a thought nicer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Christ, how sick I am!—not of the world, but of the widow's shrub.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She's sworn under £6000, but I think she perjured herself. She howls in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

E <emphasis>la</emphasis>, and I comfort her in B flat. You understand music?…</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No shrimps!" (That's in answer to Mary's question about how the soles
are to be done.)</p>
<p>I am uncertain where this <emphasis>wandering</emphasis> letter may reach you. What you
mean by Poste Restante, God knows. Do you mean I must pay the postage?
So I do to Dover.</p>
<p>We had a merry passage with the widow at the Commons. She was
howling—part howling and part giving directions to the proctor—when
crash! down went my sister through a crazy chair, and made the clerks
grin, and I grinned, and the widow tittered—<emphasis>and then I knew that she
was not inconsolable</emphasis>. Mary was more frightened than hurt.</p>
<p>She'd make a good match for anybody (by she, I mean the widow).</p>

<p><strong>SHENSTONE.</strong></p>
<p>Procter has got a wen growing out at the nape of his neck, which his
wife wants him to have cut off; but I think it rather an agreeable
excrescence—like his poetry—redundant. Hone has hanged himself for
debt. Godwin was taken up for picking pockets…. Beckey takes to bad
courses. Her father was blown up in a steam machine. The coroner found
it Insanity. I should not like him to sit on my letter.</p>
<p>Do you observe my direction? Is it Gallic?—Classical?</p>
<p>Do try and get some frogs. You must ask for "grenouilles" (green-eels).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They don't understand "frogs," though it's a common phrase with us.</p>

<p>If you go through Bulloign (Boulogne) enquire if old Godfrey is living,
and how he got home from the Crusades. He must be a very old man now.</p>
<p>If there is anything new in politics or literature in France, keep it
till I see you again, for I'm in no hurry. Chatty-Briant is well I hope.</p>
<p>I think I have no more news; only give both our loves ("all three," says
Dash) to Mrs. Patmore, and bid her get quite well, as I am at present,
bating qualms, and the grief incident to losing a valuable relation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C.L.</strong></p>
<p>Londres, July 19, 1827.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[This is from Patmore's <emphasis>My Friends and Acquaintances</emphasis>, 1854; but I have
no confidence in Patmore's transcription. After "picking pockets" should
come, for example, according to other editors, the sentence, "Moxon has
fallen in love with Emma, our nut-brown maid." This is the first we hear
of the circumstance and quite probably Lamb was then exaggerating. As it
happened, however, Moxon and Miss Isola, as we shall see, were married
in 1833.</p>
<p>We do not know the name of the widow; but her husband was Lamb's cousin,
the bookbinder.</p>
<p>The doubt about the Hazlitts refers chiefly to William Hazlitt's divorce
from his first wife in 1822, and his remarriage in 1824 with a Mrs.
Bridgewater.</p>
<p>"Your book." Patmore, in <emphasis>My Friends and Acquaintances</emphasis>, writes:—</p>
<p>This refers to a series of tales that I was writing, (since published
under the title of <emphasis>Chatsworth, or the Romance of a Week</emphasis>.) for the
subject of one of which he had recommended me to take "The Old Law." As
Lamb's critical faculties (as displayed in the celebrated "specimens"
which created an era in the dramatic taste of England) were not
surpassed by those of any writer of his day, the reader may like to see
a few "specimens" of some notes which Lamb took the pains to make on two
of the tales that were shown to him. I give these the rather that there
is occasionally blended with their critical nicety of tact, a drollery
that is very characteristic of the writer. I shall leave these notes and
verbal criticisms to speak for themselves, after merely explaining that
they are written on separate bits of paper, each note having a numerical
reference to that page of the MS. in which occurs the passage commented
on.</p>
<p>"Besides the words 'riant' and 'Euphrosyne,' the sentence is senseless.
'A sweet sadness' capable of inspiring 'a more <emphasis>grave joy</emphasis>'—than
what?—than demonstrations of <emphasis>mirth</emphasis>? Odd if it had not been. I had
once a <emphasis>wry aunt</emphasis>, which may make me dislike the phrase.</p>
<p>"'Pleasurable:'—no word is good that is awkward to spell. (Query.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Welcome or Joyous.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'<emphasis>Steady self-possession</emphasis> rather than <emphasis>undaunted courage</emphasis>,' etc. The
two things are not opposed enough. You mean, rather than rash fire of
valour in action.</p>
<p>"'Looking like a heifer,' I fear wont do in prose. (Qy.) 'Like to some
spotless heifer,'—or,'that you might have compared her to some spotless
heifer,' etc.—or 'Like to some sacrificial heifer of old.' I should
prefer, 'garlanded with flowers as for a sacrifice '—and cut the cow
altogether.</p>
<p>"(Say) 'Like the muttering of some strange spell,'—omitting the
demon,—they are <emphasis>subject</emphasis> to spells, they don't use them.</p>
<p>"'Feud' here (and before and after) is wrong. (Say) old malice, or,
difference. <emphasis>Feud</emphasis> is of clans. It might be applied to family quarrels,
but is quite improper to individuals falling out.</p>
<p>"'Apathetic.' Vile word.</p>
<p>"'Mechanically,' faugh!—insensibly—involuntarily—in-any-thing-ly but
mechanically.</p>
<p>"Calianax's character should be somewhere briefly <emphasis>drawn</emphasis>, not left to
be dramatically inferred.</p>
<p>"'Surprised and almost vexed while it troubled her.' (Awkward.) Better,
'in a way that while it deeply troubled her, could not but surprise and
vex her to think it should be a source of trouble at all.'</p>
<p>"'Reaction' is vile slang. 'Physical'—vile word.</p>
<p>"Decidedly, Dorigen should simply propose to him to remove the rocks as
<emphasis>ugly</emphasis> or <emphasis>dangerous</emphasis>, not as affecting her with fears for her husband.
The idea of her husband should be excluded from a promise which is meant
to be <emphasis>frank</emphasis> upon impossible conditions. She cannot promise in one
breath infidelity to him, and make the conditions a good to him. Her
reason for hating the rocks is good, but not to be expressed here.</p>
<p>"Insert after 'to whatever consequences it might lead,'—'Neither had
Arviragus been disposed to interpose a husband's authority to prevent
the execution of this rash vow, was he unmindful of that older and more
solemn vow which, in the days of their marriage, he had imposed upon
himself, in no instance to control the settled purpose or determination
of his wedded wife;—so that by the chains of a double contract he
seemed bound to abide by her decision in this instance, whatever it
might be.'"</p>
<p>"A tragi-comedy"—Lamb's dramatic version of Crabbe's "Confidante,"
which he called "The Wife's Trial" (see Vol. IV. of this edition).</p>
<p>"Procter has got a wen." This paragraph must be taken with salt. Poor
Hone, however, had the rules of the King's Bench at the time. Beckey was
the Lambs' servant and tyrant; she had been Hazlitt's. Patmore described
her at some length in his reminiscences of Lamb.</p>

<p>LETTER 420</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. PERCY BYSSHE SHELLEY</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, July 26th, 1827.</p>
<p>Dear Mrs. Shelley,—At the risk of throwing away some fine thoughts, I
must write to say how pleased we were with your very kind remembering of
us (who have unkindly run away from all our friends) before you go.
Perhaps you are gone, and then my tropes are wasted. If any piece of
better fortune has lighted upon you than you expected, but less than we
wish you, we are rejoiced. We are here trying to like solitude, but have
scarce enough to justify the experiment. We get some, however. The six
days are our Sabbath; the seventh—why, Cockneys will come for a little
fresh air, and so—</p>
<p>But by <emphasis>your month</emphasis>, or October at furthest, we hope to see Islington: I
like a giant refreshed with the leaving off of wine, and Mary, pining
for Mr. Moxon's books and Mr. Moxon's society. Then we shall meet.</p>
<p>I am busy with a farce in two acts, the incidents tragi-comic. I can do
the dialogue <emphasis>commey fo</emphasis>: but the damned plot—I believe I must omit it
altogether. The scenes come after one another like geese, not
marshalling like cranes or a Hyde Park review. The story is as simple as
G[eorge] D[yer], and the language plain as his spouse. The characters
are three women to one man; which is one more than laid hold on him in
the "Evangely." I think that prophecy squinted towards my drama.</p>
<p>I want some Howard Paine to sketch a skeleton of artfully succeeding
scenes through a whole play, as the courses are arranged in a cookery
book: I to find wit, passion, sentiment, character, and the like
trifles: to lay in the dead colours,—I'd Titianesque 'em up: to mark
the channel in a cheek (smooth or furrowed, yours or mine), and where
tears should course I'd draw the waters down: to say where a joke should
come in or a pun be left out: to bring my <emphasis>personae</emphasis> on and off like a
Beau Nash; and I'd Frankenstein them there: to bring three together on
the stage at once; they are so shy with me, that I can get no more than
two; and there they stand till it is the time, without being the season,
to withdraw them.</p>
<p>I am teaching Emma Latin to qualify her for a superior governess-ship;
which we see no prospect of her getting. 'Tis like feeding a child with
chopped hay from a spoon. Sisyphus—his labours were as nothing to it.</p>
<p>Actives and passives jostle in her nonsense, till a deponent enters,
like Chaos, more to embroil the fray. Her prepositions are suppositions;
her conjunctions copulative have no connection in them; her concords
disagree; her interjections are purely English "Ah!" and "Oh!" with a
yawn and a gape in the same tongue; and she herself is a lazy,
block-headly supine. As I say to her, ass <emphasis>in praesenti</emphasis> rarely makes a
wise man <emphasis>in futuro</emphasis>.</p>
<p>But I daresay it was so with you when you began Latin, and a good while
after.</p>
<p>Good-by! Mary's love.</p>
<p>Yours truly,                                               C. LAMB.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[This is the second letter to Mrs. Shelley, <emphasis>née</emphasis> Mary Wollstonecraft
Godwin, the widow of the poet and the author of <emphasis>Frankenstein</emphasis>. She had
been living in England since 1823; and in 1826 had issued anonymously
<emphasis>The Last Man</emphasis>. That she kept much in touch with the Lambs' affairs we
know by her letters to Leigh Hunt.</p>
<p>Major Butterworth has kindly supplied me with a copy of her letter to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mary Lamb which called forth Lamb's reply. It runs thus:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Kentish Town, 22 July, 1827.</p>
<p>My dear Miss Lamb,</p>
<p>You have been long at Enfield—I hardly know yet whether you are
returned—and I quit town so very soon that I have not time to—as I
exceedingly wish—call on you before I go. Nevertheless believe (if such
familiar expression be not unmeet from me) that I love you with all my
heart—gratefully and sincerely—and that when I return I shall seek you
with, I hope, not too much zeal—but it will be with great eagerness.</p>
<p>You will be glad to hear that I have every reason to believe that the
worst of my pecuniary troubles are over—as I am promised a regular tho'
small income from my father-in-law. I mean to be very industrious <emphasis>on
other accounts</emphasis> this summer, so I hope nothing will go very ill with me
or mine.</p>
<p>I am afraid Miss Kelly will think me dreadfully rude for not having
availed myself of her kind invitation. Will you present my compliments
to her, and say that my embarassments, harassings and distance from town
are the guilty causes of my omission—for which with her leave I will
apologize in person on my return to London.</p>
<p>All kind and grateful remembrances to Mr. Lamb, he must not forget me
nor like me one atom less than I delight to flatter myself he does now,
when again I come to seize a dinner perforce at your cottage. Percy is
quite well—and is reading with great extacy (<emphasis>sic</emphasis>) the Arabian Nights.
I shall return I suppose some one day in September. God bless you.</p>
<p>Yours affectionately,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MARY W. SHELLEY.</strong></p>
<p><emphasis>Commey fo</emphasis> is Lamb's <emphasis>comme il faut</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"In the 'Evangely.'" If by Evangely he meant Gospel, Lamb was a little
confused here, I think. Probably Isaiah iv. I was in his mind: "and in
that day seven women shall take hold of one man." But he may also have
half remembered Luke xvii. 35.</p>

amusing passage concerning Emma Isola's Latin. Lamb says that they made
Cary laugh by translating "Blast you" into such elegant verbiage as
"Deus afflet tibi." He adds, "How some parsons would have goggled and
what would Hannah More say? I don't like clergymen, but here and there
one. Cary, the Dante Cary, is a model quite as plain as Parson Primrose,
without a shade of silliness."</p>
<p>On July 21, 1827, is a letter to Mr. Dillon, whom I do not identify,
saying that Lamb has been teaching Emma Isola Latin for the past seven
weeks.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. BASIL MONTAGU</strong></p>
<p>[Summer, 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear Madam,—I return your List with my name. I should be sorry that any
respect should be going on towards [Clarkson,] and I be left out of the
conspiracy. Otherwise I frankly own that to pillarize a man's good
feelings in his lifetime is not to my taste. Monuments to goodness, even
after death, are equivocal. I turn away from Howard's, I scarce know
why. Goodness blows no trumpet, nor desires to have it blown. We should
be modest for a modest man—as he is for himself. The vanities of
Life—Art, Poetry, Skill military, are subjects for trophies; not the
silent thoughts arising in a good man's mind in lonely places. Was I
C[larkson,] I should never be able to walk or ride near ——— again.
Instead of bread, we are giving him a stone. Instead of the locality
recalling the noblest moment of his existence, it is a place at which
his friends (that is, himself) blow to the world, "What a good man is
he!" I sat down upon a hillock at Forty Hill yesternight—a fine
contemplative evening,—with a thousand good speculations about mankind.
How I yearned with cheap benevolence! I shall go and inquire of the
stone-cutter, that cuts the tombstones here, what a stone with a short
inscription will cost; just to say—"Here C. Lamb loved his brethren of
mankind." Everybody will come there to love. As I can't well put my own
name, I shall put about a subscription:</p>

said had just arrived to him from his beloved brother lately dead in

had disgusted Carlyle.</p>

<p>LETTER 422</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MARY LAMB TO LADY STODDART</strong></p>
<p>[August 9, 1827.]</p>
<p>My dear Lady-Friend,—My brother called at our empty cottage yesterday,
and found the cards of your son and his friend, Mr. Hine, under the
door; which has brought to my mind that I am in danger of losing this
post, as I did the last, being at that time in a confused state of
mind—for at that time we were talking of leaving, and persuading
ourselves that we were intending to leave town and all our friends, and
sit down for ever, solitary and forgotten, here. Here we are; and we
have locked up our house, and left it to take care of itself; but at
present we do not design to extend our rural life beyond Michaelmas.
Your kind letter was most welcome to me, though the good news contained
in it was already known to me. Accept my warmest congratulations, though
they come a little of the latest. In my next I may probably have to hail
you Grandmama; or to felicitate you on the nuptials of pretty Mary, who,
whatever the beaux of Malta may think of her, I can only remember her
round shining face, and her "O William!"—"dear William!" when we
visited her the other day at school. Present my love and best wishes—a
long and happy married life to dear Isabella—I love to call her
Isabella; but in truth, having left your other letter in town, I
recollect no other name she has.</p>
<p>The same love and the same wishes—in futuro—to my friend Mary. Tell
her that her "dear William" grows taller, and improves in manly looks
and manlike behaviour every time I see him. What is Henry about? and
what should one wish for him? If he be in search of a wife, I will send
him out Emma Isola.</p>
<p>You remember Emma, that you were so kind as to invite to your ball? She
is now with us; and I am moving heaven and earth, that is to say, I am
pressing the matter upon all the very few friends I have that are likely
to assist me in such a case, to get her into a family as a governess;
and Charles and I do little else here than teach her something or other
all day long.</p>
<p>We are striving to put enough Latin into her to enable her to begin to
teach it to young learners. So much for Emma —for you are so fearfully
far away, that I fear it is useless to implore your patronage for her.</p>
<p>I have not heard from Mrs. Hazlitt a long time. I believe she is still
with Hazlitt's mother in Devonshire.</p>
<p>I expect a pacquet of manuscript from you: you promised me the office of
negotiating with booksellers, and so forth, for your next work. Is it in
good forwardness? or do you grow rich and indolent now? It is not
surprising that your Maltese story should find its way into Malta; but I
was highly pleased with the idea of your pleasant surprise at the sight
of it. I took a large sheet of paper, in order to leave Charles room to
add something more worth reading than my poor mite.</p>
<p>May we all meet again once more!</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SIR JOHN STODDART</strong></p>
<p>(<emphasis>Same letter: Lamb's share</emphasis>)</p>
<p>Dear Knight—Old Acquaintance—'Tis with a violence to the <emphasis>pure
imagination</emphasis> (<emphasis>vide</emphasis> the "Excursion" <emphasis>passim</emphasis>) that I can bring myself
to believe I am writing to Dr. Stoddart once again, at Malta. But the
deductions of severe reason warrant the proceeding. I write from
Enfield, where we are seriously weighing the advantages of dulness over
the over-excitement of too much company, but have not yet come to a
conclusion. What is the news? for we see no paper here; perhaps you can
send us an old one from Malta. Only, I heard a butcher in the
market-place whisper something about a change of ministry. I don't know
who's in or out, or care, only as it might affect <emphasis>you</emphasis>. For domestic
doings, I have only to tell, with extreme regret, that poor Elisa
Fenwick (that was)—Mrs. Rutherford—is dead; and that we have received
a most heart-broken letter from her mother—left with four
grandchildren, orphans of a living scoundrel lurking about the pothouses
of Little Russell Street, London: they and she—God help 'em!—at New
York. I have just received Godwin's third volume of the <emphasis>Republic</emphasis>,
which only reaches to the commencement of the Protectorate. I think he
means to spin it out to his life's thread. Have you seen Fearn's
<emphasis>Anti-Tooke</emphasis>? I am no judge of such things—you are; but I think it very
clever indeed. If I knew your bookseller, I'd order it for you at a
venture: 'tis two octavos, Longman and Co. Or do you read now? Tell it
not in the Admiralty Court, but my head aches <emphasis>hesterno vino</emphasis>. I can
scarce pump up words, much less ideas, congruous to be sent so far. But
your son must have this by to-night's post.[<emphasis>Here came a passage
relating to an escapade of young Stoddart, then at the Charterhouse,
which, probably through Lamb's intervention, was treated leniently. Lamb
helped him—with his imposition— Gray's "Elegy" into Greek elegiacs</emphasis>.]
Manning is gone to Rome, Naples, etc., probably to touch at Sicily,
Malta, Guernsey, etc.; but I don't know the map. Hazlitt is resident at
Paris, whence he pours his lampoons in safety at his friends in England.
He has his boy with him. I am teaching Emma Latin. By the time you can
answer this, she will be qualified to instruct young ladies: she is a
capital English reader: and S.T.C. acknowledges that a part of a passage
in Milton she read better than he, and part he read best, her part being
the shorter. But, seriously, if Lady St——— (oblivious pen, that was
about to write <emphasis>Mrs.</emphasis>!) could hear of such a young person wanted (she
smatters of French, some Italian, music of course), we'd send our loves
by her. My congratulations and assurances of old esteem.             C.L.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. 10 August, 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I have not been able to: answer you, for we have had, and
are having (I just snatch a moment), our poor quiet retreat, to which we
fled from society, full of company, some staying with us, and this
moment as I write almost a heavy importation of two old Ladies has come
in. Whither can I take wing from the oppression of human faces? Would I
were in a wilderness of Apes, tossing cocoa nuts about, grinning and
grinned at!</p>
<p>Mitford was hoaxing you surely about my Engraving, 'tis a little
sixpenny thing, too like by half, in which the draughtsman has done his
best to avoid flattery. There have been 2 editions of it, which I think
are all gone, as they have vanish'd from the window where they hung, a
print shop, corner of Great and Little Queen Streets, Lincolns Inn
fields, where any London friend of yours may inquire for it; for I am
(tho' you <emphasis>won't understand</emphasis> it) at Enfield (Mrs. Leishman's, Chase). We
have been here near 3 months, and shall stay 2 or more, if people will
let us alone, but they persecute us from village to village. So don't
direct to <emphasis>Islington</emphasis> again, till further notice.</p>
<p>I am trying my hand at a Drama, in 2 acts, founded on Crabbe's</p>

<p>You like the Odyssey. Did you ever read my "Adventures of Ulysses,"
founded on Chapman's old translation of it? for children or <emphasis>men</emphasis>. Ch.
is divine, and my abridgment has not quite emptied him of his divinity.
When you come to town I'll show it you.</p>
<p>You have well described your old fashioned Grand-paternall Hall. Is it
not odd that every one's earliest recollections are of some such place.
I had my Blakesware (Blakesmoor in the "London"). Nothing fills a childs
mind like a large old Mansion [<emphasis>one or two words wafered over</emphasis>]; better
if un-or-partially-occupied; peopled with the spirits of deceased
members of [for] the County and Justices of the Quorum. Would I were
buried in the peopled solitude of one, with my feelings at 7 years old.</p>
<p>Those marble busts of the Emperors, they seem'd as if they were to stand
for ever, as they had stood from the living days of Rome, in that old
Marble Hall, and I to partake of their permanency; Eternity was, while I
thought not of Time. But he thought of me, and they are toppled down,
and corn covers the spot of the noble old Dwelling and its princely
gardens. I feel like a grasshopper that chirping about the grounds
escaped his scythe only by my littleness. Ev'n now he is whetting one of
his smallest razors to clean wipe me out, perhaps. Well!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>["My Engraving"—Brook Pulham's caricature.</p>
<p>"You have well described your … Grand-paternall Hall." Barton wrote
the following account of this house, the home of his step-grandfather at
Tottenham; but I do not know whether it is the same that Lamb saw:—</p>
<p>    My most delightful recollections of boyhood are connected with the
    fine old country-house in a green lane diverging from the high road
    which runs through Tottenham. I would give seven years of life as it
    now is, for a week of that which I then led. It was a large old
    house, with an iron palisade and a pair of iron gates in front, and
    a huge stone eagle on each pier. Leading up to the steps by which
    you went up to the hall door, was a wide gravel walk, bordered in
    summer time by huge tubs, in which were orange and lemon trees, and
    in the centre of the grass-plot stood a tub yet huger, holding an
    enormous aloe, The hall itself, to my fancy then lofty and wide as a
    cathedral would seem now, was a famous place for battledore and
    shuttlecock; and behind was a garden, equal to that of old Alcinous
    himself. My favourite walk was one of turf by a long straight pond,
    bordered with lime-trees. But the whole demesne was the fairy ground
    of my childhood; and its presiding genius was grandpapa. He must
    have been a very handsome man in his youth, for I remember him at
    nearly eighty, a very fine-looking one, even in the decay of mind
    and body. In the morning a velvet cap; by dinner, a flaxen wig; his
    features always expressive of benignity and placid cheerfulness.
    When he walked out into the garden, his cocked hat and amber-headed
    cane completed his costume. To the recollection of this delightful
    personage, I am, I think, indebted for many soothing and pleasing
    associations, with old age.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>28th of Aug., 1827.</p>
<p>I have left a place for a wafer, but can't find it again.</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I am thankful to you for your ready compliance with my
wishes. Emma is delighted with your verses, to which I have appended
this notice "The 6th line refers to the child of a dear friend of the
author's, named Emma," without which it must be obscure; and have sent
it with four Album poems of my own (your daughter's with <emphasis>your</emphasis> heading,
requesting it a place next mine) to a Mr. Fraser, who is to be editor of
a more superb Pocket book than has yet appeared by far! the property of
some wealthy booksellers, but whom, or what its name, I forgot to ask.
It is actually to have in it schoolboy exercises by his present Majesty
and the late Duke of York, so Lucy will come to Court; how she will be
stared at! Wordsworth is named as a Contributor. Frazer, whom I have
slightly seen, is Editor of a forth-come or coming Review of foreign
books, and is intimately connected with Lockhart, &amp;c. so I take it that
this is a concern of Murray's. Walter Scott also contributes mainly. I
have stood off a long time from these Annuals, which are ostentatious
trumpery, but could not withstand the request of Jameson, a particular
friend of mine and Coleridge.</p>
<p>I shall hate myself in frippery, strutting along, and vying finery with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beaux and Belles</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        with "Future Lord Byrons and sweet L.E.L.'s."—</p>
<p>Your taste I see is less simple than mine, which the difference of our
persuasions has doubtless effected. In fact, of late you have so
frenchify'd your style, larding it with hors de combats, and au
desopoirs, that o' my conscience the Foxian blood is quite dried out of
you, and the skipping Monsieur spirit has been infused. Doth Lucy go to
Balls? I must remodel my lines, which I write for her. I hope A.K. keeps
to her Primitives. If you have any thing you'd like to send further, I
don't know Frazer's address, but I sent mine thro' Mr. Jameson, 19 or 90
Cheyne Street, Totnam Court road. I dare say an honourable place wou'd
be given to them; but I have not heard from Frazer since I sent mine,
nor shall probably again, and therefore I do not solicit it as from him.</p>
<p>Yesterday I sent off my tragi comedy to Mr. Kemble. Wish it luck. I made
it all ('tis blank verse, and I think, of the true old dramatic cut) or
most of it, in the green lanes about Enfield, where I am and mean to
remain, in spite of your peremptory doubts on that head.</p>
<p>Your refusal to lend your poetical sanction to my Icon, and your reasons
to Evans, are most sensible. May be I may hit on a line or two of my own
jocular. May be not.</p>
<p>Do you never Londonize again? I should like to talk over old poetry with
you, of which I have much, and you I think little. Do your Drummonds
allow no holydays? I would willingly come and w[ork] for you a three
weeks or so, to let you loose. Would I could sell or give you some of my
Leisure! Positively, the best thing a man can have to do is nothing, and
next to that perhaps—good works.</p>
<p>I am but poorlyish, and feel myself writing a dull letter; poorlyish
from Company, not generally, for I never was better, nor took more
walks, 14 miles a day on an average, with a sporting dog—Dash—you
would not know the plain Poet, any more than he doth recognize James
Naylor trick'd out au deserpoy (how do you spell it.) En Passant, J'aime

<p>[The verses with which Emma was delighted were probably written for her
album. I have not seen them. That album was cut up for the value of its
autographs and exists now only in a mutilated state: where, I cannot
discover. The pocket-book was <emphasis>The Bijou</emphasis>, 1828, edited by William
Fraser for Pickering. Only one of Lamb's contributions was included: his
verses for his own album (see Vol. IV. of this edition).</p>
<p>Jameson was Robert Jameson, to whom Hartley Coleridge addressed the
sonnets in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> to which Lamb alludes in a previous
letter. He was the husband of Mrs. Jameson, author of <emphasis>Sacred and
Legendary Art</emphasis>, but the marriage was not happy. He lived in Chenies

Album?"—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        'Tis a Book kept by modern Young Ladies for show,</p>

<p>L.E.L. was, of course, the unhappy Letitia Landon, a famous contributor
to the published albums.</p>
<p>"My tragi comedy." Still "The Wife's Trial." Kemble was Charles Kemble,
manager of Covent Garden Theatre. The play was never acted.</p>
<p>"Your refusal to lend your poetical sanction." This is not clear, but I
think the meaning to be deducible. The Icon was Pulham's etching of
Lamb. Evans was William Evans, who had grangerised Byron's <emphasis>English
Bards and Scotch Reviewers</emphasis>. I take it that he was now making another
collection of portraits of poets and was asking other poets, their
friends, to write verses upon them. In this way he had applied through
Lamb to Barton for verses on Pulham's Elia, and had been refused. This
is, of course, only conjecture.</p>
<p>"Your Drummonds"—your bankers. Barton's bankers were the Alexanders, a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Quaker firm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"James Naylor." Barton had paraphrased Nayler's "Testimony."</p>
<p>Following this letter, under the date August 29, 1827, should come a
letter from Lamb to Robert Jameson (husband of Mrs. Jameson) asking him
to interest himself in Miss Isola's career. "Our friend Coleridge will
bear witness to the very excellent manner in which she read to him some
of the most difficult passages in the Paradise Lost."]</p>

<p>LETTER 426</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO P.G. PATMORE</strong></p>
<p>Mrs. Leishman's, Chace, Enfield,</p>
<p>September, 1827.</p>
<p>Dear Patmore—Excuse my anxiety—but how is Dash? (I should have asked
if Mrs. Patmore kept her rules, and was improving—but Dash came
uppermost. The order of our thoughts should be the order of our
writing.) Goes he muzzled, or <emphasis>aperto ore</emphasis>? Are his intellects sound, or
does he wander a little in <emphasis>his</emphasis> conversation? You cannot be too careful
to watch the first symptoms of incoherence. The first illogical snarl he
makes, to St. Luke's with him! All the dogs here are going mad, if you
believe the overseers; but I protest they seem to me very rational and
collected. But nothing is so deceitful as mad people to those who are
not used to them. Try him with hot water. If he won't lick it up, it is
a sign he does not like it. Does his tail wag horizontally or
perpendicularly? That has decided the fate of many dogs in Enfield. Is
his general deportment cheerful? I mean when he is pleased—for
otherwise there is no judging. You can't be too careful. Has he bit any
of the children yet? If he has, have them shot, and keep <emphasis>him</emphasis> for
curiosity, to see if it was the hydrophobia. They say all our army in
India had it at one time—but that was in <emphasis>Hyder</emphasis>-Ally's time. Do you
get paunch for him? Take care the sheep was sane. You might pull out his
teeth (if he would let you), and then you need not mind if he were as
mad as a Bedlamite. It would be rather fun to see his odd ways. It might
amuse Mrs. Patmore and the children. They'd have more sense than he!
He'd be like a Fool kept in the family, to keep the household in good
humour with their own understanding. You might teach him the mad dance
set to the mad howl. <emphasis>Madge Owl-et</emphasis> would be nothing to him. "My, how he
capers!" [<emphasis>In the margin is written</emphasis>:] One of the children speaks this.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Three lines here are erased</emphasis>.] What I scratch out is a German
quotation from Lessing on the bite of rabid animals; but, I remember,
you don't read German. But Mrs. Patmore may, so I wish I had let it
stand. The meaning in English is—"Avoid to approach an animal suspected
of madness, as you would avoid fire or a precipice:—" which I think is
a sensible observation. The Germans are certainly profounder than we.</p>
<p>If the slightest suspicion arises in your breast, that all is not right
with him (Dash), muzzle him, and lead him in a string (common
pack-thread will do; he don't care for twist) to Hood's, his quondam
master, and he'll take him in at any time. You may mention your
suspicion or not, as you like, or as you think it may wound or not Mr.
H.'s feelings. Hood, I know, will wink at a few follies in Dash, in
consideration of his former sense. Besides, Hood is deaf, and if you
hinted anything, ten to one he would not hear you. Besides, you will
have discharged your conscience, and laid the child at the right door,
as they say.</p>
<p>We are dawdling our time away very idly and pleasantly, at a Mrs.
Leishman's, Chace, Enfield, where, if you come a-hunting, we can give
you cold meat and a tankard. Her husband is a tailor; but that, you
know, does not make her one. I knew a jailor (which rhymes), but his
wife was a fine lady.</p>
<p>Let us hear from you respecting Mrs. Patmore's regimen. I send my love
in a ——— to Dash.                                  C. LAMB.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>On the outside of the letter was written</emphasis>:—]</p>
<p>Seriously, I wish you would call upon Hood when you are that way. He's a
capital fellow. I sent him a couple of poems —one ordered by his wife,
and written to order; and 'tis a week since, and I've not heard from
him. I fear something is the matter.</p>

<p>Dash had been Hood's dog, and afterwards was Lamb's; while at one time
Moxon seems to have had the care of it. Patmore possibly was taking Dash
while the Lambs were at Mrs. Leishman's. One of the children who might
be amused by the dog's mad ways was Coventry Patmore, afterwards the
poet, then nearly four years old.]</p>

<p>Dear Dib,—Emma Isola, who is with us, has opened an ALBUM: bring some
verses with you for it on Sat'y evening. Any <emphasis>fun</emphasis> will do. I am
teaching her Latin; you may make something of that. Don't be modest. For
in it you shall appear, if I rummage out some of your old pleasant
letters for rhymes. But an original is better.</p>

<p>Dear <emphasis>John</emphasis>—Your verses are very pleasant, and have been adopted into
the splendid Emmatic constellation, where they are not of the least
magnitude. She is delighted with their merit and readiness. They are
just the thing. The 14th line is found. We advertised it. Hell is
cooling for want of company. We shall make it up along with our kitchen
fire to roast you into our new House, where I hope you will find us in a
few Sundays. We have actually taken it, and a compact thing it will be.</p>
<p>Kemble does not return till the month's end. My heart sometimes is good,
sometimes bad, about it, as the day turns out wet or walky.</p>
<p>Emma has just died, choak'd with a Gerund in dum. On opening her we
found a Participle in rus in the pericordium. The king never dies, which
may be the reason that it always REIGNS here.</p>

which I had obscured your merits!</p>
<p>What I think of the paternal verses, you shall read within,
which I assure you is not pen praise but heart praise.</p>
<p>It is the gem of the Dibdin Muses.</p>
<p>I have got all my books into my new house, and their
readers in a fortnight will follow, to whose joint converse nobody
shall be more welcome than you, and <emphasis>any of yours</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The house is perfection to our use and comfort.</p>
<p>Milton is come. I wish Wordsworth were here to meet him.
The next importation is of pots and saucepans, window curtains,

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS HOOD</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday [September 18, 1827],</p>
<p>Dear Hood,</p>
<p>If I have any thing in my head, I will send it to Mr.
Watts. Strictly speaking he should have had my Album
verses, but a very intimate friend importund me for the trifles,
and I believe I forgot Mr. Watts, or lost sight at the time of his
similar Souvenir. Jamieson conveyed the farce from me to
Mrs. C. Kemble, <emphasis>he</emphasis> will not be in town before the 27th. Give
our kind loves to all at Highgate, and tell them that we have
finally torn ourselves out right away from Colebrooke, where I
had no health, and are about to domiciliate for good at Enfield,
where I have experienced <emphasis>good</emphasis>.</p>
<p>            Lord what good hours do we keep!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            How quietly we sleep!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>See the rest in the Complete Angler. We have got our books into our new
house. I am a drayhorse if I was not asham'd of the indigested dirty
lumber, as I toppled 'em out of the cart, and blest Becky that came with
'em for her having an unstuffd brain with such rubbish. We shall get in
by Michael's mass. Twas with some pain we were evuls'd from Colebrook.
You may find some of our flesh sticking to the door posts. To change
habitations is to die to them, and in my time I have died seven deaths.
But I don't know whether every such change does not bring with it a
rejuvenescence. Tis an enterprise, and shoves back the sense of death's
approximating, which tho' not terrible to me, is at all times
particularly distasteful. My house-deaths have generally been
periodical, recurring after seven years, but this last is premature by
half that time. Cut off in the flower of Colebrook. The Middletonian
stream and all its echoes mourn. Even minnows dwindle. A parvis fiunt
MINIMI. I fear to invite Mrs. Hood to our new mansion, lest she envy it,
&amp; rote [? rout] us. But when we are fairly in, I hope she will come &amp;
try it. I heard she &amp; you were made uncomfortable by some unworthy to be
cared for attacks, and have tried to set up a feeble counteraction thro'
the Table Book of last Saturday. Has it not reach'd you, that you are
silent about it? Our new domicile is no manor house, but new, &amp;
externally not inviting, but furnish'd within with every convenience.
Capital new locks to every door, capital grates in every room, with
nothing to pay for incoming &amp; the rent £10 less than the Islington one.
It was built a few years since at £1100 expence, they tell me, &amp; I
perfectly believe it. And I get it for £35 exclusive of moderate taxes.
We think ourselves most lucky. It is not our intention to abandon Regent
Street, &amp; West End perambulations (monastic &amp; terrible thought!), but
occasionally to breathe the FRESHER AIR of the metropolis. We shall put
up a bedroom or two (all we want) for occasional ex-rustication, where
we shall visit, not be visited. Plays too we'll see,—perhaps our own.
Urban! Sylvani, &amp; Sylvan Urbanuses in turns. Courtiers for a spurt, then
philosophers. Old homely tell-truths and learn-truths in the virtuous
shades of Enfield, Liars again and mocking gibers in the coffee houses &amp;
resorts of London. What can a mortal desire more for his bi-parted
nature?</p>
<p>O the curds &amp; cream you shall eat with us here!</p>
<p>O the turtle soup and lobster sallads we shall devour with you there!</p>
<p>O the old books we shall peruse here!</p>
<p>O the new nonsense we shall trifle over there!</p>
<p>O Sir T. Browne!—here.</p>
<p>O Mr. Hood &amp; Mr. Jerdan there,</p>
<p>thine,</p>
<p>C (urbanus) L (sylvanus) (ELIA ambo)—</p>
<p>Inclos'd are verses which Emma sat down to write, her first, on the eve
after your departure. Of course they are only for Mrs. H.'s perusal.
They will shew at least, that one of our party is not willing to cut old
friends. What to call 'em I don't know. Blank verse they are not,
because of the rhymes—Rhimes they are not, because of the blank verse.
Heroics they are not, because they are lyric, lyric they are not,
because of the Heroic measure. They must be call'd EMMAICS.———</p>

<p>Dear Sir—I beg leave in the warmest manner to recommend to your notice
Mr. Moxon, the Bearer of this, if by any chance yourself should want a
steady hand in your business, or know of any Publisher that may want
such a one. He is at present in the house of Messrs. Longman and Co.,
where he has been established for more than six years, and has the
conduct of one of the four departments of the Country line. A difference
respecting Salary, which he expected to be a little raised on his last
promotion, makes him wish to try to better himself. I believe him to be
a young man of the highest integrity, and a thorough man of business;
and should not have taken the liberty of recommending him, if I had not
thought him capable of being highly useful.</p>

the pleasure of seeing you for some time. We are in our house, but Mary
has been seized with one of her periodical disorders—a temporary
derangement—which commonly lasts for two months. You shall have the

<p>LETTER 435</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BARRON FIELD</strong></p>
<p>Oct. 4th, 1827.</p>
<p>I am not in humour to return a fit reply to your pleasant letter. We are
fairly housed at Enfield, and an angel shall not persuade me to wicked
London again. We have now six sabbath days in a week for—<emphasis>none</emphasis>! The
change has worked on my sister's mind, to make her ill; and I must wait
a tedious time before we can hope to enjoy this place in unison. Enjoy
it, when she recovers, I know we shall. I see no shadow, but in her
illness, for repenting the step! For Mathews —I know my own utter
unfitness for such a task. I am no hand at describing costumes, a great
requisite in an account of mannered pictures. I have not the slightest
acquaintance with pictorial language even. An imitator of me, or rather
pretender to be <emphasis>me</emphasis>, in his Rejected Articles, has made me minutely
describe the dresses of the poissardes at Calais!—I could as soon
resolve Euclid. I have no eye for forms and fashions. I substitute
analysis, and get rid of the phenomenon by slurring in for it its
impression. I am sure you must have observed this defect, or
peculiarity, in my writings; else the delight would be incalculable in
doing such a thing for Mathews, whom I greatly like—and Mrs. Mathews,
whom I almost greatlier like. What a feast 'twould be to be sitting at
the pictures painting 'em into words; but I could almost as soon make
words into pictures. I speak this deliberately, and not out of modesty.
I pretty well know what I can't do.</p>
<p>My sister's verses are homely, but just what they should be; I send
them, not for the poetry, but the good sense and good-will of them. I
was beginning to transcribe; but Emma is sadly jealous of its getting
into more hands, and I won't spoil it in her eyes by divulging it. Come
to Enfield, and <emphasis>read it</emphasis>. As my poor cousin, the bookbinder, now with
God, told me, most sentimentally, that having purchased a picture of
fish at a dead man's sale, his heart ached to see how the widow grieved
to part with it, being her dear husband's favourite; and he almost
apologised for his generosity by saying he could not help telling the
widow she was "welcome to come and look at it"—e.g. at <emphasis>his house</emphasis>—"as
often as she pleased." There was the germ of generosity in an uneducated
mind. He had just <emphasis>reading</emphasis> enough from the backs of books for the "<emphasis>nec
sinit esse feros</emphasis>"—had he read inside, the same impulse would have led
him to give back the two-guinea thing—with a request to see it, now and
then, at <emphasis>her</emphasis> house. We are parroted into delicacy.—Thus you have a
tale for a Sonnet.</p>
<p>Adieu! with (imagine both) our loves.                       C. LAMB.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[The suggestion had been made to Lamb, through Barron Field, that he
should write a descriptive catalogue of Charles Mathews' collection of
theatrical portraits; Lamb having already touched upon them in his "Old
Actors" articles in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> (see Vol. II. of this
edition). When they were exhibited, after Mathews' death, at the
Pantheon in Oxford Street, Lamb's remarks were appended to the catalogue
<emphasis>raisonné</emphasis>. They are now at the Garrick Club.</p>
<p>"An imitator of me." P.G. Patmore's <emphasis>Rejected Articles</emphasis>, 1826, leads off
with "An Unsentimental Journey" by Elia which is, except for a fitful
superficial imitation of some of Lamb's mannerisms, as unlike him as
could well be. The description of the butterwomen's dress, to which Lamb
refers, will illustrate the divergence between Elia and his parodist:—</p>
<p>    Her attire is fashioned as follows: and it differs from all her
    tribe only in the relative arrangement of its colours. On the body a
    crimson jacket, of a thick, solid texture, and tight to the shape;
    but without any pretence at ornament. This is met at the waist
    (which is neither long, nor short, but exactly where nature placed
    it) by a dark blue petticoat, of a still thicker texture, so that it
    hangs in large plaits where it is gathered in behind. Over this, in
    front, is tied tightly round the waist, so as to keep all trim and
    compact, a dark apron, the string of which passes over the little
    fulled skirt of the jacket behind, and makes it stick out smartly
    and tastily, while it clips the waist in. The head-gear consists of
    a sort of mob cap, nothing of which but the edge round the face can
    be seen, on account of the kerchief (of flowered cotton) which is
    passed over it, hood fashion, and half tied under the chin. This
    head-kerchief is in place of the bonnet—a thing not to be seen
    among the whole five hundred females who make up this pleasant show.
    Indeed, varying the colours of the different articles, this
    description applies to every dress of the whole assembly; except
    that in some the fineness of the day has dispensed with the
    kerchief, and left the snow-white cap exposed; and in others, the
    whole figure (except the head) is coyishly covered and concealed by
    a large hooded cloak of black cloth, daintily lined with silk, and
    confined close up to the throat by an embossed silver clasp, but
    hanging loosely down to the heels, in thick, full folds. The
    petticoat is very short; the trim ancles are cased in close-fit hose
    of dark, sober, slate colour; and the shoes, though thick and
    serviceable like all the rest of the costume, fit the foot as neatly
    as those which are not made to walk in.</p>
<p>Patmore tells us that his first meeting with the Lambs was immediately
after they had first seen his book; and they left the house intent upon
reading it.</p>
<p>"My sister's verses." I think these would probably be the lines on Emma
learning Latin which I have quoted above.</p>
<p>Here should come a very pleasant letter from Lamb to Dodwell, of the
India House, dated October 7, 1827. Lamb thanks Dodwell, to whom there
is an earlier letter extant, for a pig. He first describes his new house
at Enfield, and then breaks off about the cooking of the pig, bidding
Becky do it "nice and <emphasis>crips</emphasis>." The rest is chaff concerning the India
House and Dodwell's fellow-clerks.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM HONE</strong></p>
<p>[No date. ? Oct., 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear Hone,—having occasion to write to Clarke I put in a bit to you. I
see no Extracts in this N'o. You should have three sets in hand, one
long one in particular from Atreus and Thyestes, terribly fine. Don't
spare 'em; with fragments, divided as you please, they'll hold out to
Xmas. What I have to say is enjoined me most seriously to say to you by
Moxon. Their country customers grieve at getting the Table Book so late.
It is indispensable it should appear on Friday. Do it but <emphasis>once</emphasis>, &amp;
you'll never know the difference.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>FABLE</strong></p>
<p>A boy at my school, a cunning fox, for one penny ensured himself a hot
roll &amp; butter every morning for ever. Some favor'd ones were allowed a
roll &amp; butter to their breakfasts. He had none. But he bought one one
morning. What did he do? He did not eat it, but cutting it in two, sold
each one of the halves to a half-breakfasted Blue Boy for <emphasis>his</emphasis> whole
roll to-morrow. The next day he had a whole roll to eat, and two halves
to swap with other two boys, who had eat their cake &amp; were still not
satiated, for whole ones to-morrow. So on ad infinitum. By one morning's
abstinence he feasted seven years after.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>APPLICATION</strong></p>
<p>Bring out the next N'o. on Friday, for country correspondents' sake.
I[t] will be one piece of exertion, and you will go right ever after,
for you will have just the time you had before, to bring it out ever
after by the Friday.</p>
<p>You don't know the difference in getting a thing early. Your
correspondents are your authors. You don't know how an author frets to
know the world has got his contribution, when he finds it not on his
breakfast table.</p>
<p>ONCE in this case is EVER without a grain of trouble afterw'ds.</p>
<p>I won't like you or speak to you if you don't try it once.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[No date. Late 1827.]</p>
<p>My dear B.B.—You will understand my silence when I tell you that my
sister, on the very eve of entering into a new house we have taken at
Enfield, was surprised with an attack of one of her sad long illnesses,
which deprive me of her society, tho' not of her domestication, for
eight or nine weeks together. I see her, but it does her no good. But
for this, we have the snuggest, most comfortable house, with every thing
most compact and desirable. Colebrook is a wilderness. The Books,
prints, etc., are come here, and the New River came down with us. The
familiar Prints, the Bust, the Milton, seem scarce to have changed their
rooms. One of her last observations was "how frightfully like this room
is to our room in Islington"—our up-stairs room, she meant. How I hope
you will come some better day, and judge of it! We have tried quiet here
for four months, and I will answer for the comfort of it enduring.</p>
<p>On emptying my bookshelves I found an Ulysses, which I will send to A.K.
when I go to town, for her acceptance— unless the Book be out of print.
One likes to have one copy of every thing one does. I neglected to keep
one of "Poetry for Children," the joint production of Mary and me, and
it is not to be had for love or money. It had in the title-page "by the
author of Mrs. Lester's School." Know you any one that has it, and would
exchange it?</p>
<p>Strolling to Waltham Cross the other day, I hit off these lines. It is

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. December 4, 1827.]</p>
<p>My dear B.B.—I have scarce spirits to write, yet am harass'd with not
writing. Nine weeks are completed, and Mary does not get any better. It
is perfectly exhausting. Enfield and every thing is very gloomy. But for
long experience, I should fear her ever getting well.</p>
<p>I feel most thankful for the spinsterly attentions of your sister. Thank
the kind "knitter in the sun."</p>
<p>What nonsense seems verse, when one is seriously out of hope and
spirits! I mean that at this time I have some nonsense to write, pain of
incivility. Would to the fifth heaven no coxcombess had invented Albums.</p>
<p>I have not had a Bijoux, nor the slightest notice from Pickering about
omitting 4 out of 5 of my things. The best thing is never to hear of
such a thing as a bookseller again, or to think there are publishers:
second hand Stationers and Old Book Stalls for me. Authorship should be
an idea of the Past.</p>
<p>Old Kings, old Bishops, are venerable. All present is hollow.</p>
<p>I cannot make a Letter. I have no straw, not a pennyworth of chaff, only
this may stop your kind importunity to know about us.</p>
<p>Here is a comfortable house, but no tenants. One does not make a
household.</p>
<p>Do not think I am quite in despair, but in addition to hope protracted,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have a stupifying cold and obstructing headache, and the sun is dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I will not fail to apprise you of the revival of a Beam.</p>
<p>Meantime accept this, rather than think I have forgotten you all.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO LEIGH HUNT</strong></p>
<p>[No date. December, 1827.]</p>
<p>Dear H.,—I am here almost in the eleventh week of the longest illness
my sister ever had, and no symptoms of amendment. Some had begun, but
relapsed with a change of nurse. If she ever gets well, you will like my
house, and I shall be happy to show you Enfield country.</p>
<p>As to my head, it is perfectly at your or any one's service; either
M[e]yers' or Hazlitt's, which last (done fifteen or twenty years since)
White, of the Accountant's office, India House, has; he lives in Kentish
Town: I forget where, but is to be found in Leadenhall daily. Take your
choice. I should be proud to hang up as an alehouse sign even; or,
rather, I care not about my head or anything, but how we are to get well
again, for I am tired out.</p>
<p>God bless you and yours from the worst calamity.—Yours truly, C.L.</p>
<p>Kindest remembrances to Mrs. Hunt. H.'s is in a queer dress. M.'s would
be preferable <emphasis>ad populum</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Leigh Hunt had asked Lamb for his portrait to accompany his <emphasis>Lord Byron
and Some of His Contemporaries</emphasis>. Lamb had been painted by Hazlitt in
1804, and by Henry Meyer, full size, in May, 1826, as well as by others.
Hunt chose Meyer's picture, which was beautifully engraved, for his
book, in the large paper edition. The original is now in the India
Office; a reproduction serves as the frontispiece to this volume. The
Hazlitt portrait, representing Lamb in the garb of a Venetian senator,
is now in the National Portrait Gallery; a reproduction serves as the
frontispiece to Vol. I. of this edition.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM HONE</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. Dec. 15, 1827.]</p>
<p>My dear Hone, I read the sad accident with a careless eye, the newspaper
giving a wrong name to the poor Sufferer, but learn'd the truth from
Clarke. God send him ease, and you comfort in your thick misfortunes. I
am in a sorry state. Tis the eleventh week of the illness, and I cannot
get her well. To add to the calamity, Miss James is obliged to leave us
in a day or two. We had an Enfield Nurse for seven weeks, and just as
she seem'd mending, <emphasis>she</emphasis> was call'd away. Miss J.'s coming seem'd to
put her back, and now she is going. I do not compare my sufferings to
yours, but you see the world is full of troubles. I wish I could say a
word to comfort you. You must cling to all that is left. I fear to ask
you whether the Book is to be discontinued. What a pity, when it must
have delighted so many! Let me hear about you and it, and believe me
with deepest fellow feeling</p>

<p>My dear Allsop—Thanks for the Birds. Your announcement puzzles me sadly
as nothing came. I send you back a word in your letter, which I can
positively make nothing [of] and therefore return to you as useless. It
means to refer to the birds, but gives me no information. They are at
the fire, however.</p>
<p>My sister's illness is the most obstinate she ever had. It will not go
away, and I am afraid Miss James will not be able to stay above a day or
two longer. I am desperate to think of it sometimes. 'Tis eleven weeks!</p>
<p>The day is sad as my prospects.</p>

comfortable Xmas-day with Mary, and I can not bring myself to go from
home at present. Your kind offer, and the kind consent of the young Lady
to come, we feel as we should do; pray accept all of you our kindest
thanks: at present I think a visitor (good &amp; excellent as we remember
her to be) might a little put us out of our way. Emma is with us, and
our small house just holds us, without obliging Mary to sleep with
Becky, &amp;c.</p>
<p>We are going on extremely comfortably, &amp; shall soon be in

<p>My dear Moxon, I am at length able to tell you that we are all doing
well, and shall be able soon to see our friends as usual. If you will
venture a winter walk to Enfield tomorrow week (Sunday 3Oth) you will
find us much as usual; we intend a delicious quiet Christmas day, dull
and friendless, for we have not spirits for festivities. Pray
communicate the good news to the Hoods, and say I hope he is better. I
should be thankful for any of the books you mention, but I am so
apprehensive of their miscarriage by the stage,—at all events I want
none just now. Pray call and see Mrs. Lovekin, I heard she was ill; say
we shall be glad to see them some fine day after a week or so.</p>
<p>May I beg you to call upon Miss James, and say that we are quite well,
and that Mary hopes she will excuse her writing herself yet; she knows
that it is rather troublesome to her to write. We have rec'd her letter.

<p>My dear B.—We are all pretty well again and comfortable, and I take a
first opportunity of sending the Adventures of Ulysses, hoping that
among us—Homer, Chapman, and <emphasis>C'o</emphasis>.—we shall afford you some pleasure.
I fear, it is out of print, if not, A.K. will accept it, with wishes it
were bigger; if another copy is not to be had, it reverts to me and my
heirs <emphasis>for ever</emphasis>. With it I send a trumpery book; to which, without my
knowledge, the Editor of the Bijoux has contributed Lucy's verses: I am
asham'd to ask her acceptance of the trash accompanying it. Adieu to
Albums—for a great while, I said when I came here, and had not been
fixed two days but my Landlord's daughter (not at the Pot house)
requested me to write in her female friend's, and in her own; if I go to
[blank space: something seems to be missing] thou art there also, O all

recovering sleep, &amp;c. I do not invite or make engagements for particular
days; but I need not say how pleasant your dropping in <emphasis>any</emphasis> Sunday
morn'g would be. Perhaps Jameson would accompany you. Pray beg him to
keep an accurate record of the warning I sent by him to old Pan, for I
dread lest he should at the 12 months' end deny the warning. The house
is his daughter's, but we took it through him, and have paid the rent to
his receipts for his daughter's. Consult J. if he thinks the warning
sufficient. I am very nervous, or have been, about the house; lost my
sleep, &amp; expected to be ill; but slumbered gloriously last night golden
slumbers. I shall not relapse. You fright me with your inserted slips in
the most welcome Atlas. They begin to charge double for it, &amp; call it
two sheets. How can I confute them by opening it, when a note of yours
might slip out, &amp; we get in a hobble? When you write, write real

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. (? January, Sunday) 1828.]</p>
<p>Dear Moxon I have to thank you for despatching so much business for me.
I am uneasy respecting the enclosed receipts which you sent me and are
dated Jan. 1827. Pray get them chang'd by Mr. Henshall to 182_8_. I have
been in a very nervous way since I saw you. Pray excuse me to the Hoods
for not answering his very pleasant letter. I am very poorly. The
"Keepsake" I hope is return'd. I sent it back by Mrs. Hazlitt on
Thursday. 'Twas blotted outside when it came. The rest I think are mine.
My heart bleeds about poor Hone, that such an agreeable book, and a Book
there seem'd no reason should not go on for ever, should be given up,
and a thing substituted which in its Nature cannot last. Don't send me
any more "Companions," for it only vexes me about the Table Book. This
is not weather to hope to see any body <emphasis>to day</emphasis>, but without any
particular invitations, pray consider that we are <emphasis>at any time</emphasis> most
glad to see you, You (with Hunt's "Lord Byron" or Hazlitt's "Napoleon"
in your hand) or You simply with your switch &amp;c. The night was damnable
and the morning is not too bless-able. If you get my dates changed, I
will not trouble you with business for some time. Best of all rememb'ces
to the Hoods, with a malicious congratulation on their friend Rice's
advancem't.</p>

<p>LETTER 449</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, 25 Feb. [1828].</p>
<p>My dear Clarke,—You have been accumulating on me such a heap of
pleasant obligations that I feel uneasy in writing as to a Benefactor.
Your smaller contributions, the little weekly rills, are refreshments in
the Desart, but your large books were feasts. I hope Mrs. Hazlitt, to
whom I encharged it, has taken Hunt's Lord B. to the Novellos. His
picture of Literary Lordship is as pleasant as a disagreeable subject
can be made, his own poor man's Education at dear Christ's is as good
and hearty as the subject. Hazlitt's speculative episodes are capital; I
skip the Battles. But how did I deserve to have the Book? The
<emphasis>Companion</emphasis> has too much of Madam Pasta. Theatricals have ceased to be
popular attractions. His walk home after the Play is as good as the best
of the old Indicators. The watchmen are emboxed in a niche of fame, save
the skaiting one that must be still fugitive. I wish I could send a
scrap for good will. But I have been most seriously unwell and nervous a
long long time. I have scarce mustered courage to begin this short note,
but conscience duns me.</p>
<p>I had a pleasant letter from your sister, greatly over-acknowledging my
poor sonnet. I think I should have replied to it, but tell her I think
so. Alas for sonnetting, 'tis as the nerves are; all the summer I was
dawdling among green lanes, and verses came as thick as fancies. I am
sunk winterly below prose and zero.</p>
<p>But I trust the vital principle is only as under snow. That I shall yet
laugh again.</p>
<p>I suppose the great change of place affects me, but I could not have
lived in Town, I could not bear company.</p>
<p>I see Novello flourishes in the Del Capo line, and dedications are not
forgotten. I read the <emphasis>Atlas</emphasis>. When I pitched on the Ded'n I looked for
the Broom of "<emphasis>Cowden</emphasis> knows" to be harmonized, but 'twas summat of
Rossini's.</p>
<p>I want to hear about Hone, does he stand above water, how is his son? I
have delay'd writing to him, till it seems impossible. Break the ice for
me.</p>
<p>The wet ground here is intolerable, the sky above clear and delusive,
but under foot quagmires from night showers, and I am cold-footed and
moisture-abhorring as a cat; nevertheless I yesterday tramped to Waltham
Cross; perhaps the poor bit of exertion necessary to scribble this was
owing to that unusual bracing.</p>
<p>If I get out, I shall get stout, and then something will out —I mean
for the <emphasis>Companion</emphasis>—you see I rhyme insensibly.</p>
<p>Traditions are rife here of one Clarke a schoolmaster, and a runaway
pickle named Holmes, but much obscurity hangs over it. Is it possible
they can be any relations?</p>
<p>'Tis worth the research, when you can find a sunny day, with ground
firm, &amp;c. Master Sexton is intelligent, and for half-a-crown he'll pick
you up a Father.</p>
<p>In truth we shall be most glad to see any of the Novellian circle,
middle of the week such as can come, or Sunday, as can't. But Spring
will burgeon out quickly, and then, we'll talk more.</p>
<p>You'd like to see the improvements on the Chase, the new Cross in the
market-place, the Chandler's shop from whence the rods were fetch'd.
They are raised a farthing since the spread of Education. But perhaps
you don't care to be reminded of the Holofernes' days, and nothing
remains of the old laudable profession, but the clear, firm,
impossible-to-be-mistaken schoolmaster text hand with which is
subscribed the ever-welcome name of Chas. Cowden C. Let me crowd in
both our loves to all.                                        C.L.</p>
<p>Let me never be forgotten to include in my rememb'ces my good friend and
whilom correspondent Master Stephen.</p>
<p>How, especially, is Victoria?</p>
<p>I try to remember all I used to meet at Shacklewell. The little
household, cake-producing, wine-bringing out Emma—the old servant, that
didn't stay, and ought to have staid, and was always very dirty and
friendly, and Miss H., the counter-tenor with a fine voice, whose sister
married Thurtell. They all live in my mind's eye, and Mr. N.'s and
Holmes's walks with us half back after supper. Troja fuit!</p>

<p>["<emphasis>The Companion</emphasis>." Leigh Hunt's paper lasted only for seven months.
Madame Pasta, of whom too much was written, was Giudetta Pasta
(1798-1865), a singer of unusual compass, for whom Bellini wrote "La

<p>    But the oddest of all was the <emphasis>Sliding</emphasis> Watchman. Think of walking
    up a street in the depth of a frosty winter, with long ice in the
    gutters, and sleet over head, and then figure to yourself a sort of
    bale of a man in white, coming towards you with a lantern in one
    hand, and an umbrella over his head. It was the oddest mixture of
    luxury and hardship, of juvenility and old age! But this looked
    agreeable. Animal spirits carry everything before them; and our
    invincible friend seemed a watchman for Rabelais. Time was run at
    and butted by him like a goat. The slide seemed to bear him half
    through the night at once; he slipped from out of his box and his
    common-places at one rush of a merry thought, and seemed to say,
    "Everything's in imagination;—here goes the whole weight of my
    office."</p>

<p>[P.M. Feb. 26, 1828.]</p>
<p>My dear Robinson, It will be a very painful thing to us indeed, if you
give up coming to see us, as we fear, on account of the nearness of the
poor Lady you inquire after. It is true that on the occasion she
mentions, which was on her return from last seeing her daughter, she was
very heated and feverish, but there seems to be a great amendment in her
since, and she has within a day or two passed a quiet evening with us.
At the same time I dare not advise any thing one way or another
respecting her daughter coming to live with her. I entirely disclaim the
least opinion about it. If we named any thing before her, it was
erroneously, on the notion that <emphasis>she</emphasis> was the obstacle to the plan which
had been suggested of placing her daughter in a Private Family, <emphasis>which
seem'd your wish</emphasis>. But I have quite done with the subject. If we can be
of any amusement to the poor Lady, without self disturbance, we will.
But come and see us after Circuit, as if she were not. You have no more

to poor Hood, from whom I had a melancholy epistle yesterday; besides
that, Emma has decided objections to her own and her friend's Album
verses being published; but if she gets over that, they are decidedly

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>

<p>DEAR B.B.—You must excuse my silence. I have been in very poor health
and spirits, and cannot write letters. I only write to assure you, as
you wish'd, of my existence. All that which Mitford tells you of H.'s
book is rhodomontade, only H. has written unguardedly about me, and
nothing makes a man more foolish than his own foolish panegyric. But I
am pretty well cased to flattery, or its contrary. Neither affect[s] me
a turnip's worth. Do you see the Author of May you Like it? Do you write
to him? Will you give my present plea to him of ill health for not
acknowledge a pretty Book with a pretty frontispiece he sent me. He is
most esteem'd by me. As for subscribing to Books, in plain truth I am a
man of reduced income, and don't allow myself 12 shillings a-year to buy
OLD BOOKS with, which must be my Excuse. I am truly sorry for Murray's
demur, but I wash my hands of all booksellers, and hope to know them no
more. I am sick and poorly and must leave off, with our joint kind
remembrances to your daughter and friend A.K.                  C.L.</p>

<p>[P.M. May 3rd, 1828.]</p>
<p>Dear M.,—My friend Patmore, author of the "Months," a very pretty
publication, [and] of sundry Essays in the "London," "New Monthly," &amp;c.,
wants to dispose of a volume or two of "Tales." Perhaps they might
Chance to suit Hurst; but be that as it may, he will call upon you,
<emphasis>under favor of my recommendation</emphasis>; and as he is returning to France,
where he lives, if you can do anything for him in the Treaty line, to
save him dancing over the Channel every week, I am sure you will. I said
I'd never trouble you again; but how vain are the resolves of mortal
man! P. is a very hearty friendly fellow, and was poor John Scott's
second, as I will be yours when you want one. May you never be mine!</p>

<p>[Dated at end: 17 May (1828).]</p>
<p>Dear Walter, The sight of your old name again was like a resurrection.
It had passed away into the dimness of a dead friend. We shall be most
joyful to see you here next week,—if I understand you right—for your
note dated the 10th arrived only yesterday, Friday the <emphasis>16th</emphasis>. Suppose I
name <emphasis>Thursday</emphasis> next. If that don't suit, write to say so. A morning
coach comes from the Bell or Bell &amp; Crown by Leather Lane Holborn, and
sets you down at our house on the Chase Side, next door to Mr.
Westwood's, whom all the coachmen know.</p>
<p>I have four more notes to write, so dispatch this with again assuring
you how happy we shall be to see you, &amp; to discuss Defoe &amp; old matters.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>[No date. May, 1828.]</p>
<p>Dear Wordsworth, we had meant to have tried to see Mrs. Wordsworth and
Dora next Wednesday, but we are intercepted by a violent toothache which
Mary has got by getting up next morning after parting with you, to be
with my going off at 1/2 past 8 Holborn. We are poor travellers, and
moreover we have company (damn 'em) good people, Mr. Hone and an old
crony not seen for 20 years, coming here on Tuesday, one stays night
with us, and Mary doubts my power to get up time enough, and comfort
enough, to be so far as you are. Will you name a day in the same or
coming week that we can come to you in the morning, for it would plague
us not to see the other two of you, whom we cannot individualize from
you, before you go. It is bad enough not to see your Sister Dorothy.</p>
<p>God bless you sincerely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Robinson dates this letter 1810, but this is clearly wrong. It was
obviously written after Lamb's liberation from the India House. If, as I
suppose, the old crony is Walter Wilson, we get the date from Lamb's
letters to him and to Hone, mentioned above.</p>
<p>By "the other two of you" Lamb means Dora Wordsworth and Johnny
Wordsworth. Lamb had already seen William. The address of the present
letter is W. Wordsworth, Esq., 12 Bryanstone Street, Portman Square.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Cary, dated June 10, 1828,
declining on account of ill-health an invitation to dinner, to meet
Wordsworth. Instead he asks Cary to Enfield with Darley and Procter.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. MORGAN</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, 17 June, 1828.</p>
<p>The gentleman who brings this to you has been 12 years principal
assistant at the first School in Enfield, and bears the highest
character for carefulness and scholarship. He is about opening an
Establishment of his own, a Classical and <emphasis>Commercial</emphasis> Academy at
Peckham. He has just married a very notable and amiable young person,
our next neighbour's daughter, and I do not doubt of their final
success, but everything must have a beginning and he wants pupils. It
strikes me, that one or two of Mr. Thompson's sons may be about leaving
you,—in that case, if you can recommend my friend's school, you will
much oblige me. I can answer for the very excellent manner in which he
has conducted himself here as an assistant, for I have talked it over
with Dr. May's brother and I <emphasis>know</emphasis> him to be very learned. He will
explain to you the situation of our cottage, where we hope to see you
soon—with Mary's kind love.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MARY LAMB TO THE THOMAS HOODS</strong></p>
<p>[No date. ? Summer, 1828.]</p>
<p>My dear Friends,—My brother and Emma are to send you a partnership
letter, but as I have a great dislike to my stupid scrap at the fag end
of a dull letter, and, as I am left alone, I will say my say first; and
in the first place thank you for your kind letter; it was a mighty
comfort to me. Ever since you left me, I have been thinking I know not
what, but every possible thing that I could invent, why you should be
angry with me for something I had done or left undone during your
uncomfortable sojourn with us, and now I read your letter and think and
feel all is well again. Emma and her sister Harriet are gone to
Theobalds Park, and Charles is gone to Barnet to cure his headache,
which a good old lady has talked him into. She came on Thursday and left
us yesterday evening. I mean she was Mrs. Paris, with whom Emma's aunt
lived at Cambridge, and she had so much to [tell] her about Cambridge
friends, and to [tell] us about London ditto, that her tongue was never
at rest through the whole day, and at night she took Hood's Whims and
Oddities to bed with her and laught all night. Bless her spirits! I wish
I had them and she were as mopey as I am. Emma came on Monday, and the
week has passed away I know not how. But we have promised all the week
that we should go and see the Picture friday or saturday, and stay a
night or so with you. Friday came and we could not turn Mrs. Paris out
so soon, and on friday evening the thing was wholly given up. Saturday
morning brought fresh hopes; Mrs. Paris agreed to go to see the picture
with us, and we were to walk to Edmonton. My Hat and my <emphasis>new gown</emphasis> were
put on in great haste, and his honor, who decides all things here, would
have it that we could not get to Edmonton in time; and there was an end
of all things. Expecting to see you, I did not write.</p>
<p>Monday evening.</p>
<p>Charles and Emma are taking a second walk. Harriet is gone home. Charles
wishes to know more about the Widow. Is it to be made to match a
drawing? If you could throw a little more light on the subject, I think
he would do it, when Emma is gone; but his time will be quite taken up
with her; for, besides refreshing her Latin, he gives her long lessons
in arithmetic, which she is sadly deficient in. She leaves in a week,
unless she receives a renewal of her holydays, which Mrs. Williams has
half promised to send her. I do verily believe that I may hope to pass
the last one, or two, or three nights with you, as she is to go from
London to Bury. We will write to you the instant we receive Mrs. W.'s
letter. As to my poor sonnet—and it is a very poor sonnet, only [it]
answered very well the purpose it was written for—Emma left it behind
her, and nobody remembers more than one line of it, which is, I think,
sufficient to convince you it would make no great impression in an
Annual. So pray let it rest in peace, and I will make Charles write a
better one instead.</p>
<p>This shall go to the Post to-night. If any [one] chooses to add anything
to it they may. It will glad my heart to see you again.</p>
<p>Yours (both yours) truly and affectionately, M. LAMB.</p>
<p>Becky is going by the Post office, so I will send it away. I mean to
commence letter-writer to the family.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Mr. Hazlitt dates this letter April, 1828. The reference to the Widow,
towards the end, shows that Hood was preparing <emphasis>The Gem</emphasis>, and, what is
not generally known, that Lamb had been asked to write on that subject.
As it happened, Hood wrote the essay for him and signed it Elia (see
note below). Mrs. Paris we have met. Harriet, Emma Isola's sister, we do
not hear of again. I was recently shown a copy of Lamb's <emphasis>Works</emphasis>, 1818,
inscribed in his hand to Miss Isola: this would be Harriet Isola. Emma
had just begun her duties at Fornham, in Suffolk, where she taught the
children of a Mr. Williams, a clergyman. I cannot say what the Picture
was. The sonnet was probably that printed in the note to the letter to
Mrs. Shelley of July 26, 1827. Charles Lamb's and Emma's joint letter has
not been preserved.]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.R. HAYDON</strong></p>
<p>August, 1828.</p>
<p>Dear Haydon,—I have been tardy in telling you that your Chairing the
Member gave me great pleasure;—'tis true broad Hogarthian fun, the High
Sheriff capital. Considering, too, that you had the materials imposed
upon you, and that you did not select them from the rude world as H.
did, I hope to see many more such from your hand. If the former picture
went beyond this I have had a loss, and the King a bargain. I longed to
rub the back of my hand across the hearty canvas that two senses might
be gratified. Perhaps the subject is a little discordantly placed
opposite to another act of Chairing, where the huzzas were
Hosannahs,—but I was pleased to see so many of my old acquaintances
brought together notwithstanding.</p>
<p>Believe me, yours truly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Haydon's "Chairing the Member" was exhibited in Bond Street this year,
together with "Christ's Entry into Jerusalem," and other of his works.
"The former picture" was his "Mock Election," which the King had bought
for 500 guineas. For "Chairing the Member" Haydon received only half
that price.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter to Rickman, dated September 11, 1828, in which
Lamb thanks him for a present of nuts and apples, but is surprised that
apples should be offered to the owner of a "whole tree, almost an
orchard," and "an apple chamber redolent" to boot.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Louisa Holcroft, dated October 2,
1828, in which, so soon after Mary Lamb's determination to be the letter
writer of the family, he says, "Mary Lamb has written her last letter in
this world," adding that he has been left her <emphasis>writing legatee</emphasis>. He
calls geese "those pretty birds that look like snow in summer, and
cackle like ice breaking up."</p>
<p>Here should come a long Latin letter to Rickman, dated October 4, 1828.</p>

<p>LETTER 461</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JOHN RICKMAN</strong></p>
<p>(<emphasis>Translation</emphasis>)</p>
<p>[Postmark Oct. 3, 1828.]</p>
<p>I have been thinking of sending some kind of an answer in Latin to your
very elaborate letter, but something has arisen every day to hinder me.
To begin with our awkward friend M.B. has been with us for a while, and
every day and all day we have had such a lecture, you know how he
stutters, on legal, mind, nothing but legal notices, that I have been
afraid the Latin I want to write might prove rather barbaro-forensic
than Ciceronian. He is swallowed up, body and soul, in law; he eats,
drinks, plays (at the card table) Law, nothing but Law. He acts
Ignoramus in the play so thoroughly, that you w'd swear that in the
inmost marrow of his head (is not this the proper anatomical term?)
there have housed themselves not devils but pettifoggers, to bemuddle
with their noisy chatter his own and his friends' wits. He brought here,
'twas all his luggage, a book, Fearn on Contingent Remainders. This book
he has read so hard, and taken such infinite pains to understand, that
the reader's brain has few or no Remainders to continge. Enough,
however, of M.B. and his luggage. To come back to your claims upon me.
Your return journey, with notes, I read again and again, nor have I done
with them yet. You always make something fresh out of a hackneyed theme.
Our milestones, you say, bristle with blunders, but I must shortly
explain why I cannot comply with your directions herein.</p>
<p>Suppose I were to consult the local magnates about a matter of this
kind.—Ha! says one of our waywardens or parish overseers,—What
business is this of <emphasis>yours</emphasis>? Do you want to drop the Lodger and come out
as a Householder?—Now you must know that I took this house of mine at
Enfield, by an obvious domiciliary fiction, in my Sister's name, to
avoid the bother and trouble of parish and vestry meetings, and to
escape finding myself one day an overseer or big-wig of some sort. What
then w'd be my reply to the above question?</p>
<p>Leisure I have secured: but of dignity, not a tittle. Besides, to tell
you the truth, the aforesaid irregularities are, to my thinking, most
entertaining, and in fact very touching indeed. Here am I, quit of
worldly affairs of every kind; for if superannuation does not mean that,
what does it mean? The world then, being, as the saying is, beyond my
ken, and being myself entirely removed from any accurate distinctions of
space or time, these mistakes in road-measure do not seriously offend
me. For in the infinite space of the heavens above (which in this
contracted sphere of mine I desire to imitate so far as may be) what
need is there of milestones? Local distance has to do with mortal
affairs. In my walks abroad, limited though they must be, I am quite at
my own disposal, and on that account I have a good word for our Enfield
clocks too. Their hands generally point without any servile reference to
this Sun of our World, in his <emphasis>sub</emphasis>-Empyrean position. They strike too
just as it happens, according to their own sweet
wiles,—one—two—three—anything they like, and thus to me, a more
fortunate Whittington, they pleasantly announce, that Time, so far as I
am concerned, is no more. Here you have my reasons for not attending in
this matter to the requests of a busy subsolar such as you are.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when I reach the milestone that counts from the Hicks-Hall
that stands now, I own at once the Aulic dignity, and, were I a
gaol-bird, I should shake in my shoes. When I reach the next which
counts from the site of the old Hall, my thoughts turn to the fallen
grandeur of the pile, and I reflect upon the perishable condition of the
most imposing of human structures. Thus I banish from my soul all pride
and arrogance, and with such meditations purify my heart from day to
day. A wayfarer such as I am, may learn from Vincent Bourne, in words
terser and neater than any of mine, the advantages of milestones
properly arranged. The lines are at the end of a little poem of his,
called Milestones—(Do you remember it or shall I write it all out?)</p>
<p>        How well the Milestones' use doth this express,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which make the miles [seem] more and way seem less.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>What do you mean by this—I am borrowing hand and style from this
youngster of mine—your son, I take it. The style looks, nay on careful
inspection by these old eyes, is most clearly your very own, and the
writing too. Either R's or the Devil's. I will defer your explanation
till our next meeting—may it be soon.</p>
<p>My Latin failing me, as you may infer from erasures above, there is only
this to add. Farewell, and be sure to give Mrs. Rickman my kind
remembrances.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. October 11, 1828.]</p>
<p>A splendid edition of Bunyan's Pilgrim—why, the thought is enough to
turn one's moral stomach. His cockle hat and staff transformed to a
smart cockd beaver and a jemmy cane, his amice gray to the last Regent
Street cut, and his painful Palmer's pace to the modern swagger. Stop
thy friend's sacriligious hand. Nothing can be done for B. but to
reprint the old cuts in as homely but good a style as possible. The
Vanity Fair, and the pilgrims there—the silly soothness in his setting
out countenance—the Christian idiocy (in a good sense) of his
admiration of the Shepherds on the Delectable Mountains—the Lions so
truly Allegorical and remote from any similitude to Pidcock's. The great
head (the author's) capacious of dreams and similitudes dreaming in the
dungeon. Perhaps you don't know <emphasis>my</emphasis> edition, what I had when a child:
if you do, can you bear new designs from—Martin, enameld into copper or

<p><strong>        JOHN BUNYAN.</strong></p>
<p>Shew me such poetry in any of the 15 forthcoming combinations of show
and emptiness, yclept Annuals. Let me whisper in your ear that wholesome
sacramental bread is not more nutritious than papistical wafer stuff,
than these (to head and heart) exceed the visual frippery of Mitford's
Salamander God, baking himself up to the work of creation in a solar
oven, not yet by the terms of the context itself existing. Blake's
ravings made genteel. So there's verses for thy verses; and now let me
tell you that the sight of your hand gladdend me. I have been daily
trying to write to you, but paralysed. You have spurd me on this tiny
effort, and at intervals I hope to hear from and talk to you. But my
spirits have been in a deprest way for a long long time, and they are
things which must be to you of faith, for who can explain depression?
Yes I am hooked into the Gem, but only for some lines written on a dead
infant of the Editor's, which being as it were his property, I could not
refuse their appearing, but I hate the paper, the type, the gloss, the
dandy plates, the names of contributors poked up into your eyes in 1st
page, and whistled thro' all the covers of magazines, the barefaced sort
of emulation, the unmodest candidateship, bro't into so little space—in
those old Londons a signature was lost in the wood of matter—the paper
coarse (till latterly, which spoil'd them)—in short I detest to appear
in an Annual. What a fertile genius (an[d] a quiet good soul withal) is
Hood. He has 50 things in hand, farces to supply the Adelphi for the
season, a comedy for one of the great theatres, just ready, a whole
entertainment by himself for Mathews and Yates to figure in, a meditated
Comic Annual for next year, to be nearly done by himself.— You'd like
him very much. Wordsworth I see has a good many pieces announced in one
of em, not our Gem. W. Scott has distributed himself like a bribe haunch
among 'em. Of all the poets, Cary has had the good sense to keep quite
clear of 'em, with Clergy-gentle-manly right notions. Don't think I set
up for being proud in this point, I like a bit of flattery tickling my
vanity as well as any one. But these pompous masquerades without masks
(naked names or faces) I hate. So there's a bit of my mind. Besides they
infallibly cheat you, I mean the booksellers. If I get but a copy, I
only expect it from Hood's being my friend. Coleridge has lately been
here. He too is deep among the Prophets—the Yearservers—the mob of
Gentlemen Annuals. But they'll cheat him, I know.</p>
<p>And now, dear B.B., the Sun shining out merrily, and the dirty clouds
we had yesterday having washd their own faces clean with their own rain,
tempts me to wander up Winchmore Hill, or into some of the delightful
vicinages of Enfield, which I hope to show you at some time when you can
get a few days up to the great Town. Believe me it would give both of us
great pleasure to show you all three (we can lodge you) our pleasant
farms and villages.—</p>
<p>We both join in kindest loves to you and yours.—</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE</strong></p>
<p>[Enfield, October, 1828.]</p>
<p>Dear Clarke,—We did expect to see you with Victoria and the Novellos
before this, and do not quite understand why we have not. Mrs. N. and V.
[Vincent] promised us after the York expedition; a day being named
before, which fail'd. 'Tis not too late. The autumn leaves drop gold,
and Enfield is beautifuller—to a common eye—than when you lurked at
the Greyhound. Benedicks are close, but how I so totally missed you at
that time, going for my morning cup of ale duly, is a mystery. 'Twas
stealing a match before one's face in earnest. But certainly we had not
a dream of your appropinquity. I instantly prepared an Epithalamium, in
the form of a Sonata—which I was sending to Novello to compose—but
Mary forbid it me, as too light for the occasion—as if the subject
required anything heavy— so in a tiff with her I sent no congratulation
at all. Tho' I promise you the wedding was very pleasant news to me
indeed. Let your reply name a day this next week, when you will come as
many as a coach will hold; such a day as we had at Dulwich. My very
kindest love and Mary's to Victoria and the Novellos. The enclosed is
from a friend nameless, but highish in office, and a man whose accuracy
of statement may be relied on with implicit confidence. He wants the
<emphasis>exposé</emphasis> to appear in a newspaper as the "greatest piece of legal and
Parliamentary villainy he ever rememb'd," and he has had experience in
both; and thinks it would answer afterwards in a cheap pamphlet printed
at Lambeth in 8'o sheet, as 16,000 families in that parish are
interested. I know not whether the present <emphasis>Examiner</emphasis> keeps up the
character of exposing abuses, for I scarce see a paper now. If so, you
may ascertain Mr. Hunt of the strictest truth of the statement, at the
peril of my head. But if this won't do, transmit it me back, I beg, per
coach, or better, bring it with you. Yours unaltered, C. LAMB.</p>

<p>[Enfield, November 6, 1828.]</p>
<p>My dear Novello,—I am afraid I shall appear rather tardy in offering my
congratulations, however sincere, upon your daughter's marriage. The
truth is, I had put together a little Serenata upon the occasion, but
was prevented from sending it by my sister, to whose judgment I am apt
to defer too much in these kind of things; so that, now I have her
consent, the offering, I am afraid, will have lost the grace of
seasonableness. Such as it is, I send it. She thinks it a little too
old-fashioned in the manner, too much like what they wrote a century
back. But I cannot write in the modern style, if I try ever so hard. I
have attended to the proper divisions for the music, and you will have
little difficulty in composing it. If I may advise, make Pepusch your
model, or Blow. It will be necessary to have a good second voice, as the
stress of the melody lies there:—</p>

<p><strong>                          SERENATA, FOR TWO VOICES,</strong></p>

<empty-line/>
<p>To so great a master as yourself I have no need to suggest that the
peculiar tone of the composition demands sprightliness, occasionally
checked by tenderness, as in the second air,—</p>
<p>She smiles,—she yields,—she loves.</p>
<p>Again, you need not be told that each fifth line of the two first
recitatives requires a crescendo.</p>
<p>And your exquisite taste will prevent your falling into the error of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Purcell, who at a passage similar to <emphasis>that</emphasis> in my first air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Drops his bow, and stands to hear,</p>
<p>directed the first violin thus:—</p>
<p>Here the first violin must drop his <emphasis>bow</emphasis>.</p>
<p>But, besides the absurdity of disarming his principal performer of so
necessary an adjunct to his instrument, in such an emphatic part of the
composition too, which must have had a droll effect at the time, all
such minutiae of adaptation are at this time of day very properly
exploded, and Jackson of Exeter very fairly ranks them under the head of
puns.</p>
<p>Should you succeed in the setting of it, we propose having it performed
(we have one very tolerable second voice here, and Mr. Holmes, I dare
say, would supply the minor parts) at the Greyhound. But it must be a
secret to the young couple till we can get the band in readiness.</p>
<p>Believe me, dear Novello,</p>
<p>Yours truly,</p>

<p>Enfield, 6 Nov., '28.</p>

<p>[Mrs. Cowden Clarke remarks in her notes on this letter that the
references to Purcell and to Jackson of Exeter are inventions. For Mr.
Holmes see note above.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Laman Blanchard, dated Enfield,
November 9, 1828, thanking him for a book and dedication. Samuel Laman
Blanchard (1804-1845), afterwards known as a journalist, had just
published, through Harrison Ainsworth, a little volume entitled <emphasis>Lyric
Offerings</emphasis>, which was dedicated to Lamb. After Lamb's death Blanchard
contributed to the <emphasis>New Monthly Magazine</emphasis> some additional Popular
Fallacies.]</p>

<p>LETTER 465</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO THOMAS HOOD</strong></p>
<p>Late autumn, 1828.</p>
<p>Enfield.</p>
<p>Dear Lamb—You are an impudent varlet; but I will keep your secret. We
dine at Ayrton's on Thursday, and shall try to find Sarah and her two
spare beds for that night only. Miss M. and her tragedy may be dished:
so may not you and your rib. Health attend you.</p>
<p>Yours,                                                 T. HOOD, ESQ.</p>
<p>Miss Bridget Hood sends love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[In <emphasis>The Gem</emphasis>, 1829, in addition to his poem, "On an Infant Dying as
Soon as Born," Lamb was credited with the following piece of prose,
entitled "A Widow," which was really the work of Hood (see letter
above):—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                                 A WIDOW</strong></p>
<p>    Hath always been a mark for mockery:—a standing butt for wit to
    level at. Jest after jest hath been huddled upon her close cap, and
    stuck, like burrs, upon her weeds. Her sables are a perpetual "Black
    Joke."</p>
<p>    Satirists—prose and verse—have made merry with her bereavements.
    She is a stock character on the stage. Farce bottleth up her
    crocodile tears, or labelleth her empty lachrymatories. Comedy
    mocketh her precocious flirtations—Tragedy even girdeth at her
    frailty, and twitteth her with "the funeral baked meats coldly
    furnishing forth the marriage tables."</p>
<p>    I confess when I called the other day on my kinswoman G.—then in
    the second week of her widowhood—and saw her sitting, her young boy
    by her side, in her recent sables, I felt unable to reconcile her
    estate with any risible associations. The Lady with a skeleton
    moiety—in the old print, in Bowles' old shop window—seemed but a
    type of her condition. Her husband,—a whole hemisphere in love's
    world—was deficient. One complete side—her left—was
    death-stricken. It was a matrimonial paralysis, unprovocative of
    laughter. I could as soon have tittered at one of those melancholy
    objects that drag their poor dead-alive bodies about the streets.</p>
<p>    It seems difficult to account for the popular prejudice against lone
    women. There is a majority, I trust, of such honest, decorous
    mourners as my kinswoman: yet are Widows, like the Hebrew, a proverb
    and a byeword amongst nations. From the first putting on of the
    sooty garments, they become a stock joke—chimney-sweep or
    blackamoor is not surer—by mere virtue of their nigritude.</p>
<p>    Are the wanton amatory glances of a few pairs of graceless eyes,
    twinkling through their cunning waters, to reflect so evil a light
    on a whole community? Verily the sad benighted orbs of that noble
    relict—the Lady Rachel Russell—blinded through unserene drops for
    her dead Lord,—might atone for such oglings!</p>
<p>    Are the traditional freaks of a Dame of Ephesus, or a Wife of Bath,
    or a Queen of Denmark, to cast so broad a shadow over
    a whole sisterhood. There must be, methinks, some more general
    infirmity—common, probably, to all Eve-kind—to justify so sweeping
    a stigma.</p>
<p>    Does the satiric spirit, perhaps, institute splenetic comparisons
    between the lofty poetical pretensions of posthumous tenderness and
    their fulfilment? The sentiments of Love especially affect a high
    heroical pitch, of which the human performance can present, at best,
    but a burlesque parody. A widow, that hath lived only for her
    husband, should die with him. She is flesh of his flesh, and bone of
    his bone; and it is not seemly for a mere rib to be his survivor.
    The prose of her practice accords not with the poetry of her
    professions. She hath done with the world,—and you meet her in
    Regent Street. Earth hath now nothing left for her—but she swears
    and administers. She cannot survive him—and invests in the <emphasis>Long</emphasis>
    Annuities.</p>
<p>    The romantic fancy resents, and the satiric spirit records, these
    discrepancies. By the conjugal theory itself there ought to be no
    Widows; and, accordingly, a class, that by our milder manners is
    merely ridiculed, on the ruder banks of the Ganges is literally
    <emphasis>roasted</emphasis>.                                         C. LAMB.</p>
<p>"Miss M. and her tragedy." I fancy Miss M. would be Miss Mitford, and
her tragedy "Rienzi," produced at Drury Lane October 9, 1828. It was a
success. Hood's rib would probably be the play I have not identified.
See letter to Barton of October 11.</p>
<p>Here, a little out of its order, might come a letter from Lamb to Hood,
December 17, 1828, which is facsimiled in a privately-printed American
bibliography of Lamb, the owner of which declines to let not only me but
the Boston Bibliophile Society include it with the correspondence. In it
Lamb expresses regret, not so much that Hood had signed "The Widow" with
Lamb's name, but that an unfortunately ambiguous jest, pointed out to
him by certain friends, had crept into it. He asks that the subject may
never be referred to again.</p>
<p>Here perhaps should come a note to Miss Reynolds, Hood's sister-in-law,
accompanying Lamb's Essay on Hogarth.]</p>

<p>LETTER 466</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[No date. Dec., 1828.]</p>
<p>Dear M.,—As I see no blood-marks on the Green Lanes Road, I conclude
you got in safe skins home. Have you thought of inquiring Miss Wilson's
change of abode? Of the 2 copies of my drama I want one sent to
Wordsworth, together with a complete copy of Hone's "Table Book," for
which I shall be your debtor till we meet. Perhaps Longman will take
charge of this parcel. The other is for Coleridge at Mr. Gilman's,
Grove, Highgate, which may be sent, or, if you have a curiosity to see
him you will make an errand with it to him, &amp; tell him we mean very soon
to come &amp; see him, if the Gilmans can give or get us a bed. I am ashamed
to be so troublesome. Pray let Hood see the "Ecclectic Review"—a rogue!
The 2'd parts of the Blackwood you may make waste paper of. Yours truly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C.L.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[I do not identify Miss Wilson. Lamb's drama was "A Wife's Trial" in
<emphasis>Blackwood</emphasis> for December, 1828. The same number of the <emphasis>Eclectic Review</emphasis>
referred to Hood's parody of Lamb, "The Widow," as profaning Leslie's
picture of the widow by its "heartless ribaldry." By the 2d parts of
<emphasis>Blackwood</emphasis> Lamb referred, I imagine, to the pages on which his play was
not printed.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>LETTER 467</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. December 5, 1828.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—I am ashamed to receive so many nice Books from you, and to
have none to send you in return; You are always sending me some fruits
or wholesome pot-herbs, and mine is the garden of the Sluggard, nothing
but weeds or scarce they. Nevertheless if I knew how to transmit it, I
would send you Blackwood's of this month, which contains a little Drama,
to have your opinion of it, and how far I have improved, or otherwise,
upon its prototype. Thank you for your kind Sonnet. It does me good to
see the Dedication to a Christian Bishop. I am for a Comprehension, as
Divines call it, but so as that the Church shall go a good deal more
than halfway over to the Silent Meeting house. I have ever said that the
Quakers are the only <emphasis>Professors</emphasis> of Christianity as I read it in the
Evangiles; I say <emphasis>Professors</emphasis>—marry, as to practice, with their gaudy
hot types and poetical vanities, they are much at one with the sinful.
Martin's frontispiece is a very fine thing, let C.L. say what he please
to the contrary. Of the Poems, I like them as a volume better than any
one of the preceding; particularly, Power and Gentleness; The Present;
Lady Russell—with the exception that I do not like the noble act of
Curtius, true or false, one of the grand foundations of old Roman
patriotism, to be sacrificed to Lady R.'s taking notes on her husband's
trial. If a thing is good, why invidiously bring it into light with
something better? There are too few heroic things in this world to admit
of our marshalling them in anxious etiquettes of precedence. Would you
make a poetn on the Story of Ruth (pretty Story!) and then say, Aye, but
how much better is the story of Joseph and his Brethren! To go on, the
Stanzas to "Chalon" want the <emphasis>name</emphasis> of Clarkson in the body of them; it
is left to inference. The Battle of Gibeon is spirited again—but you
sacrifice it in last stanza to the Song at Bethlehem. Is it quite
orthodox to do so. The first was good, you suppose, for that
dispensation. Why set the word against the word? It puzzles a weak
Christian. So Watts's Psalms are an implied censure on David's. But as
long as the Bible is supposed to be an equally divine Emanation with the
Testament, so long it will stagger weaklings to have them set in
opposition. Godiva is delicately touch'd. I have always thought it a
beautiful story characteristic of old English times. But I could not
help amusing myself with the thought—if Martin had chosen this subject
for a frontispiece, there would have been in some dark corner a white
Lady, white as the Walker on the waves—riding upon some mystical
quadruped —and high above would have risen "tower above tower a massy
structure high" the Tenterden steeples of Coventry, till the poor Cross
would scarce have known itself among the clouds, and far above them all,
the distant Clint hills peering over chimney pots, piled up,
Ossa-on-Olympus fashion, till the admiring Spectator (admirer of a noble
deed) might have gone look for the Lady, as you must hunt for the other
in the Lobster. But M. should be made Royal Architect. What palaces he
would pile—but then what parliamentary grants to make them good!
ne'ertheless I like the frontispiece. The Elephant is pleasant; and I am
glad you are getting into a wider scope of subjects. There may be too
much, not religion, but too many <emphasis>good words</emphasis> into a book, till it
becomes, as Sh. says of religion, a rhapsody of words. I will just name
that you have brought in the Song to the Shepherds in four or five if
not six places. Now this is not good economy. The Enoch is fine; and
here I can sacrifice Elijah to it, because 'tis illustrative only, and
not disparaging of the latter prophet's departure. I like this best in
the Book. Lastly, I much like the Heron, 'tis exquisite: know you Lord
Thurlow's Sonnet to a Bird of that sort on Lacken water? If not, 'tis
indispensable I send it you, with my Blackwood, if you tell me how best
to send them. Fludyer is pleasant. You are getting gay and Hood-ish.
What is the Enigma? money—if not, I fairly confess I am foiled—and
sphynx must [<emphasis>here are words crossed through</emphasis>] 4 times I've tried to
write eat—eat me—and the blotting pen turns it into cat me. And now I
will take my leave with saying I esteem thy verses, like thy present,
honour thy frontispicer, and right-reverence thy Patron and Dedicatee,
and am, dear B.B.</p>
<p>                             Yours heartily,                   C.L.</p>
<p>Our joint kindest Loves to A.K. and your Daughter.</p>

<p>[Barton's new book was <emphasis>A New Year's Eve and other Poems</emphasis>, 1828,
dedicated to Charles Richard Sumner, Bishop of Winchester. This volume
contains Barton's "Fireside Quatrains to Charles Lamb" (quoted in Vol.
IV.) and also the following "Sonnet to a Nameless Friend," whom I take
to be Lamb:—</p>

<empty-line/>

    Which worth and talents such as thine should claim:</p>

<p>Martin's frontispiece represented Christ walking on the water. Lamb
recalls his remarks in a previous letter about this painter, who though
he never became Royal Architect was the originator of the present Thames
Embankment. Macaulay, in his essay on Southey's edition of the
<emphasis>Pilgrim's Progress</emphasis>, in the <emphasis>Edinburgh</emphasis> for December, 1831, makes some
very similar remarks about Martin and the way in which he would probably
paint Lear.</p>
<p>In the poem "Lady Rachel Russell; or, A Roman Hero and an English
Heroine Compared," Barton compared the act of Curtius, who leaped into
the gulf in the Forum, with Lady Russell standing beside her lord.</p>
<p>Chalon was the painter of a portrait of Thomas Clarkson.</p>
<p>The "Battle of Gibeon" is a poem inspired by Martin's picture of Joshua;
the last stanza runs thus:—</p>
<p>        Made known by marvels awfully sublime!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Yet far more glorious in the Christian's sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Than these stern terrors of the olden time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The gentler splendours of that peaceful night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When opening clouds displayed, in vision bright,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The heavenly host to Bethlehem's shepherd train,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Shedding around them more than cloudless light!</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

        Its chorus, "Peace on Earth!" its theme Messiah's reign!</p>

47, 48:—</p>

      A rhapsody of words.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I quote in the Appendix the poem which Lamb liked best. Barton had
written a poem called "Syr Heron." This is Lord Thurlow's sonnet, of
which Lamb was very fond. He quoted it in a note to his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on
the sonnets of Sidney in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, and copied it into his
album:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    TO A BIRD, THAT HAUNTED THE WATERS OF LACKEN, IN THE WINTER</strong></p>
<p>    O melancholy Bird, a winter's day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Thou standest by the margin of the pool,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And, taught by God, dost thy whole being school</p>

    To Patience, which all evil can allay.</p>

<p>"Fludyer" was a poem to Sir Charles Fludyer on the devastation effected
on his marine villa at Felixstowe by the encroachments of the sea. The
answer to the enigma, Mrs. FitzGerald (Lucy Barton) told Canon Ainger,

<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Louisa Holcroft, dated December
5, 1828. Louisa Holcroft was a daughter of Thomas Holcroft, Lamb's
friend, whose widow married Kenney. A good letter with some excellent

<p>LETTER 468</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO CHARLES COWDEN CLARKE</strong></p>
<p>[December, 1828.]</p>
<p>My dear three C.'s—The way from Southgate to Colney Hatch thro' the
unfrequentedest Blackberry paths that ever concealed their coy bunches
from a truant Citizen, we have accidentally fallen upon—the giant Tree
by Cheshunt we have missed, but keep your chart to go by, unless you
will be our conduct—at present I am disabled from further flights than
just to skirt round Clay Hill, with a peep at the fine back woods, by
strained tendons, got by skipping a skipping-rope at 53—heu mihi non
sum qualis. But do you know, now you come to talk of walks, a ramble of
four hours or so—there and back—to the willow and lavender plantations
at the south corner of Northaw Church by a well dedicated to Saint
Claridge, with the clumps of finest moss rising hillock fashion, which I
counted to the number of two hundred and sixty, and are called
"Claridge's covers"—the tradition being that that saint entertained so
many angels or hermits there, upon occasion of blessing the waters? The
legends have set down the fruits spread upon that occasion, and in the
Black Book of St. Albans some are named which are not supposed to have
been introduced into this island till a century later. But waiving the
miracle, a sweeter spot is not in ten counties round; you are knee deep
in clover, that is to say, if you are not above a middling man's height;
from this paradise, making a day of it, you go to see the ruins of an
old convent at March Hall, where some of the painted glass is yet whole
and fresh.</p>
<p>If you do not know this, you do not know the capabilities of this
country, you may be said to be a stranger to Enfield. I found it out one
morning in October, and so delighted was I that I did not get home
before dark, well a-paid.</p>
<p>I shall long to show you the clump meadows, as they are called; we might
do that, without reaching March Hall. When the days are longer, we might
take both, and come home by Forest Cross, so skirt over Pennington and
the cheerful little village of Churchley to Forty Hill.</p>
<p>But these are dreams till summer; meanwhile we should be most glad to
see you for a lesser excursion—say, Sunday next, you and <emphasis>another</emphasis>, or
if more, best on a weekday with a notice, but o' Sundays, as far as a
leg of mutton goes, most welcome. We can squeeze out a bed. Edmonton
coaches run every hour, and my pen has run out its quarter. Heartily
farewell.</p>

<p>Dear Talfourd,—You could not have told me of a more friendly thing than
you have been doing. I am proud of my namesake. I shall take care never
to do any dirty action, pick pockets, or anyhow get myself hanged, for
fear of reflecting ignominy upon your young Chrisom. I have now a motive

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO GEORGE DYER</strong></p>
<p>[No date. ? January, 1829.]</p>
<p>Dear Dyer, My very good friend, and Charles Clarke's father in law,
Vincent Novello, wishes to shake hands with you. Make him play you a
tune. He is a damn'd fine musician, and what is better, a good man and
true. He will tell you how glad we should be to have Mrs. Dyer and you
here for a few days. Our young friend, Miss Isola, has been here
holydaymaking, but leaves us tomorrow.</p>
<p>                           Yours Ever                 CH. LAMB.</p>

<p>[The date of this note is pure conjecture on my part, but is
unimportant. Novello had become Charles Clarke's father-in-law in 1828,
and Emma Isola, who was now teaching the children of a clergyman named
Williams, at Fornham, in Suffolk, spent her Christmas holidays with the
Lambs that year.</p>
<p>Here, perhaps, should come an undated letter from Lamb to Louisa Martin.
Lamb begins "Dear Monkey," and refers to his "niece," Mrs. Dowden, and
some business which she requires him to transact, Mrs. Dowden being Mrs.
John Lamb's daughter-in-law. Lamb describes himself as "a sick cat that
loves to be alone on housetops or at cellar bottoms."]</p>

<p>LETTER 471</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.W. PROCTER</strong></p>
<p>[19th Jan., 1829.]</p>
<p>My dear Procter,—I am ashamed to have not taken the drift of your
pleasant letter, which I find to have been pure invention. But jokes are
not suspected in Boeotian Enfield. We are plain people; and our talk is
of corn, and cattle, and Waltham markets. Besides, I was a little out of
sorts when I received it. The fact is, I am involved in a case which has
fretted me to death; and I have no reliance, except on you, to extricate
me. I am sure you will give me your best legal advice, having no
professional friend besides but Robinson and Talfourd, with neither of
whom at present I am on the best terms. My brother's widow left a will,
made during the lifetime of my brother, in which I am named sole
executor, by which she bequeaths forty acres of arable property, which
it seems she held under Covert Baron, unknown to my brother, to the
heirs of the body of Elizabeth Dowden, her married daughter by a first
husband, in fee-simple, recoverable by fine—<emphasis>invested</emphasis> property, mind;
for there is the difficulty—subject to leet and quit-rent; in short,
worded in the most guarded terms, to shut out the property from Isaac
Dowden, the husband. Intelligence has just come of the death of this
person in India, where he made a will, entailing this property (which
seem'd entangled enough already) to the heirs of his body, that should
not be born of his wife; for it seems by the law in India, natural
children can recover. They have put the cause into Exchequer process,
here removed by Certiorari from the native Courts; and the question is,
whether I should, as executor, try the cause here, or again re-remove it
to the Supreme Sessions at Bangalore? (which I understand I can, or
plead a hearing before the Privy Council here). As it involves all the
little property of Elizabeth Dowden, I am anxious to take the fittest
steps, and what may be least expensive. Pray assist me, for the case is
so embarrassed, that it deprives me of sleep and appetite. M. Burney
thinks there is a case like it in Chapt. 170, sect. 5, in Fearne's
Contingent Remainders. Pray read it over with him dispassionately, and
let me have the result. The complexity lies in the questionable power of
the husband to alienate….</p>
<p>I had another favour to beg, which is the beggarliest of beggings.</p>
<p>A few lines of verse for a young friend's Album (six will be enough). M.
Burney will tell you who she is I want 'em for. A girl of gold. Six
lines—make 'em eight—signed Barry C——. They need not be very good,
as I chiefly want 'em as a foil to mine. But I shall be seriously
obliged by any refuse scrap. We are in the last ages of the world, when
St. Paul prophesied that women should be "headstrong, lovers of their
own wills, having Albums." I fled hither to escape the Albumean
persecution, and had not been in my new house twenty-four hours, when
the daughter of the next house came in with a friend's Album to beg a
contribution, and the following day intimated she had one of her own.
Two more have sprung up since. If I take the wings of the morning and
fly unto the uttermost parts of the earth, there will Albums be. New
Holland has Albums. But the age is to be complied with. M.B. will tell
you the sort of girl I request the ten lines for. Somewhat of a pensive
cast, what you admire. The lines may come before the Law question, as
that can not be determined before Hilary Term, and I wish your
deliberate judgment on that. The other may be flimsy and superficial.
And if you have not burnt your returned letter, pray re-send it me, as a
monumental token of my stupidity. 'Twas a little unthinking of you to
touch upon a sore subject. Why, by dabbling in those accursed Albums, I
have become a byword of infamy all over the kingdom. I have sicken'd
decent women for asking me to write in Albums. There be "dark jests"
abroad, Master Cornwall; and some riddles may live to be clear'd up. And
'tis not every saddle is put on the right steed; and forgeries and false
Gospels are not peculiar to the Age following the Apostles. And some
tubs don't stand on their right bottoms. Which is all I wish to say in
these ticklish Times—and so your Servant,</p>

<p><strong>CHS. LAMB.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[We do not know the nature of the "bite" that Procter had put upon Lamb;
but Lamb quickly retaliated with the first paragraph of this letter,
which is mainly invention. In his <emphasis>Old Acquaintance</emphasis> Mr. Fields wrote:
"He [Procter] told me that the law question raised in this epistle was a
sheer fabrication of Lamb's, gotten up by him to puzzle his young
correspondent, the conveyancer. The coolness referred to between himself
and Robinson and Talfourd, Procter said, was also a fiction invented by
Lamb to carry out his legal mystification."</p>
<p>At the end of the first paragraph came some words in another hand: "<emphasis>in
usum</emphasis> enfeoffments whereof he was only collaterally seized, &amp;c.,"
beneath which Lamb wrote: "The above is some of M. Burney's memoranda
which he has left me, and you may cut out and give him."</p>

Ainger says that they refer to "Isola Bella, whom all poets love," the

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.W. PROCTER</strong></p>
<p>Jan. 22nd, 1829.</p>
<p>Don't trouble yourself about the verses. Take 'em coolly as they come.
Any day between this and Midsummer will do. Ten lines the extreme. There
is no mystery in my incognita. She has often seen you, though you may
not have observed a silent brown girl, who for the last twelve years has
run wild about our house in her Christmas holidays. She is Italian by
name and extraction. Ten lines about the blue sky of her country will
do, as it's her foible to be proud of it. But they must not be over
courtly or Lady-fied as she is with a Lady who says to her "go and she
goeth; come and she cometh." Item, I have made her a tolerable Latinist.
The verses should be moral too, as for a Clergyman's family. She is
called Emma Isola. I approve heartily of your turning your four vols.
into a lesser compass. 'Twill Sybillise the gold left. I shall, I think,
be in town in a few weeks, when I will assuredly see you. I will put in
here loves to Mrs. Procter and the Anti-Capulets, because Mary tells me
I omitted them in my last. I like to see my friends here. I have put my
lawsuit into the hands of an Enfield practitioner—a plain man, who
seems perfectly to understand it, and gives me hopes of a favourable
result.</p>
<p>Rumour tells us that Miss Holcroft is married; though the varlet has not
had the grace to make any communication to us on the subject. Who is
Badman, or Bed'em? Have I seen him at Montacute's? I hear he is a great
chymist. I am sometimes chymical myself. A thought strikes me with
horror. Pray heaven he may not have done it for the sake of trying
chymical experiments upon her,—young female subjects are so scarce!
Louisa would make a capital shot. An't you glad about Burke's case? We
may set off the Scotch murders against the Scotch novels—Hare, the
Great Un-hanged.</p>
<p>Martin Burney is richly worth your knowing. He is on the top scale of my
friendship ladder, on which an angel or two is still climbing, and some,
alas! descending. I am out of the literary world at present. Pray, is
there anything new from the admired pen of the author of the <emphasis>Pleasures
of Hope</emphasis>? Has Mrs. He-mans (double masculine) done anything pretty
lately? Why sleeps the lyre of Hervey, and of Alaric Watts? Is the muse
of L.E.L. silent? Did you see a sonnet of mine in Blackwood's last?
Curious construction! <emphasis>Elaborata facilitas</emphasis>! And now I'll tell. 'Twas
written for the "<emphasis>Gem</emphasis>;" but the editors declined it, on the plea that
it would <emphasis>shock all mothers</emphasis>; so they published "The Widow" instead. I
am born out of time. I have no conjecture about what the present world
calls delicacy. I thought "Rosamund Gray" was a pretty modest thing.
Hessey assures me that the world would not bear it. I have lived to grow
into an indecent character. When my sonnet was rejected, I exclaimed,
"Damn the age; I will write for Antiquity!"</p>
<p><emphasis>Erratum</emphasis> in sonnet:—Last line but something, for <emphasis>tender</emphasis>, read
<emphasis>tend</emphasis>. The Scotch do not know our law terms; but I find some remains of
honest, plain, old writing lurking there still. They were not so
mealy-mouthed as to refuse my verses. Maybe, 'tis their oatmeal.</p>
<p>Blackwood sent me £20 for the drama. Somebody cheated me out of it next
day; and my new pair of breeches, just sent home, cracking at first
putting on, I exclaimed, in my wrath, "All tailors are cheats, and all
men are tailors." Then I was better. [<emphasis>Rest lost</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>["Your four vols." Procter's poetical works, in three volumes, were
published in 1822. Since then he had issued <emphasis>The Flood of Thessaly</emphasis>,
1823. He was perhaps meditating a new one-volume selection.</p>
<p>"Anti-Capulets"—the Basil Montagus (Montacutes).</p>
<p>"Badman." Louisa Holcroft married Carlyle's friend Badams, a
manufacturer and scientific experimentalist of Birmingham, with whom the
philosopher spent some weeks in 1827 in attempting a cure for dyspepsia
(see the <emphasis>Early Recollections</emphasis>).</p>
<p>"Burke's case." William Burke and William Hare, the body-snatchers and
murderers of Edinburgh, who killed persons to sell their corpses to
Knox's school of anatomy. Burke was hanged a week later than this
letter, on January 28. Hare turned King's evidence and disappeared. A
"shot" was a subject in these men's vocabulary. The author of the
Waverley novels—the Great Unknown— had, of course, become known long
before this.</p>
<p>"M.B."—Martin Burney. In 1818 Lamb had dedicated the prose volume of
his <emphasis>Works</emphasis> to Burney, in a sonnet ending with the lines:—</p>
<p>        Free from self-seeking, envy, low design,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I have not found a whiter soul than thine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Hervey was Thomas Kibble Hervey (1799-1859), a great album poet.</p>
<p>"A sonnet of mine in Blackwood"—in the number for January, 1829 (see
below).</p>
<p>"Hessey"—of the firm of Taylor &amp; Hessey, the late publishers of the
<emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Another letter from Lamb to Procter, repeating the request for verses,
was referred to by Canon Ainger in the preface to his edition of the
correspondence. Canon Ainger printed a delightful passage. It is
disappointing not to find it among the letters proper in his latest
edition.</p>
<p>Here (had I permission from its American owner to print it, which I have
not) I should place Lamb's instructions as to playing whist drawn up for
Mrs. Badams' use and as an introduction to Captain Burney's treatise on
the game. It is a very interesting document and England has never seen
it yet.</p>
<p>The Boston Bibliophile edition also gives a letter from Lamb to Badams
apologising for his heatedness yesterday and explaining it by saying
that he had been for some hours dissuading a friend from settling at
Enfield "which friend would have attracted down crowds of literary men,
which men would have driven me wild."]</p>

lesser light (Stella, or Mrs. Star) apprehended so nigh, but that she

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO B.W. PROCTER</strong></p>
<p>[? Jan. 29th, 1829.]</p>
<p>When Miss Ouldcroft (who is now Mrs. Beddome, and Bed—dom'd to her!)
was at Enfield, which she was in summertime, and owed her health to its
sun and genial influences, she wisited (with young lady-like
impertinence) a poor man's cottage that had a pretty baby (O the
yearnling!), and gave it fine caps and sweetmeats. On a day, broke into
the parlour our two maids uproarious. "O ma'am, who do you think Miss
Ouldcroft (they pronounce it Holcroft) has been working a cap for?" "A
child," answered Mary, in true Shandean female simplicity. "It's the
man's child as was taken up for sheep-stealing." Miss Ouldcroft was
staggered, and would have cut the connection; but by main force I made
her go and take her leave of her <emphasis>protégée</emphasis> (which I only spell with a g
because I can't make a pretty j). I thought, if she went no more, the
Abactor or Abactor's wife (vide Ainsworth) would suppose she had heard
something; and I have delicacy for a sheep-stealer. The overseers
actually overhauled a mutton-pie at the baker's (his first, last, and
only hope of mutton-pie), which he never came to eat, and thence
inferred his guilt. <emphasis>Per occasionem cujus</emphasis> I framed the sonnet; observe

<p>Barry, study that sonnet. It is curiously and perversely elaborate. 'Tis
a choking subject, and therefore the reader is directed to the structure
of it. See you? and was this a fourteener to be rejected by a trumpery
annual? forsooth, 'twould shock all mothers; and may all mothers, who
would so be shocked, bed dom'd! as if mothers were such sort of

pleases) of every infant born with a neck on. Oh B.C., my whole heart is

<p>The comings in of an incipient conveyancer are not adequate to the
receipt of three twopenny post non-paids in a week. Therefore, after
this, I condemn my stub to long and deep silence, or shall awaken it to
write to lords. Lest those raptures in this honeymoon of my
correspondence, which you avow for the gentle person of my Nuncio, after
passing through certain natural grades, as Love, Love and Water, Love
with the chill off, then subsiding to that point which the heroic suitor
of his wedded dame, the noble-spirited Lord Randolph in the play,
declares to be the ambition of his passion, a reciprocation of
"complacent kindness,"—should suddenly plump down (scarce staying to
bait at the mid point of indifference, so hungry it is for distaste) to
a loathing and blank aversion, to the rendering probable such counter
expressions as this,—"Damn that infernal twopenny postman" (words which
make the not yet glutted inamorato "lift up his hands and wonder who can
use them.") While, then, you are not ruined, let me assure thee, O thou
above the painter, and next only under Giraldus Cambrensis, the most
immortal and worthy to be immortal Barry, thy most ingenious and golden
cadences do take my fancy mightily. They are at this identical moment
under the snip and the paste of the fairest hands (bating chilblains) in
Cambridge, soon to be transplanted to Suffolk, to the envy of half of
the young ladies in Bury. But tell me, and tell me truly, gentle Swain,
is that Isola Bella a true spot in geographical denomination, or a
floating Delos in thy brain? Lurks that fair island in verity in the
bosom of Lake Maggiore, or some other with less poetic name, which thou
hast Cornwallized for the occasion? And what if Maggiore itself be but a
coinage of adaptation? Of this pray resolve me immediately, for my
albumess will be catechised on this subject; and how can I prompt her?
Lake Leman, I know, and Lemon Lake (in a punch bowl) I have swum in,
though those lymphs be long since dry. But Maggiore may be in the moon.
Unsphinx this riddle for me, for my shelves have no gazetteer. And
mayest thou never murder thy father-in-law in the Trivia of Lincoln's
Inn New Square Passage, where Searl Street and the Street of Portugal
embrace, nor afterwards make absurd proposals to the Widow M. But I know
you abhor any such notions. Nevertheless so did O-Edipus (as Admiral
Burney used to call him, splitting the diphthong in spite or ignorance)
for that matter.                                             C.L.</p>

you had. Nor do I want any. Cowden, they are of the books which I give
away. What damn'd Unitarian skewer-soul'd things the general biographies
turn out. Rank and Talent you shall have when Mrs. May has done with
'em. Mary likes Mrs. Bedinfield much. For me I read nothing but
Astrea—it has turn'd my brain—I go about with a switch turn'd up at
the end for a crook; and Lambs being too old, the butcher tells me, my
cat follows me in a green ribband. Becky and her cousin are getting
pastoral dresses, and then we shall all four go about Arcadizing. O

fair! Her gold ringlets fell in a disorder superior to order!</p>

<p>Dear R.—Expectation was alert on the receit of your strange-shaped
present, while yet undisclosed from its fuse envelope. Some said,'tis a
viol da Gamba, others pronounced it a fiddle. I myself hoped it a Liquer
case pregnant with Eau de Vie and such odd Nectar. When midwifed into
daylight, the gossips were at loss to pronounce upon its species. Most
took it for a marrow spoon, an apple scoop, a banker's guinea shovel. At
length its true scope appeared, its drift— to save the backbone of my
sister stooping to scuttles. A philanthropic intent, borrowed no doubt
from some of the Colliers. You save people's backs one way, and break
'em again by loads of obligation. The spectacles are delicate and
Vulcanian. No lighter texture than their steel did the cuckoldy
blacksmith frame to catch Mrs. Vulcan and the Captain in. For ungalled
forehead, as for back unbursten, you have Mary's thanks. Marry, for my
own peculium of obligation, 'twas supererogatory. A second part of
Pamela was enough in conscience. Two Pamelas in a house is too much
without two Mr. B.'s to reward 'em.</p>

<p>Dear B.B.—I send you by desire Barley's very poetical poem. You will
like, I think, the novel headings of each scene. Scenical directions in
verse are novelties. With it I send a few <emphasis>duplicates</emphasis>, which are
<emphasis>therefore</emphasis> no value to me, and may amuse an idle hour. Read
"Christmas," 'tis the production of a young author, who reads all your
writings. A good word from you about his little book would be as balm to
him. It has no pretensions, and makes none. But parts are pretty. In
"Field's Appendix" turn to a Poem called the Kangaroo. It is in the best
way of our old poets, if I mistake not. I have just come from Town,
where I have been to get my bit of quarterly pension. And have brought
home, from stalls in Barbican, the old Pilgrim's Progress with the
prints—Vanity Fair, &amp;c.—now scarce. Four shillings. Cheap. And also
one of whom I have oft heard and had dreams, but never saw in the
flesh—that is, in sheepskin—The whole theologic works of—</p>

<p><strong>                     THOMAS AQUINAS!</strong></p>
<p>My arms aked with lugging it a mile to the stage, but the burden was a
pleasure, such as old Anchises was to the shoulders of Aeneas—or the
Lady to the Lover in old romance, who having to carry her to the top of
a high mountain—the price of obtaining her—clamber'd with her to the
top, and fell dead with fatigue.</p>
<p>O the glorious old Schoolmen!</p>
<p>There must be something in him. Such great names imply greatness. Who
hath seen Michael Angelo's things—of us that never pilgrimaged to
Rome—and yet which of us disbelieves his greatness. How I will revel in
his cobwebs and subtleties, till my brain spins!</p>

he have not seen it. Tis woefully below our editions of it. But keep it,

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MISS SARAH JAMES</strong></p>
<p>[No date. ? April, 1829.]</p>
<p>We have just got your letter. I think Mother Reynolds will go on
quietly, Mrs. Scrimpshaw having kittened. The name of the late Laureat
was Henry James Pye, and when his 1st Birthday Ode came out, which was
very poor, somebody being asked his opinion of it, said:—</p>
<p>            And when the Pye was open'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              The birds began to sing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And was not this a dainty dish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To set before the King!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pye was brother to old Major Pye, and father to Mrs. Arnold, and uncle
to a General Pye, all friends of Miss Kelly. Pye succeeded Thos. Warton,
Warton succeeded Wm. Whitehead, Whitehead succeeded Colley Cibber,
Cibber succeeded Eusden, Eusden succeeded Thos. Shadwell, Shadwell
succeeded Dryden, Dryden succeeded Davenant, Davenant God knows whom.
There never was a Rogers a Poet Laureat; there is an old living Poet of
that name, a Banker as you know, Author of the "Pleasures of Memory,"
where Moxon goes to breakfast in a fine house in the green Park, but he
was never Laureat. Southey is the present one, and for anything I know
or care, Moxon may succeed him. We have a copy of "Xmas" for you, so you
may give your own to Mary as soon as you please. We think you need not
have exhibited your mountain shyness before M.B. He is neither shy
himself, nor patronizes it in others.—So with many thanks, good-bye.
Emma comes on Thursday.                                         C.L.</p>
<p>The Poet Laureat, whom Davenant succeeded was Rare 'Ben Jonson,' who I
believe was the first regular Laureat with the appointment of £100 a
year and a Butt of Sack or Canary—so add that to my little list.—C.L.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Mr. Macdonald dates this letter December 31, 1828, perhaps rightly. I
have dated it at a venture April, 1829, because Moxon's <emphasis>Christmas</emphasis> was
published in March of that year. It is the only letter to Mary Lamb's
nurse, Miss James, that exists. Mrs. Reynolds was Lamb's aged pensioner,
whom we have met. Pye died in 1813 and was succeeded by Southey. The
author of the witticism on his first ode was George Steevens, the
critic. The comment gained point from the circumstance that Pye had
drawn largely on images from bird life in his verses.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO H. CRABB ROBINSON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. April ? 1829.]</p>
<p>Dear Robinson, we are afraid you will slip from us from England without
again seeing us. It would be charity to come and see me. I have these
three days been laid up with strong rheumatic pains, in loins, back,
shoulders. I shriek sometimes from the violence of them. I get scarce
any sleep, and the consequence is, I am restless, and want to change
sides as I lie, and I cannot turn without resting on my hands, and so
turning all my body all at once like a log with a lever. While this
rainy weather lasts, I have no hope of alleviation. I have tried
flannels and embrocation in vain. Just at the hip joint the pangs
sometimes are so excruciating, that I cry out. It is as violent as the
cramp, and far more continuous. I am ashamed to whine about these
complaints to you, who can ill enter into them. But indeed they are
sharp. You go about, in rain or fine at all hours without discommodity.
I envy you your immunity at a time of life not much removed from my own.
But you owe your exemption to temperance, which it is too late for me to
pursue. I in my life time have had my good things. Hence my frame is
brittle—yours strong as brass. I never knew any ailment you had. You
can go out at night in all weathers, sit up all hours. Well, I don't
want to moralise. I only wish to say that if you are enclined to a game
at Doubly Dumby, I would try and bolster up myself in a chair for a
rubber or so. My days are tedious, but less so and less painful than my
nights. May you never know the pain and difficulty I have in writing so
much. Mary, who is most kind, joins in the wish.</p>

poker. Never was freer from all pains and aches. Every joint sound, to
the tip of the ear from the extremity of the lesser toe. The report of
thy torments was blown circuitously here from Bury. I could not resist
the jeer. I conceived you writhing, when you should just receive my
congratulations. How mad you'd be. Well, it is not in my method to
inflict pangs. I leave that to heaven. But in the existing pangs of a
friend, I have a share. His disquietude crowns my exemption. I imagine
you howling, and pace across the room, shooting out my free arms legs
&amp;c.</p>
<p>[Illustration: Handrawn lines]</p>
<p>this way and that way, with an assurance of not kindling a spark of pain
from them. I deny that Nature meant us to sympathise with agonies. Those

<p>Dear Dyer—As well as a bad pen can do it, I must thank you for your
friendly attention to the wishes of our young friend Emma, who was
packing up for Bury when your sonnet arrived, and was too hurried to
express her sense of its merits. I know she will treasure up that and
your second communication among her choicest rarities, as from her
<emphasis>grandfather's</emphasis> friend, whom not having seen, she loves to hear talked
of. The second letter shall be sent after her, with our first parcel to
Suffolk, where she is, to us, alas dead and Bury'd; we solely miss her.
Should you at any hour think of four or six lines, to send her,
addressed to herself simply, naming her grandsire, and to wish she may
pass through life as much respected, with your own G. Dyer at the end,
she would feel rich indeed, for the nature of an Album asks for verses
that have not been in print before; but this quite at your convenience:
and to be less trouble to yourself, four lines would be sufficient.

Lucy. Your letter found me in domestic troubles. My sister is again
taken ill, and I am obliged to remove her out of the house for many
weeks, I fear, before I can hope to have her again. I have been very
desolate indeed. My loneliness is a little abated by our young friend
Emma having just come here for her holydays, and a schoolfellow of hers
that was, with her. Still the house is not the same, tho' she is the
same. Mary had been pleasing herself with the prospect of seeing her at
this time; and with all their company, the house feels at times a
frightful solitude. May you and I in no very long time have a more
cheerful theme to write about, and congratulate upon a daughter's and a
Sister's perfect recovery. Do not be long without telling me how Lucy
goes on. I have a right to call her by her quaker-name, you know.</p>
<p>Emma knows that I am writing to you, and begs to be remembered to you
with thankfulness for your ready contribution. Her album is filling
apace. But of her contributors one, almost the flower of it, a most
amiable young man and late acquaintance of mine, has been carried off by
consumption, on return from one of the Azores islands, to which he went
with hopes of mastering the disease, came back improved, went back to a
most close and confined counting house, and relapsed. His name was
Dibdin, Grandson of the Songster. You will be glad to hear that Emma,
tho' unknown to you, has given the highest satisfaction in her little
place of Governante in a Clergyman's family, which you may believe by
the Parson and his Lady drinking poor Mary's health on her birthday,
tho' they never saw her, merely because she was a friend of Emma's, and
the Vicar also sent me a brace of partridges. To get out of home themes,
have you seen Southey's Dialogues? His lake descriptions, and the
account of his Library at Keswick, are very fine. But he needed not have
called up the Ghost of More to hold the conversations with, which might
as well have pass'd between A and B, or Caius and Lucius. It is making
too free with a defunct Chancellor and Martyr.</p>
<p>I feel as if I had nothing farther to write about—O! I forget the
prettiest letter I ever read, that I have received from "Pleasures of
Memory" Rogers, in acknowledgment of a Sonnet I sent him on the Loss of
his Brother. It is too long to transcribe, but I hope to shew it you
some day, as I hope sometime again to see you, when all of us are well.
Only it ends thus "We were nearly of an age (he was the elder). He was
the only person in the world in whose eyes I always appeared young."—</p>
<p>I will now take my leave with assuring you that I am most interested in
hoping to hear favorable accounts from you.—</p>
<p>With kindest regards to A.K. and you</p>
<p>Yours truly,                                                  C.L.</p>

    could have been a greater cordial to us in our affliction than such

    familiar to him as his Alphabets: and he had the tenderest heart.
    When a flock of turkies was stolen from his farm, the indignation of
    the poor far and wide was great and loud. To me he is the greatest

Ayrton, which states that he has two young friends in the house. Here,
therefore, I think, should come a letter from Lamb to William Hazlitt,
Junior, in which Lamb says that he cannot see Mrs. Hazlitt this time. He
adds that the ladies are very pleasant. Emma Isola adds a letter which
tells us that the ladies are herself and her friend Maria. This would be
the Maria of Lamb's sonnet "Harmony in Unlikeness," evidently written at
this time (see Vol. IV.).]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>in report of Lucy's restoration. Would I could send you as good news of
my poor Lucy. But some wearisome weeks I must remain lonely yet. I have
had the loneliest time near 10 weeks, broken by a short apparition of
Emma for her holydays, whose departure only deepend the returning
solitude, and by 10 days I have past in Town. But Town, with all my
native hankering after it, is not what it was. The streets, the shops
are left, but all old friends are gone. And in London I was frightfully
convinced of this as I past houses and places—empty caskets now. I have
ceased to care almost about any body. The bodies I cared for are in
graves, or dispersed. My old Clubs, that lived so long and flourish'd so
steadily, are crumbled away. When I took leave of our adopted young
friend at Charing Cross, 'twas heavy unfeeling rain, and I had no where
to go. Home have I none—and not a sympathising house to turn to in the
great city. Never did the waters of the heaven pour down on a forlorner
head. Yet I tried 10 days at a sort of a friend's house, but it was
large and straggling—one of the individuals of my old long knot of
friends, card players, pleasant companions—that have tumbled to pieces
into dust and other things—and I got home on Thursday, convinced that I
was better to get home to my hole at Enfield, and hide like a sick cat
in my corner. Less than a month I hope will bring home Mary. She is at
Fulham, looking better in her health than ever, but sadly rambling, and
scarce showing any pleasure in seeing me, or curiosity when I should
come again. But the old feelings will come back again, and we shall
drown old sorrows over a game at Picquet again. But 'tis a tedious cut
out of a life of sixty four, to lose twelve or thirteen weeks every year
or two. And to make me more alone, our illtemperd maid is gone, who with
all her airs, was yet a home piece of furniture, a record of better
days; the young thing that has succeeded her is good and attentive, but
she is nothing—and I have no one here to talk over old matters with.
Scolding and quarreling have something of familiarity and a community of
interest—they imply acquaintance—they are of resentment, which is of
the family of dearness. I can neither scold nor quarrel at this
insignificant implement of household services; she is less than a cat,
and just better than a deal Dresser. What I can do, and do overdo, is to
walk, but deadly long are the days—these summer all-day days, with but
a half hour's candlelight and no firelight. I do not write, tell your
kind inquisitive Eliza, and can hardly read. In the ensuing Blackwood
will be an old rejected farce of mine, which may be new to you, if you
see that same dull Medley. What things are all the Magazines now! I
contrive studiously not to see them. The popular New Monthly is perfect
trash. Poor Hessey, I suppose you see, has failed. Hunt and Clarke too.
Your "Vulgar truths" will be a good name—and I think your prose must
please—me at least—but 'tis useless to write poetry with no
purchasers. 'Tis cold work Authorship without something to puff one into
fashion. Could you not write something on Quakerism—for Quakers to
read—but nominally addrest to Non Quakers? explaining your
dogmas—waiting on the Spirit—by the analogy of human calmness and
patient waiting on the judgment? I scarcely know what I mean, but to
make Non Quakers reconciled to your doctrines, by shewing something like
them in mere human operations—but I hardly understand myself, so let it
pass for nothing. I pity you for over-work, but I assure you no-work is
worse. The mind preys on itself, the most unwholesome food. I brag'd
formerly that I could not have too much time. I have a surfeit. With few
years to come, the days are wearisome. But weariness is not eternal.
Something will shine out to take the load off, that flags me, which is
at present intolerable. I have killed an hour or two in this poor
scrawl. I am a sanguinary murderer of time, and would kill him inchmeal
just now. But the snake is vital. Well, I shall write merrier
anon.—'Tis the present copy of my countenance I send—and to complain
is a little to alleviate.—May you enjoy yourself as far as the wicked
wood will let you—and think that you are not quite alone, as I am.
Health to Lucia and to Anna and kind rememb'ces.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JAMES GILLMAN</strong></p>
<p>Chase-Side, Enfield, 26th Oct., 1829.</p>
<p>Dear Gillman,—Allsop brought me your kind message yesterday. How can I
account for having not visited Highgate this long time? Change of place
seemed to have changed me. How grieved I was to hear in what indifferent
health Coleridge has been, and I not to know of it! A little school
divinity, well applied, may be healing. I send him honest Tom of Aquin;
that was always an obscure great idea to me: I never thought or dreamed
to see him in the flesh, but t'other day I rescued him from a stall in
Barbican, and brought him off in triumph. He comes to greet Coleridge's
acceptance, for his shoe-latchets I am unworthy to unloose. Yet there
are pretty pro's and con's, and such unsatisfactory learning in him.
Commend me to the question of etiquette— "<emphasis>utrum annunciatio debuerit
fieri per angelum</emphasis>"—<emphasis>Quaest. 30, Articilus 2</emphasis>. I protest, till now I
had thought Gabriel a fellow of some mark and livelihood, not a simple
esquire, as I find him. Well, do not break your lay brains, nor I
neither, with these curious nothings. They are nuts to our dear friend,
whom hoping to see at your first friendly hint that it will be
convenient, I end with begging our very kindest loves to Mrs. Gillman.
We have had a sorry house of it here. Our spirits have been reduced till
we were at hope's end what to do— obliged to quit this house, and
afraid to engage another, till in extremity I took the desperate resolve
of kicking house and all down, like Bunyan's pack; and here we are in a
new life at board and lodging, with an honest couple our neighbours. We
have ridded ourselves of the cares of dirty acres; and the change,
though of less than a week, has had the most beneficial effects on Mary
already. She looks two years and a half younger for it. But we have had
sore trials.</p>

<p>LETTER 494</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WALTER WILSON</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, 15th November, 1829.</p>
<p>My dear Wilson,—I have not opened a packet of unknown contents for many
years, that gave me so much pleasure as when I disclosed your three
volumes. I have given them a careful perusal, and they have taken their
degree of classical books upon my shelves. De Foe was always my darling;
but what darkness was I in as to far the larger part of his writings! I
have now an epitome of them all. I think the way in which you have done
the "Life" the most judicious you could have pitched upon. You have made
him tell his own story, and your comments are in keeping with the tale.
Why, I never heard of such a work as "the Review." Strange that in my
stall-hunting days I never so much as lit upon an odd volume of it. This
circumstance looks as if they were never of any great circulation. But I
may have met with 'em, and not knowing the prize, overpast 'em. I was
almost a stranger to the whole history of Dissenters in those reigns,
and picked my way through that strange book the "Consolidator" at
random. How affecting are some of his personal appeals! what a machine
of projects he set on foot! and following writers have picked his pocket
of the patents. I do not understand where-abouts in <emphasis>Roxana</emphasis> he himself
left off. I always thought the complete-tourist-sort of description of
the town she passes through on her last embarkation miserably
unseasonable and out of place. I knew not they were spurious. Enlighten
me as to where the apocryphal matter commences. I, by accident, can
correct one A.D. "Family Instructor," vol. ii. 1718; you say his first
volume had then reached the fourth edition; now I have a fifth, printed
for Eman. Matthews, 1717. So have I plucked one rotten date, or rather
picked it up where it had inadvertently fallen, from your flourishing
date tree, the Palm of Engaddi. I may take it for my pains. I think
yours a book which every public library must have, and every English
scholar should have. I am sure it has enriched my meagre stock of the
author's works. I seem to be twice as opulent. Mary is by my side just
finishing the second volume. It must have interest to divert her away so
long from her modern novels. Colburn will be quite jealous. I was a
little disappointed at my "Ode to the Treadmill" not finding a place;
but it came out of time. The two papers of mine will puzzle the reader,
being so akin. Odd that, never keeping a scrap of my own letters, with
some fifteen years' interval I should nearly have said the same things.
But I shall always feel happy in having my name go down any how with De
Foe's, and that of his historiographer. I promise myself, if not
immortality, yet diuternity of being read in consequence. We have both
had much illness this year; and feeling infirmities and fretfulness grow
upon us, we have cast off the cares of housekeeping, sold off our goods,
and commenced boarding and lodging with a very comfortable old couple
next door to where you found us. We use a sort of common table.
Nevertheless, we have reserved a private one for an old friend; and when
Mrs. Wilson and you revisit Babylon, we shall pray you to make it yours
for a season. Our very kindest remembrances to you both. From your old
friend and <emphasis>fellow-journalist</emphasis>, now in <emphasis>two instances</emphasis>,</p>

<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>Hazlitt is going to make your book a basis for a review of De Foe's
Novels in the "Edinbro'." I wish I had health and spirits to do it. Hone
I have not seen, but I doubt not he will be much pleased with your
performance. I very much hope you will give us an account of Dunton, &amp;c.
But what I should more like to see would be a Life and Times of Bunyan.
Wishing health to you and long life to your healthy book, again I
subscribe me,</p>
<p>Yours in verity,</p>

<p>LETTER 496</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JAMES GILLMAN</strong></p>
<p>30 Nov., 1829.</p>
<p>Dear G.,—The excursionists reached home, and the good town of Enfield a
little after four, without slip or dislocation. Little has transpired
concerning the events of the back-journey, save that on passing the
house of 'Squire Mellish, situate a stone-bow's cast from the hamlet,
Father Westwood, with a good-natured wonderment, exclaimed, "I cannot
think what is gone of Mr. Mellish's rooks. I fancy they have taken
flight somewhere; but I have missed them two or three years past." All
this while, according to his fellow-traveller's report, the rookery was
darkening the air above with undiminished population, and deafening all
ears but his with their cawings. But nature has been gently withdrawing
such phenomena from the notice of Thomas Westwood's senses, from the
time he began to miss the rooks. T. Westwood has passed a retired life
in this hamlet of thirty or forty years, living upon the minimum which
is consistent with gentility, yet a star among the minor gentry,
receiving the bows of the tradespeople and courtesies of the alms' women
daily. Children venerate him not less for his external show of gentry,
than they wonder at him for a gentle rising endorsation of the person,
not amounting to a hump, or if a hump, innocuous as the hump of the
buffalo, and coronative of as mild qualities. 'Tis a throne on which
patience seems to sit—the proud perch of a self-respecting humility,
stooping with condescension. Thereupon the cares of life have sate, and
rid him easily. For he has thrid the <emphasis>angustiae domûs</emphasis> with dexterity.
Life opened upon him with comparative brilliancy. He set out as a rider
or traveller for a wholesale house, in which capacity he tells of many
hair-breadth escapes that befell him; one especially, how he rode a mad
horse into the town of Devizes; how horse and rider arrived in a foam,
to the utter consternation of the expostulating hostlers, inn-keepers,
&amp;c. It seems it was sultry weather, piping hot; the steed tormented into
frenzy with gad-flies, long past being roadworthy; but safety and the
interest of the house he rode for were incompatible things; a fall in
serge cloth was expected; and a mad entrance they made of it. Whether
the exploit was purely voluntary, or partially; or whether a certain
personal defiguration in the man part of this extraordinary centaur
(non-assistive to partition of natures) might not enforce the
conjunction, I stand not to inquire. I look not with 'skew eyes into the
deeds of heroes. The hosier that was burnt with his shop, in Field-lane,
on Tuesday night, shall have past to heaven for me like a Marian Martyr,
provided always, that he consecrated the fortuitous incremation with a
short ejaculation in the exit, as much as if he had taken his state
degrees of martyrdom <emphasis>in formâ</emphasis> in the market vicinage. There is
adoptive as well as acquisitive sacrifice. Be the animus what it might,
the fact is indisputable, that this composition was seen flying all
abroad, and mine host of Daintry may yet remember its passing through
his town, if his scores are not more faithful than his memory. After
this exploit (enough for one man), Thomas Westwood seems to have
subsided into a less hazardous occupation; and in the twenty-fifth year
of his age we find him a haberdasher in Bow Lane: yet still retentive of
his early riding (though leaving it to rawer stomachs), and Christmasly
at night sithence to this last, and shall to his latest Christmas, hath
he, doth he, and shall he, tell after supper the story of the insane
steed and the desperate rider. Save for Bedlam or Luke's no eye could
have guessed that melting day what house he rid for. But he reposes on
his bridles, and after the ups and downs (metaphoric only) of a life
behind the counter—hard riding sometimes, I fear, for poor T.W.—with
the scrapings together of the shop, and <emphasis>one anecdote</emphasis>, he hath finally
settled at Enfield; by hard economising, gardening, building for
himself, hath reared a mansion, married a daughter, qualified a son for
a counting-house, gotten the respect of high and low, served for self or
substitute the greater parish offices: hath a special voice at vestries;
and, domiciliating us, hath reflected a portion of his house-keeping
respectability upon your humble servants. We are greater, being his
lodgers, than when we were substantial renters. His name is a passport
to take off the sneers of the native Enfielders against obnoxious
foreigners. We are endenizened. Thus much of T. Westwood have I thought
fit to acquaint you, that you may see the exemplary reliance upon
Providence with which I entrusted so dear a charge as my own sister to
the guidance of a man that rode the mad horse into Devizes. To come from
his heroic character, all the amiable qualities of domestic life
concentre in this tamed Bellerophon. He is excellent over a glass of
grog; just as pleasant without it; laughs when he hears a joke, and when
(which is much oftener) he hears it not; sings glorious old sea songs on
festival nights; and but upon a slight acquaintance of two years,
Coleridge, is as dear a deaf old man to us, as old Norris, rest his
soul! was after fifty. To him and his scanty literature (what there is
of it, <emphasis>sound</emphasis>) have we flown from the metropolis and its cursed
annualists, reviewers, authors, and the whole muddy ink press of that
stagnant pool.</p>
<p>Now, Gillman again, you do not know the treasure of the Fullers. I
calculate on having massy reading till Christmas. All I want here, is
books of the true sort, not those things in boards that moderns mistake

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. December 8, 1829.]</p>
<p>My dear B.B.—You are very good to have been uneasy
about us, and I have the satisfaction to tell you, that we
are both in better health and spirits than we have been for a year
or two past; I may say, than we have been since we have been
at Enfield. The cause may not appear quite adequate, when
I tell you, that a course of ill health and spirits brought us to the
determination of giving up our house here, and we are boarding
and lodging with a worthy old couple, long inhabitants
of Enfield, where everything is done for us without our trouble,
further than a reasonable weekly payment. We should have
done so before, but it is not easy to flesh and blood to give up an
ancient establishment, to discard old Penates, and from house
keepers to turn house-sharers. (N.B. We are not in the Work-house.)
Dioclesian in his garden found more repose than
on the imperial seat of Rome, and the nob of Charles the Fifth
aked seldomer under a monk's cowl than under the diadem.
With such shadows of assimilation we countenance our degradation.
With such a load of dignifyd cares just removed from
our shoulders, we can the more understand and pity the accession
to yours, by the advancement to an Assigneeship. I will
tell you honestly B.B. that it has been long my deliberate judgment,
that all Bankrupts, of what denomination civil or religious
whatever, ought to be hang'd. The pity of mankind has for
ages run in a wrong channel, and has been diverted from poor
Creditors (how many I have known sufferers! Hazlitt has just
been defrauded of £100 by his Bookseller-friend's breaking)
to scoundrel Debtors. I know all the topics, that distress may
come upon an honest man without his fault, that the failure of
one that he trusted was his calamity &amp;c. &amp;c. Then let <emphasis>both</emphasis> be
hang'd. O how careful it would make traders! These are
my deliberate thoughts after many years' experience in matters
of trade. What a world of trouble it would save you, if Friend
* * * * * had been immediately hangd, without benefit of
clergy, which (being a Quaker I presume) he could not
reasonably insist upon. Why, after slaving twelve months
in your assign-business, you will be enabled to declare seven
pence in the Pound in all human probabilty. B.B., he should
be <emphasis>hanged</emphasis>. Trade will never re-flourish in this land till such
a Law is establish'd. I write big not to save ink but eyes,
mine having been troubled with reading thro' three folios of
old Fuller in almost as few days, and I went to bed last
night in agony, and am writing with a vial of eye water before
me, alternately dipping in vial and inkstand. This may enflame
my zeal against Bankrupts—but it was my speculation when
I could see better. Half the world's misery (Eden else) is
owing to want of money, and all that want is owing to Bankrupts.
I declare I would, if the State wanted Practitioners,
turn Hangman myself, and should have great pleasure in
hanging the first after my salutary law should be establish'd.
I have seen no annuals and wish to see none. I like your
fun upon them, and was quite pleased with Bowles's sonnet.
Hood is or was at Brighton, but a note, prose or rhime, to him,
Robert Street, Adelphi, I am sure would extract a copy of
<emphasis>his</emphasis>, which also I have not seen. Wishing you and yours all
Health, I conclude while these frail glasses are to me—eyes.</p>

<p>LETTER 498</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. January 22, 1830.]</p>
<p>And is it a year since we parted from you at the steps of Edmonton
Stage? There are not now the years that there used to be. The tale of
the dwindled age of men, reported of successional mankind, is true of
the same man only. We do not live a year in a year now. 'Tis a punctum
stans. The seasons pass us with indifference. Spring cheers not, nor
winter heightens our gloom, Autumn hath foregone its moralities, they
are hey-pass re-pass [as] in a show-box. Yet as far as last year occurs
back, for they scarce shew a reflex now, they make no memory as
heretofore—'twas sufficiently gloomy. Let the sullen nothing pass.</p>
<p>Suffice it that after sad spirits prolonged thro' many of its months, as
it called them, we have cast our skins, have taken a farewell of the
pompous troublesome trifle calld housekeeping, and are settled down into
poor boarders and lodgers at next door with an old couple, the Baucis
and Baucida of dull Enfield. Here we have nothing to do with our
victuals but to eat them, with the garden but to see it grow, with the
tax gatherer but to hear him knock, with the maid but to hear her
scolded. Scot and lot, butcher, baker, are things unknown to us save as
spectators of the pageant. We are fed we know not how, quietists,
confiding ravens. We have the otium pro dignitate, a respectable
insignificance. Yet in the self condemned obliviousness, in the
stagnation, some molesting yearnings of life, not quite kill'd, rise,
prompting me that there was a London, and that I was of that old
Jerusalem. In dreams I am in Fleetmarket, but I wake and cry to sleep
again. I die hard, a stubborn Eloisa in this detestable Paraclete. What
have I gained by health? intolerable dulness. What by early hours and
moderate meals?—a total blank. O never let the lying poets be believed,
who 'tice men from the chearful haunts of streets—or think they mean it
not of a country village. In the ruins of Palmyra I could gird myself up
to solitude, or muse to the snorings of the Seven Sleepers, but to have
a little teazing image of a town about one, country folks that do not
look like country folks, shops two yards square, half a dozen apples and
two penn'orth of overlookd gingerbread for the lofty fruiterers of
Oxford Street—and, for the immortal book and print stalls, a
circulating library that stands still, where the shew-picture is a last
year's Valentine, and whither the fame of the last ten Scotch novels has
not yet travel'd (marry, they just begin to be conscious of the Red
Gauntlet), to have a new plasterd flat church, and to be wishing that it
was but a Cathedral. The very blackguards here are degenerate. The
topping gentry, stock brokers. The passengers too many to ensure your
quiet, or let you go about whistling, or gaping—too few to be the fine
indifferent pageants of Fleet Street. Confining, room-keeping thickest
winter is yet more bearable here than the gaudy months. Among one's
books at one's fire by candle one is soothed into an oblivion that one
is not in the country, but with the light the green fields return, till
I gaze, and in a calenture can plunge myself into Saint Giles's. O let
no native Londoner imagine that health, and rest, and innocent
occupation, interchange of converse sweet and recreative study, can make
the country any thing better than altogether odious and detestable. A
garden was the primitive prison till man with promethean felicity and
boldness luckily sinn'd himself out of it. Thence followd Babylon,
Nineveh, Venice, London, haberdashers, goldsmiths, taverns, playhouses,
satires, epigrams, puns—these all came in on the town part, and the
thither side of innocence. Man found out inventions.</p>
<p>From my den I return you condolence for your decaying sight, not for any
thing there is to see in the country, but for the miss of the pleasure
of reading a London newspaper. The poets are as well to listen to, any
thing high may, nay must, be read out—you read it to yourself with an
imaginary auditor—but the light paragraphs must be glid over by the
proper eye, mouthing mumbles their gossamery substance. 'Tis these
trifles I should mourn in fading sight. A newspaper is the single gleam
of comfort I receive here, it comes from rich Cathay with tidings of
mankind. Yet I could not attend to it read out by the most beloved
voice. But your eyes do not get worse, I gather. O for the collyrium of
Tobias inclosed in a whiting's liver to send you with no apocryphal good
wishes! The last long time I heard from you, you had knock'd your head
against something. Do not do so. For your head (I do not flatter) is not
a nob, or the top of a brass nail, or the end of a nine pin—unless a
Vulcanian hammer could fairly batter a Recluse out of it, then would I
bid the smirch'd god knock and knock lustily, the two-handed skinker.
What a nice long letter Dorothy has written! Mary must squeeze out a
line propriâ manu, but indeed her fingers have been incorrigibly nervous
to letter writing for a long interval. 'Twill please you all to hear
that, tho' I fret like a lion in a net, her present health and spirits
are better than they have been for some time past: she is absolutely
three years and a half younger, as I tell her, since we have adopted
this boarding plan. Our providers are an honest pair, dame Westwood and
her husband—he, when the light of prosperity shined on them, a
moderately thriving haberdasher within Bow Bells, retired since with
something under a competence, writes himself parcel gentleman, hath
borne parish offices, sings fine old sea songs at threescore and ten,
sighs only now and then when he thinks that he has a son on his hands
about 15, whom he finds a difficulty in getting out into the world, and
then checks a sigh with muttering, as I once heard him prettily, not
meaning to be heard, "I have married my daughter however,"—takes the
weather as it comes, outsides it to town in severest season, and a'
winter nights tells old stories not tending to literature, how
comfortable to author-rid folks! and has <emphasis>one anecdote</emphasis>, upon which and
about forty pounds a year he seems to have retired in green old age. It
was how he was a <emphasis>rider</emphasis> in his youth, travelling for shops, and once
(not to baulk his employer's bargain) on a sweltering day in August,
rode foaming into Dunstable upon a <emphasis>mad horse</emphasis> to the dismay and
expostulary wonderment of innkeepers, ostlers &amp;c. who declared they
would not have bestrid the beast to win the Darby. Understand the
creature gall'd to death and desperation by gad flies, cormorants
winged, worse than beset Inachus' daughter. This he tells, this he
brindles and burnishes on a' winter's eves, 'tis his star of set glory,
his rejuvenescence to descant upon. Far from me be it (dii avertant) to
look a gift story in the mouth, or cruelly to surmise (as those who
doubt the plunge of Curtius) that the inseparate conjuncture of man and
beast, the centaur-phenomenon that staggerd all Dunstable, might have
been the effect of unromantic necessity, that the horse-part carried the
reasoning, willy nilly, that needs must when such a devil drove, that
certain spiral configurations in the frame of Thomas Westwood unfriendly
to alighting, made the alliance more forcible than voluntary. Let him
enjoy his fame for me, nor let me hint a whisper that shall dismount
Bellerophon. Put case he was an involuntary martyr, yet if in the fiery
conflict he buckled the soul of a constant haberdasher to him, and
adopted his flames, let Accident and He share the glory! You would all
like Thomas Westwood.</p>
<p>[Illustration: Hand drawn sketch]</p>
<p>How weak is painting to describe a man! Say that he stands four feet and
a nail high by his own yard measure, which like the Sceptre of Agamemnon
shall never sprout again, still you have no adequate idea, nor when I
tell you that his dear hump, which I have favord in the picture, seems
to me of the buffalo—indicative and repository of mild qualities, a
budget of kindnesses, still you have not the man. Knew you old Norris of
the Temple, 60 years ours and our father's friend, he was not more
natural to us than this old W. the acquaintance of scarce more weeks.
Under his roof now ought I to take my rest, but that back-looking
ambition tells me I might yet be a Londoner. Well, if we ever do move,
we have encumbrances the less to impede us: all our furniture has faded
under the auctioneer's hammer, going for nothing like the tarnishd
frippery of the prodigal, and we have only a spoon or two left to bless
us. Clothed we came into Enfield, and naked we must go out of it. I
would live in London shirtless, bookless. Henry Crabb is at Rome,
advices to that effect have reach'd Bury. But by solemn legacy he
bequeath'd at parting (whether he should live or die) a Turkey of
Suffolk to be sent every succeeding Xmas to us and divers other friends.
What a genuine old Bachelor's action! I fear he will find the air of
Italy too classic. His station is in the Hartz forest, his soul is
<emphasis>Bego'ethed</emphasis>. Miss Kelly we never see; Talfourd not this half-year; the
latter flourishes, but the exact number of his children, God forgive me,
I have utterly forgotten, we single people are often out in our count
there. Shall I say two? One darling I know they have lost within a
twelvemonth, but scarce known to me by sight, and that was a second
child lost. We see scarce anybody. We have just now Emma with us for her
holydays; you remember her playing at brag with Mr. Quillinan at poor
Monkhouse's! She is grown an agreeable young woman; she sees what I
write, so you may understand me with limitations. She was our inmate for
a twelvemonth, grew natural to us, and then they told us it was best for
her to go out as a Governess, and so she went out, and we were only two
of us, and our pleasant house-mate is changed to an occasional visitor.
If they want my sister to go out (as they call it) there will be only
one of us. Heaven keep us all from this acceding to Unity!</p>

<p>(<emphasis>Same letter</emphasis>)</p>
<p>My dear Miss Wordsworth, Charles has left me space to fill up with my
own poor scribble; which I must do as well as I can, being quite out of
practise, and after he has been reading his queer letter out to us I can
hardly put down in a plain style all I had to tell you, how pleasant
your handwriting was to me. He has lumped you all together in one rude
remembrance at the end, but I beg to send my love individually and by
name to Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth, to Miss Hutchinson, whom we often talk
of, and think of as being with you always, to the dutiful good daughter
and patient amanuensis Dora, and even to Johanna, whom we have not seen,
if she will accept it. Charles has told you of my long illness and our
present settlement, which I assure you is very quiet and comfortable to
me, and to him too, if he would own it. I am very sorry we shall not see
John, but I never go to town, nor my brother but at his quarterly visits
at the India House, and when he does, he finds it melancholy, so many of
our old friends being dead or dispersed, and the very streets, he says
altering every day. Many thanks for your Letter and the nice news in it,
which I should have replied to more at large than I see he has done. I
am sure it deserved it. He has not said a word about your intentions for
Rome, which I sincerely wish you health one day to accomplish. In that
case we may meet by the way. We are so glad to hear dear <emphasis>little</emphasis>
William is doing well. If you knew how happy your letters made us you
would write I know more frequently. Pray think of this. How chearfully

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. 25 February, 1830.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—To reply to you by return of post, I must gobble up my
dinner, and dispatch this in propriâ Personâ to the office, to be in
time. So take it from me hastily, that you are perfectly welcome to
furnish A.C. with the scrap, which I had almost forgotten writing. The
more my character comes to be known, the less my veracity will come to
be suspected. Time every day clears up some suspected narrative of
Herodotus, Bruce, and others of us great Travellers. Why, that Joseph
Paice was as real a person as Joseph Hume, and a great deal pleasanter.
A careful observer of life, Bernard, has no need to invent. Nature
romances it for him. Dinner plates rattle, and I positively shall incur
indigestion by carrying it half concocted to the Post House. Let me
congratulate you on the Spring coming in, and do you in return condole
with me for the Winter going out. When the old one goes, seldome comes a
better. I dread the prospect of Summer, with his all day long days. No
need of his assistance to make country places dull. With fire and candle
light, I can dream myself in Holborn. With lightsome skies shining in to
bed time, I can not. This Meseck, and these tents of Kedar—I would
dwell in the skirts of Jericho rather, and think every blast of the
coming in Mail a Ram's Horn. Give me old London at Fire and Plague
times, rather than these tepid gales, healthy country air, and
purposeless exercise. Leg of mutton absolutely on the table.</p>

<p>Dear Madam,—May God bless you for your attention to our poor Emma! I am
so shaken with your sad news I can scarce write. She is too ill to be
removed at present; but we can only say that if she is spared, when that
can be practicable, we have always a home for her. Speak to her of it,
when she is capable of understanding, and let me conjure you to let us
know from day to day, the state she is in. But one line is all we crave.
Nothing we can do for her, that shall not be done. We shall be in the
terriblest suspense. We had no notion she was going to be ill. A line
from anybody in your house will much oblige us. I feel for the situation
this trouble places you in.</p>
<p>Can I go to her aunt, or do anything? I do not know what to offer. We
are in great distress. Pray relieve us, if you can, by somehow letting
us know. I will fetch her here, or anything. Your kindness can never be

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. WILLIAMS</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, 1 March, 1830.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,—We cannot thank you enough. Your two words "much better"
were so considerate and good. The good news affected my sister to an
agony of tears; but they have relieved us from such a weight. We were
ready to expect the worst, and were hardly able to bear the good
hearing. You speak so kindly of her, too, and think she may be able to
resume her duties. We were prepared, as far as our humble means would
have enabled us, to have taken her from all duties. But, far better for
the dear girl it is that she should have a prospect of being useful.</p>
<p>I am sure you will pardon my writing again; for my heart is so full,
that it was impossible to refrain. Many thanks for your offer to write
again, should any change take place. I dare not yet be quite out of
fear, the alteration has been so sudden. But I will hope you will have a
respite from the trouble of writing again. I know no expression to
convey a sense of your kindness. We were in such a state expecting the
post. I had almost resolved to come as near you as Bury; but my sister's
health does not permit my absence on melancholy occasions. But, O, how
happy will she be to part with me, when I shall hear the agreeable news
that I may come and fetch her. She shall be as quiet as possible. No
restorative means shall be wanting to restore her back to you well and
comfortable.</p>
<p>She will make up for this sad interruption of her young friend's
studies. I am sure she will—she must—after you have spared her for a
little time. Change of scene may do very much for her. I think this last
proof of your kindness to her in her desolate state can hardly make her
love and respect you more than she has ever done. O, how glad shall we
be to return her fit for her occupation. Madam, I trouble you with my
nonsense; but you would forgive me, if you knew how light-hearted you
have made two poor souls at Enfield, that were gasping for news of their
poor friend. I will pray for you and Mr. Williams. Give our very best
respects to him, and accept our thanks. We are happier than we hardly
know how to bear. God bless you! My very kindest congratulations to Miss
Humphreys.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SARAH HAZLITT</strong></p>

<p>Dear Sarah,—I was meditating to come and see you, but I am unable for
the walk. We are both very unwell, and under affliction for poor Emma,
who has had a very dangerous brain fever, and is lying very ill at Bury,
from whence I expect a summons to fetch her. We are very sorry for your
confinement. Any books I have are at your service. I am almost, I may
say <emphasis>quite</emphasis>, sure that letters to India pay no postage, and may go by
the regular Post Office, now in St. Martin's le Grand. I think any
receiving house would take them—</p>
<p>I wish I could confirm your hopes about Dick Norris. But it is quite a
dream. Some old Bencher of his surname is made <emphasis>Treasurer</emphasis> for the year,
I suppose, which is an annual office. Norris was Sub-Treasurer, quite a
different thing. They were pretty well in the Summer, since when we have
heard nothing of them. Mrs. Reynolds is better than she has been for
years; she is with a disagreeable woman that she has taken a mighty
fancy to out of spite to a rival woman she used to live and quarrel
with; she grows quite <emphasis>fat</emphasis>, they tell me, and may live as long as I do,
to be a tormenting rent-charge to my diminish'd income. We go on pretty
comfortably in our new plan. I will come and have a talk with you when
poor Emma's affair is settled, and will bring books. At present I am
weak, and could hardly bring my legs home yesterday after a much shorter
stroll than to Northaw. Mary has got her bonnet on for a short
expedition. May you get better, as the Spring comes on. She sends her
best love with mine.</p>

<p>Enfield, 5 Mar., 1830.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,—I feel greatly obliged by your letter of Tuesday, and
should not have troubled you again so soon, but that you express a wish
to hear that our anxiety was relieved by the assurances in it. You have
indeed given us much comfort respecting our young friend, but
considerable uneasiness respecting your own health and spirits, which
must have suffered under such attention. Pray believe me that we shall
wait in quiet hope for the time when I shall receive the welcome summons
to come and relieve you from a charge, which you have executed with such
tenderness. We desire nothing so much as to exchange it with you.
Nothing shall be wanting on my part to remove her with the best judgment
I can, without (I hope) any necessity for depriving you of the services
of your valuable housekeeper. Until the day comes, we entreat that you
will spare yourself the trouble of writing, which we should be ashamed
to impose upon you in your present weak state. Not hearing from you, we
shall be satisfied in believing that there has been no relapse.
Therefore we beg that you will not add to your troubles by unnecessary,
though <emphasis>most kind</emphasis>, correspondence. Till I have the pleasure of thanking
you personally, I beg you to accept these written acknowledgments of all
your kindness. With respects to Mr. Williams and sincere prayers for
both your healths, I remain,</p>

"Lucius Sergius," "Bluff," "Broad-Cloth,"

druggets and long camblets. And without this pre-engagement, I feel I
should naturally have chosen a side opposite to ——, for in the silken
seemingness of his nature there is that which offends me. My flesh
tingles at such caterpillars. He shall not crawl me over. Let him and
his workmen sing the old burthen,</p>
<p>            "Heigh ho, ye weavers!"</p>
<p>for any aid I shall offer them in this emergency. I was over Saint
Luke's the other day with my friend Tuthill, and mightily pleased with
one of his contrivances for the comfort and amelioration of the
students. They have double cells, in which a pair may lie feet to feet
horizontally, and chat the time away as rationally as they can. It must
certainly be more sociable for them these warm raving nights. The
right-hand truckle in one of these friendly recesses, at present vacant,
was preparing, I understood, for Mr. Irving. Poor fellow! it is time he
removed from Pentonville. I followed him as far as to Highbury the other
day, with a mob at his heels, calling out upon Ermigiddon, who I suppose
is some Scotch moderator. He squinted out his favourite eye last Friday,
in the fury of possession, upon a poor woman's shoulders that was crying
matches, and has not missed it. The companion truck, as far as I could
measure it with my eye, would conveniently fit a person about the length
of Coleridge, allowing for a reasonable drawing up of the feet, not at
all painful. Does he talk of moving this quarter? You and I have too
much sense to trouble ourselves with revelations; marry, to the same in
Greek you may have something professionally to say. Tell C. that he was
to come and see us some fine day. Let it be before he moves, for in his
new quarters he will necessarily be confined in his conversation to his
brother prophet. Conceive the two Rabbis foot to foot, for there are no
Gamaliels there to affect a humbler posture! All are masters in that
Patmos, where the law is perfect equality—Latmos, I should rather say,
for they will be Luna's twin darlings; her affection will be ever at the
full. Well; keep <emphasis>your</emphasis> brains moist with gooseberry this mad March, for
the devil of exposition seeketh dry places.</p>

<p>    "In lately going over the pages of <emphasis>The New Monthly Magazine</emphasis> for

    to Mr. Lamb junior for his exertions to relieve the weavers of
    Norwich.'…</p>
<p>    "As his 'Reminiscences of Juke Judkins, Esq.,' was printed in the
    same number of the <emphasis>Magazine</emphasis>, Lamb's attention would no doubt be
    arrested by the remarks about his namesake, which would probably be
    retained in his memory, to be used subsequently, as occasion served,
    in mystifying his friend."</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM AYRTON</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Westwood's, Chase Side, Enfield,</p>
<p>14th March, 1830.</p>
<p>My dear Ayrton,—Your letter, which was only not so pleasant as your
appearance would have been, has revived some old images; Phillips (not
the Colonel), with his few hairs bristling up at the charge of a revoke,
which he declares impossible; the old Captain's significant nod over the
right shoulder (was it not?); Mrs. Burney's determined questioning of
the score, after the game was absolutely gone to the devil, the plain
but hospitable cold boiled-beef suppers at sideboard; all which fancies,
redolent of middle age and strengthful spirits, come across us ever and
anon in this vale of deliberate senectitude, ycleped Enfield.</p>
<p>You imagine a deep gulf between you and us; and there is a pitiable
hiatus in <emphasis>kind</emphasis> between St. James's Park and this extremity of
Middlesex. But the mere distance in turnpike roads is a trifle. The roof
of a coach swings you down in an hour or two. We have a sure hot joint
on a Sunday, and when had we better? I suppose you know that ill health
has obliged us to give up housekeeping; but we have an asylum at the
very next door—only twenty-four inches further from town, which is not
material in a country expedition—where a <emphasis>table d'hôte</emphasis> is kept for us,
without trouble on our parts, and we adjourn after dinner, when one of
the old world (old friends) drops casually down among us. Come and find
us out, and seal our judicious change with your approbation, whenever
the whim bites, or the sun prompts. No need of announcement, for we are
sure to be at home.</p>
<p>I keep putting off the subject of my answer. In truth I am not in
spirits at present to see Mr. Murray on such a business; but pray offer
him my acknowledgments and an assurance that I should like at least one
of his propositions, as I have so much additional matter for the
SPECIMENS, as might make two volumes in all, or ONE (new edition)
omitting such better known authors as Beaumont and Fletcher, Jonson, &amp;c.</p>
<p>But we are both in trouble at present. A very dear young friend of ours,
who passed her Christmas holidays here, has been taken dangerously ill
with a fever, from which she is very precariously recovering, and I
expect a summons to fetch her when she is well enough to bear the
journey from Bury. It is Emma Isola, with whom we got acquainted at our
first visit to your sister at Cambridge, and she has been an occasional
inmate with us—and of late years much more frequently—ever since.
While she is in this danger, and till she is out of it and here in a
probable way to recovery, I feel that I have no spirits for an
engagement of any kind. It has been a terrible shock to us; therefore I
beg that you will make my handsomest excuses to Mr. Murray.</p>
<p>Our very kindest loves to Mrs. A. and the younger A.'s.</p>

<p>LETTER 507</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. WILLIAMS</strong></p>
<p>[Dated at end: March 22 (1830).]</p>
<p>Dear Madam,—Once more I have to return you thanks for a very kind
letter. It has gladdened us very much to hear that we may have hope to
see our young friend so soon, and through your kind nursing so well
recovered. I sincerely hope that your own health and spirits will not
have been shaken: you have had a sore trial indeed, and greatly do we
feel indebted to you for all which you have undergone. If I hear nothing
from you in the mean time, I shall secure myself a place in the
Cornwallis Coach for Monday. It will not be at all necessary that I
shall be met at Bury, as I can well find my way to the Rectory, and I
beg that you will not inconvenience yourselves by such attention.
Accordingly as I find Miss Isola able to bear the journey, I intend to
take the care of her by the same stage or by chaises perhaps, dividing
the journey; but exactly as you shall judge fit. It is our misfortune
that long journeys do not agree with my sister, who would else have
taken this care upon herself, perhaps more properly. It is quite out of
the question to rob you of the services of any of your domestics. I
cannot think of it. But if in your opinion a female attendant would be
requisite on the journey, and if you or Mr. Williams would feel <emphasis>more
comfortable</emphasis> by her being in charge of two, I will most gladly engage
one of her nurses or any young person near you, that you can recommend;
for my object is to remove her in the way that shall be most
satisfactory to yourselves.</p>
<p>On the subject of the young people that you are interesting yourselves
about, I will have the pleasure to talk to you, when I shall see you. I
live almost out of the world and out of the sphere of being useful; but
no pains of mine shall be spared, if but a prospect opens of doing a
service. Could I do all I wish, and I indeed have grown helpless to
myself and others, it must not satisfy the arrears of obligation I owe
to Mr. Williams and yourself for all your kindness.</p>
<p>I beg you will turn in your mind and consider in what most comfortable
way Miss Isola can leave your house, and I will implicitly follow your
suggestions. What you have done for her can never be effaced from our
memories, and I would have you part with her in the way that would best
satisfy yourselves.</p>
<p>I am afraid of impertinently extending my letter, else I feel I have not
said half what I would say. So, dear madam, till I have the pleasure of
seeing you both, of whose kindness I have heard so much before, I
respectfully take my leave with our kindest love to your poor patient
and most sincere regards for the health and happiness of Mr. Williams
and yourself.</p>
<p>May God bless you.                                          CH. LAMB.</p>

<p>LETTER 508</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. WILLIAMS</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, 2 Apr., 1830.</p>
<p>Dear Madam</p>
<p>I have great pleasure in letting you know that Miss Isola has suffered
very little from fatigue on her long journey. I am ashamed to say that I
came home rather the more tired of the two. But I am a very unpractised
traveller. She has had two tolerable nights' sleeps since, and is
decidedly not worse than when we left you. I remembered the Magnesia
according to your directions, and promise that she shall be kept very
quiet, never forgetting that she is still an invalid. We found my Sister
very well in health, only a little impatient to see her; and, after a
few hysterical tears for gladness, all was comfortable again. We arrived
here from Epping between five and six. The incidents of our journey were
trifling, but you bade me tell them. We had then in the coach a rather
talkative Gentleman, but very civil, all the way, and took up a servant
maid at Stamford, going to a sick mistress. To the <emphasis>latter</emphasis>, a
participation in the hospitalities of your nice rusks and sandwiches
proved agreeable, as it did to my companion, who took merely a sip of
the weakest wine and water with them. The <emphasis>former</emphasis> engaged me in a
discourse for full twenty miles on the probable advantages of Steam
Carriages, which being merely problematical, I bore my part in with some
credit, in spite of my totally un-engineer-like faculties. But when
somewhere about Stanstead he put an unfortunate question to me as to the
"probability of its turning out a good turnip season;" and when I, who
am still less of an agriculturist than a steam-philosopher, not knowing
a turnip from a potato ground, innocently made answer that I believed it
depended very much upon boiled legs of mutton, my unlucky reply set Miss
Isola a laughing to a degree that disturbed her tranquility for the only
moment in our journey. I am afraid my credit sank very low with my other
fellow-traveller, who had thought he had met with a <emphasis>well-informed
passenger</emphasis>, which is an accident so desirable in a Stage Coach. We were
rather less communicative, but still friendly, the rest of the way. How
I employed myself between Epping and Enfield the poor verses in the
front of my paper may inform you which you may please to Christen an
Acrostic in a Cross Road, and which I wish were worthier of the Lady
they refer to. But I trust you will plead my pardon to her on a subject
so delicate as a Lady's good <emphasis>name</emphasis>. Your candour must acknowledge that
they are written <emphasis>strait</emphasis>. And now dear Madam, I have left myself hardly
space to express my sense of the friendly reception I found at Fornham.
Mr. Williams will tell you that we had the pleasure of a slight meeting
with him on the road, where I could almost have told him, but that it
seemed ungracious, that such had been your hospitality, that I scarcely
missed the good Master of the Family at Fornham, though heartily I
should [have] rejoiced to have made a little longer acquaintance with
him. I will say nothing of our deeper obligations to both of you,
because I think we agreed at Fornham, that gratitude may be over-exacted
on the part of the obliging, and over-expressed on the part of the
obliged, person. My Sister and Miss Isola join in respects to Mr.
Williams and yourself, and I beg to be remembered kindly to the Miss
Hammonds and the two gentlemen whom I had the good fortune to meet at
your house. I have not forgotten the Election in which you are
interesting yourself, and the little that I can, I will do immediately.
Miss Isola will have the pleasure of writing to you next week, and we
shall hope, at your leisure, to hear of your own health, etc. I am, Dear
Madam, with great respect,</p>
<p>your obliged</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>[<emphasis>Added in Miss Isola's hand:</emphasis>] I must just add a line to beg you will
let us hear from you, my dear Mrs. Williams. I have just received the
forwarded letter. Fornham we have talked about constantly, and I felt
quite strange at this home the first day. I will attend to all you said,
my dear Madam.</p>

<p>LETTER 509</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. WILLIAMS</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, Good Friday [April 9, 1830].</p>
<p>P.S.—I am the worst folder-up of a letter in the world, except certain
Hottentots, in the land of Caffre, who never fold up their letters at
all, writing very badly upon skins, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Dear Madam,—I do assure you that your verses gratified me very much,
and my sister is quite <emphasis>proud</emphasis> of them. For the first time in my life I
congratulated myself upon the shortness and meanness of my name. Had it
been Schwartzenberg or Esterhazy, it would have put you to some puzzle.
I am afraid I shall sicken you of acrostics; but this last was written
<emphasis>to order</emphasis>. I beg you to have inserted in your county paper something
like this advertisement. "To the nobility, gentry, and others, about
Bury.—C. Lamb respectfully informs his friends and the public in
general, that he is leaving off business in the acrostic line, as he is
going into an entirely new line. Rebuses and charades done as usual, and
upon the old terms. Also, Epitaphs to suit the memory of any person
deceased." I thought I had adroitly escaped the rather unpliable name of
"Williams," curtailing your poor daughters to their proper surnames; but
it seems you would not let me off so easily. If these trifles amuse you,
I am paid. Tho really 'tis an operation too much like—"A, apple-pye; B,
bit it." To make amends, I request leave to lend you the "Excursion,"
and to recommend, in particular, the "Churchyard Stories," in the
seventh book, I think. They will strengthen the tone of your mind after
its weak diet on acrostics. Miss Isola is writing, and will tell you
that we are going on very comfortably. Her sister is just come. She
blames my last verses, as being more written on <emphasis>Mr.</emphasis> Williams than on
yourself; but how should I have parted whom a Superior Power has brought
together? I beg you will jointly accept of our best respects, and pardon
your obsequious if not troublesome Correspondent, C.L.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Mr. Cecil Turner, a grandson of Mrs. Williams, tells me that her
acrostic on Lamb ran thus:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TO CHARLES LAMB</strong></p>
<p>      <emphasis>Answer to Acrostics on the Names of Two Friends</emphasis></p>

<empty-line/>

      Ranged in thy verse two friends most dear.</p>

<p>

      Lay not thy winning pen away,</p>
<empty-line/>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JACOB VALE ASBURY</strong></p>
<p>[? April, 1830.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir—Some draughts and boluses have been brought here which we
conjecture were meant for the young lady whom you saw this morning,
though they are labelled for</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MISS ISOLA LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>No such person is known on the Chase Side, and she is fearful of taking
medicines which may have been made up for another patient. She begs me
to say that she was born an <emphasis>Isola</emphasis> and christened <emphasis>Emma</emphasis>. Moreover that
she is Italian by birth, and that her ancestors were from Isola Bella
(Fair Island) in the kingdom of Naples. She has never changed her name
and rather mournfully adds that she has no prospect at present of doing
so. She is literally I. SOLA, or single, at present. Therefore she begs
that the obnoxious monosyllable may be omitted on future Phials,—an
innocent syllable enough, you'll say, but she has no claim to it. It is
the bitterest pill of the seven you have sent her. When a lady loses her
good <emphasis>name</emphasis>, what is to become of her? Well she must swallow it as well
as she can, but begs the dose may not be repeated.</p>
<p>Yours faithfully,</p>
<p>CHARLES LAMB (not Isola).</p>

<p>[Asbury was a doctor at Enfield. I append another letter to him, without

<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>LETTER 512</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO JACOB VALE ASBURY</strong></p>
<p>Dear Sir, It is an observation of a wise man that "moderation is best in
all things." I cannot agree with him "in liquor." There is a smoothness
and oiliness in wine that makes it go down by a natural channel, which I
am positive was made for that descending. Else, why does not wine choke
us? could Nature have made that sloping lane, not to facilitate the
down-going? She does nothing in vain. You know that better than I. You
know how often she has helped you at a dead lift, and how much better
entitled she is to a fee than yourself sometimes, when you carry off the
credit. Still there is something due to manners and customs, and I
should apologise to you and Mrs. Asbury for being absolutely carried
home upon a man's shoulders thro' Silver Street, up Parson's Lane, by
the Chapels (which might have taught me better), and then to be
deposited like a dead log at Gaffar Westwood's, who it seems does not
"insure" against intoxication. Not that the mode of conveyance is
objectionable. On the contrary, it is more easy than a one-horse chaise.
Ariel in the "Tempest" says</p>
<p>               "On a Bat's back do I fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               After sunset merrily."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now I take it that Ariel must sometimes have stayed out late of nights.
Indeed, he pretends that "where the bee sucks, there lurks he," as much
as to say that his suction is as innocent as that little innocent (but
damnably stinging when he is provok'd) winged creature. But I take it,
that Ariel was fond of metheglin, of which the Bees are notorious
Brewers. But then you will say: What a shocking sight to see a
middle-aged gentleman-and-a-half riding upon a Gentleman's back up
Parson's Lane at midnight. Exactly the time for that sort of conveyance,
when nobody can see him, nobody but Heaven and his own conscience; now
Heaven makes fools, and don't expect much from her own creation; and as
for conscience, She and I have long since come to a compromise. I have
given up false modesty, and she allows me to abate a little of the true.
I like to be liked, but I don't care about being respected. I don't
respect myself. But, as I was saying, I thought he would have let me
down just as we got to Lieutenant Barker's Coal-shed (or emporium) but
by a cunning jerk I eased myself, and righted my posture. I protest, I
thought myself in a palanquin, and never felt myself so grandly carried.
It was a slave under me. There was I, all but my reason. And what is
reason? and what is the loss of it? and how often in a day do we do
without it, just as well? Reason is only counting, two and two makes
four. And if on my passage home, I thought it made five, what matter?
Two and two will just make four, as it always did, before I took the
finishing glass that did my business. My sister has begged me to write
an apology to Mrs. A. and you for disgracing your party; now it does
seem to me, that I rather honoured your party, for every one that was
not drunk (and one or two of the ladies, I am sure, were not) must have
been set off greatly in the contrast to me. I was the scapegoat. The
soberer they seemed. By the way is magnesia good on these occasions?
<emphasis>iii</emphasis> pol: med: sum: ante noct: in rub: can:. I am no licentiate, but
know enough of simples to beg you to send me a draught after this model.
But still you'll say (or the men and maids at your house will say) that
it is not a seemly sight for an old gentleman to go home pick-a-back.
Well, may be it is not. But I have never studied grace. I take it to be
a mere superficial accomplishment. I regard more the internal
acquisitions. The great object after supper is to get home, and whether
that is obtained in a horizontal posture or perpendicular (as foolish
men and apes affect for dignity) I think is little to the purpose. The
end is always greater than the means. Here I am, able to compose a
sensible rational apology, and what signifies how I got here? I have
just sense enough to remember I was very happy last night, and to thank
our kind host and hostess, and that's sense enough, I hope.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>N.B.—What is good for a desperate head-ache? Why, Patience, and a
determination not to mind being miserable all day long. And that I have
made my mind up to.</p>

have been, had your man toppled me down at Lieut. Barker's Coal-shed. My

<p>["Ariel." In two other of his letters, Lamb confesses similarly to a
similar escapade. And in his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "Rejoicings on the New Year's
Coming of Age," he sends Ash Wednesday home in the same manner.</p>
<p>Lieut. John Barker, R.N., was a local character, a coal merchant and a
man with a grievance. He had thirteen children, some of whose names
probably greatly amused Lamb—John Thomas, William Charles, Frederick
Alexander, Marius Collins, Caius Marcius, Marcus Aurelius Antonius,
Coriolanus Aurelius, Horatius Tertius Decimus, Elizabeth Mary,
Concordia, Lousia Clarissa, Caroline Maria Quiroja and Volumnia
Hortensia.]</p>

<p>LETTER 513</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MRS. WILLIAMS</strong></p>
<p>Enfield, Tuesday [April 21, 1830].</p>
<p>Dear Madam,—I have ventured upon some lines, which combine my old
acrostic talent (which you first found out) with my new profession of
epitaph-monger. As you did not please to say, when you would die, I have
left a blank space for the date. May kind heaven be a long time in
filling it up. At least you cannot say that these lines are not about
you, though not much to the purpose. We were very sorry to hear that you
have not been very well, and hope that a little excursion may revive
you. Miss Isola is thankful for her added day; but I verily think she
longs to see her young friends once more, and will regret less than ever
the end of her holydays. She cannot be going on more quietly than she is
doing here, and you will perceive amendment.</p>
<p>I hope all her little commissions will all be brought home to your
satisfaction. When she returns, we purpose seeing her to Epping on her
journey. We have had our proportion of fine weather and some pleasant
walks, and she is stronger, her appetite good, but less wolfish than at
first, which we hold a good sign. I hope Mr. Wing will approve of its
abatement. She desires her very kindest respects to Mr. Williams and
yourself, and wishes to rejoin you. My sister and myself join in
respect, and pray tell Mr. Donne, with our compliments, that we shall be
disappointed, if we do not see him. This letter being very neatly
written, I am very unwilling that Emma should club any of her
disproportionate scrawl to deface it.</p>
<p>Your obliged servant,</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

<p>Here should come an undated note from Lamb to Basil Montagu, in which
Lamb asks for help for Hone in his Coffee-House. "If you can help a
worthy man you will have <emphasis>two worthy men</emphasis> obliged to you." Hone, having
fallen upon bad times, Lamb helped in the scheme to establish him in the
Grasshopper Coffee-House, at 13 Gracechurch Street (see next letter).]</p>

<p>LETTER 514</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO ROBERT SOUTHEY</strong></p>
<p>May 10, 1830.</p>
<p>Dear Southey,—My friend Hone, whom you would like <emphasis>for a friend</emphasis>, I
found deeply impressed with your generous notice of him in your
beautiful "Life of Bunyan," which I am just now full of. He has written
to you for leave to publish a certain good-natured letter. I write not
this to enforce his request, for we are fully aware that the refusal of
such publication would be quite consistent with all that is good in your
character. Neither he nor I expect it from you, nor exact it; but if you
would consent to it, you would have me obliged by it, as well as him. He
is just now in a critical situation: kind friends have opened a
coffee-house for him in the City, but their means have not extended to
the purchase of coffee-pots, credit for Reviews, newspapers, and other
paraphernalia. So I am sitting in the skeleton of a possible divan. What
right I have to interfere, you best know. Look on me as a dog who went
once temporarily insane, and bit you, and now begs for a crust. Will you
set your wits to a dog?</p>
<p>Our object is to open a subscription, which my friends of the "Times"
are most willing to forward for him, but think that a leave from you to
publish would aid it.</p>
<p>But not an atom of respect or kindness will or shall it abate in either
of us if you decline it. Have this strongly in your mind.</p>
<p>Those "Every-Day" and "Table" Books will be a treasure a hundred years
hence; but they have failed to make Hone's fortune.</p>
<p>Here his wife and all his children are about me, gaping for coffee
customers; but how should they come in, seeing no pot boiling!</p>
<p>Enough of Hone. I saw Coleridge a day or two since. He has had some
severe attack, not paralytic; but, if I had not heard of it, I should
not have found it out. He looks, and especially speaks, strong. How are
all the Wordsworths and all the Southeys? whom I am obliged to you if
you have not brought up haters of the name of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>P.S.—I have gone lately into the acrostic line. I find genius (such as
I had) declines with me, but I get clever. Do you know anybody that
wants charades, or such things, for Albums? I do 'em at so much a sheet.
Perhaps an epigram (not a very happy-gram) I did for a school-boy
yesterday may amuse. I pray Jove he may not get a flogging for any false
quantity; but 'tis, with one exception, the only Latin verses I have
made for forty years, and I did it "to order."</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>[Major's edition of <emphasis>The Pilgrim's Progress</emphasis>, mentioned in a letter to
Barton above, was issued in 1830 with a memoir of Bunyan by Southey. It
was reviewed in <emphasis>The Times</emphasis> for May 7, 1830, I think probably by Lamb,
in the following terms:—</p>
<p>    The public is aware that the unexhausted diligence and unwearied pen
    of Mr. Southey have produced a new and excellent edition of the
    celebrated <emphasis>Pilgrim's Progress</emphasis>, with the Life of the Author
    prefixed. This Life is, no doubt, an interesting work, though we
    wish the author, both in that and in the account, which is
    attributed to him, of the founder of the Jesuits, contained in a
    recent periodical work, had taken more time. The narrative in both
    is hasty and tumultuary, if we may use the latter expression: there
    is no time or room for reflection; and when a reflection comes, it
    is so mixed and jambed in with the story, or with quotations from
    the works or words of the respective heroes of the history, that it
    escapes unobserved. Could we, without grievous offence, recommend,
    both to Mr. Southey and Sir Walter Scott, to recollect the man
    spoken of by Horace?—</p>
<p>quem fama est esse librisque Ambustum propriis."—<emphasis>Sat</emphasis>, i., 61.</p>
<p>    Yet still, as we said above, the Life of Bunyan is an interesting
    work. How different the origin of all the sects and their founders,
    from that of our sober, staid, and, we trust, permanent
    establishment, and the learned and pious reformers from whom it
    sprang!</p>
<p>    But that for which we chiefly notice this work of Mr. Southey, is
    the very last sentence in it, wherein is contained his frank and
    honourable recommendation (though not more than they deserve) of the
    works of one whom the iron hand of oppression would have levelled
    with the dust:—</p>
<p>    "In one of the volumes collected from various quarters, which were
    sent to me for this purpose, I observe the name of W. Hone, and
    notice it that I may take the opportunity of recommending his
    <emphasis>Every-Day Book</emphasis> and <emphasis>Table Book</emphasis> to those who are interested in the
    preservation of our national and local customs. By these very
    curious publications their compiler has rendered good service in an
    important department of literature; and he may render yet more, if
    he obtain the encouragement which he well deserves."</p>
<p>    Not only we, and the person mentioned in this paragraph, but all the
    friends of pure English literature,—all the curious in old English
    customs,—in short, all intelligent men, with the hearts of
    Englishmen in them,—owe Mr. Southey their gratitude for this
    recommendation: it springs from a just taste and right feeling
    united.</p>
<p>Hone wrote to <emphasis>The Times</emphasis> at once to thank both the paper and Southey
for the compliment. A few days later, on May 21, appeared an article in
<emphasis>The Times</emphasis> containing correspondence between Hone and Southey. I quote
the introduction, again probably the work of Lamb, and Southey's letter
(see Lamb's letter to Hone below):—</p>
<p>    We alluded some days ago to the handsome notice of Mr. Hone in Mr.
    Southey's <emphasis>Life of Bunyan</emphasis>. The following correspondence has since
    been sent to us: it displays in an advantageous light the modesty of
    Mr. Hone and the amiable and candid disposition of Mr. Southey. The
    business, wholly foreign to Mr. Hone's former pursuits, which is
    alluded to in the letter, is explained in an advertisement in this
    day's paper.</p>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
<p>    "To Mr. Hone, 13, Gracechurch-Street,</p>
<p>    "Keswick, April 26.</p>
<p>    "Sir,—Your letter has given me both pain and pleasure. I am sorry
    to learn that you are still, in the worldly sense of the word, an
    unfortunate man,—that you are withdrawn from pursuits which were
    consonant to your habits and inclinations, and that a public
    expression of respect and good-will, made in the hope that it might
    have been serviceable to you, can have no such effect.</p>
<p>    "When I observed your autograph in the little book, I wrote to
    inquire of Mr. Major whether it had come to his hands from you,
    directly or indirectly, for my use, that, in that case, I might
    thank you for it. It proved otherwise, but I would not lose an
    opportunity which I had wished for.</p>
<p>    "Judging of you (as I would myself be judged) by your works, I saw
    in the editor of the <emphasis>Every-Day</emphasis> and <emphasis>Table Books</emphasis> a man who had
    applied himself with great diligence to useful and meritorious
    pursuits. I thought that time, and reflection, and affliction, (of
    which it was there seen that he had had his share,) had contributed
    to lead him into this direction, which was also that of his better
    mind. What alteration had been produced in his opinions it concerned
    not me to inquire; here there were none but what were
    unexceptionable,—no feelings but what were to be approved. From all
    that appeared, I supposed he had become 'a sadder and a wiser man:'
    I therefore wished him success in his literary undertakings.</p>
<p>    "The little parcel which you mention I shall receive with pleasure.</p>
<p>    "I wish you success in your present undertaking, whatever it be, and
    that you may one day, under happier circumstances, resume a pen
    which has, of late years, been so meritoriously employed. If your
    new attempt prosper, you will yet find leisure for intellectual
    gratification, and for that self-improvement which may be carried on
    even in the busiest concerns of life.</p>
<p>    "I remain, Sir, yours with sincere good will,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    "ROBERT SOUTHEY."</strong></p>
<p>In the advertisement columns of the same issue of <emphasis>The Times</emphasis> (May 21)
was the following notice, drawn up, I assume, by Lamb:—</p>
<p>    THE FAMILY OF WILLIAM HONE, in the course of last winter, were
    kindly assisted by private friends to take and alter the premises
    they now reside in, No. 13, Gracechurch-street, for the purpose of a
    coffeehouse, to be managed by Mrs. Hone and her elder daughters; but
    they are in a painful exigency which increases hourly, and renders a
    public appeal indispensable. The wellwishers to Mr. Hone throughout
    the kingdom, especially the gratified readers of his literary
    productions (in all of which he has long ceased to have an interest,
    and from none of which can he derive advantage), are earnestly
    solicited to afford the means of completing the fittings and opening
    the house in a manner suited to its proposed respectability. If this
    aid be yielded without loss of time, it will be of indescribable
    benefit, inasmuch as it will put an end to many grievous anxieties
    and expenses, inseparable from the lengthened delay which has
    hitherto been inevitable, and will enable the family to immediately
    commence the business, which alone they look forward to for support.
    Subscriptions will be received by the following bankers:—Messrs.
    Ransom and Co., Pall-mall east; Messrs. Dixon, Sons, and Brookes,
    Chancery-lane; Messrs. Ladbroke and Co., Bank-buildings, Cornhill;
    and by Mr. Clowes, printer, 14, Charing-cross; Mr. Thomas Rodd,
    bookseller, 2, Great Newport-street; Mr. Griffiths, bookseller, 13,
    Wellington-street, Strand; Mr. Effingham Wilson, bookseller, Royal
    Exchange; and Messrs. Fisher and Moxhay, biscuit-bakers, 55,
    Threadneedle-street.</p>
<p>The first list of subscriptions, headed by "Charles Lamb, Esq., Enfield,
£10," came to £103. This was Monday, May 31. The next list was published
on June 10, accompanied by the following note in the body of the
paper:—</p>
<p>    The subscriptions for Mr. Hone, it will be perceived, are going on
    favourably. In the list now published is the name of the Duke of
    Bedford, who has sent 20_l_. His cause has been warmly espoused by
    the provincial journals, more than 20 of which have inserted his
    appeal gratuitously, with offers to receive and remit subscriptions.
    The aphorism, "he gives twice who gives quickly," could not receive
    a more cogent application than in the present instance, for the
    funds are required to enable Mr. Hone to commence business in his
    new undertaking, where he is already placed with his family, liable
    to rent and taxes, and other claims, but gaining nothing until his
    outfit is completed.</p>
<p>    Hone, however, did not prosper, in spite of his friends, who were
    not sufficiently numerous to find the requisite capital.</p>
<p>    "Suum Cuique." The boy for whom this epigram was composed was a son
    of Hessey, the publisher, afterwards Archdeacon Hessey. He was at
    the Merchant Taylors' School, where it was a custom to compose Latin
    and English epigrams for speech day, the boys being permitted to get
    help. Archdeacon Hessey wrote as follows in the Taylorian a few
    years ago:—</p>
<p>    The subjects for 1830 were <emphasis>Suum Cuique</emphasis> and <emphasis>Brevis esse laboro</emphasis>.
    After some three or four exercise nights I confess that I was
    literally "at my wits' end." But a brilliant idea struck me. I had
    frequently, boy as I was, seen Charles Lamb at my father's house,
    and once, in 1825 or 1826, I had been taken to have tea with him and
    his sister, Mary Lamb, at their little house, Colebrook Cottage, a
    whitish-brown tenement, standing by itself, close to the New River,
    at Islington. He was very kind, as he always was to young people,
    and very quaint. I told him that I had devoured his "Roast Pig"; he
    congratulated me on possessing a thorough schoolboy's appetite. And
    he was pleased when I mentioned my having seen the boys at Christ's
    Hospital at their public suppers, which then took place on the
    Sunday evenings in Lent. "Could this good-natured and humorous old
    gentleman be prevailed upon to give me an Epigram?" "I don't know,"
    said my father, to whom I put the question, "but I will ask him at
    any rate, and send him the mottoes." In a day or two there arrived
    from Enfield, to which Lamb had removed some time in 1827, not one,
    but two epigrams, one on each subject. That on <emphasis>Suum Cuique</emphasis> was in
    Latin, and was suggested by the grim satisfaction which had recently
    been expressed by the public at the capture and execution of some
    notorious highwayman.</p>
<p>See also Vol. IV. of this edition for a slightly differing version. Lamb
had many years before, he says in a letter to Godwin, written similar
epigrams.</p>
<p>"With one exception." Perhaps the Latin verses on Haydon's picture. See</p>

us on Wednesday. That it may be a long one, cannot you secure places now
for Mrs. Novello yourself and the Clarkes? We have just table room for
four. Five make my good Landlady fidgetty; six, to begin to fret; seven,
to approximate to fever point. But seriously we shall prefer four to two
or three; we shall have from 1/2 past 10 to six, when the coach goes

<p>Dear N.—pray write immediately to say "The book has come safe." I am
anxious, not so much for the autographs, as for that bit of the hair
brush. I enclose a cinder, which belonged to <emphasis>Shield</emphasis>, when he was poor,
and lit his own fires. Any memorial of a great Musical Genius, I know,
is acceptable; and Shield has his merits, though Clementi, in my
opinion, is far above him in the Sostenuto. Mr. Westwood desires his
compliments, and begs to present you with a nail that came out of
Jomelli's coffin, who is buried at Naples.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Vincent Novello writes on this: "A very characteristic note from Dear
Charles Lamb, who always pretended to Rate all kinds of memorials and
<emphasis>Relics</emphasis>, and assumed a look of fright and horror whenever he reproached
me with being a <emphasis>Papist</emphasis>, instead of a <emphasis>Quaker</emphasis>, which sect he pretended
to doat upon." The book would be Novello's album, with Lamb's "Free
Thoughts on Eminent Composers" in it (see next letter but one).</p>
<p>Shield was William Shield (1748-1829), the composer. He was buried in
Westminster Abbey in the same grave as Clementi. Nicolo Jomelli

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SARAH HAZLITT</strong></p>
<p>[Enfield, Saturday, May 24th, 1830.]</p>
<p>Mary's love? Yes. Mary Lamb quite well.</p>
<p>Dear Sarah,—I found my way to Northaw on Thursday and a very good woman
behind a counter, who says also that you are a very good lady but that
the woman who was with you was naught. These things may be so or not. I
did not accept her offered glass of wine (home-made, I take it) but
craved a cup of ale, with which I seasoned a slice of cold Lamb from a
sandwich box, which I ate in her back parlour, and proceeded for
Berkhampstead, &amp;c.; lost myself over a heath, and had a day's pleasure.
I wish you could walk as I do, and as you used to do. I am sorry to find
you are so poorly; and, now I have found my way, I wish you back at
Goody Tomlinson's. What a pretty village 'tis! I should have come
sooner, but was waiting a summons to Bury. Well, it came, and I found
the good parson's lady (he was from home) exceedingly hospitable.</p>
<p>Poor Emma, the first moment we were alone, took me into a corner, and
said, "Now, pray, don't <emphasis>drink</emphasis>; do check yourself after dinner, for my
sake, and when we get home to Enfield, you shall drink as much as ever
you please, and I won't say a word about it." How I behaved, you may
guess, when I tell you that Mrs. Williams and I have written acrostics
on each other, and she hoped that she should have "no reason to regret
Miss Isola's recovery, by its depriving <emphasis>her</emphasis> of our begun
correspondence." Emma stayed a month with us, and has gone back (in
tolerable health) to her long home, for <emphasis>she</emphasis> comes not again for a
twelvemonth. I amused Mrs. Williams with an occurrence on our road to
Enfield. We travelled with one of those troublesome fellow-passengers in
a stage-coach, that is called a well-informed man. For twenty miles we
discoursed about the properties of steam, probabilities of carriages by
ditto, till all my science, and more than all, was exhausted, and I was
thinking of escaping my torment by getting up on the outside, when,
getting into Bishops Stortford, my gentleman, spying some farming land,
put an unlucky question to me: "What sort of a crop of turnips I thought
we should have this year?" Emma's eyes turned to me, to know what in the
world I could have to say; and she burst into a violent fit of laughter,
maugre her pale, serious cheeks, when, with the greatest gravity, I
replied, that "it depended, I believed, upon boiled legs of mutton."
This clench'd our conversation; and my Gentleman, with a face half wise,
half in scorn, troubled us with no more conversation, scientific or
philosophical, for the remainder of the journey. Ayrton was here
yesterday, and as <emphasis>learned</emphasis> to the full as my fellow-traveller. What a
pity that he will spoil a wit and a devilish pleasant fellow (as he is)
by wisdom! He talk'd on Music; and by having read Hawkins and Burney
recently I was enabled to talk of Names, and show more knowledge than he
had suspected I possessed; and in the end he begg'd me to shape my
thoughts upon paper, which I did after he was gone, and sent him.</p>

<p>Martin Burney is as odd as ever. We had a dispute about the word "heir,"
which I contended was pronounced like "air;" he said that might be in
common parlance; or that we might so use it, speaking of the
"Heir-at-Law," a comedy; but that in the Law Courts it was necessary to
give it a full aspiration, and to say <emphasis>Hayer</emphasis>; he thought it might even
vitiate a cause, if a Counsel pronounced it otherwise. In conclusion, he
"would consult Serjeant Wilde;" who gave it against him. Sometimes he
falleth into the water, sometimes into the fire. He came down here, and
insisted on reading Virgil's "Eneid" all through with me (which he did,)
because a Counsel must know Latin. Another time he read out all the
Gospel of St. John, because Biblical quotations are very emphatic in a
Court of Justice. A third time, he would carve a fowl, which he did very
ill-favoredly, because "we did not know how indispensable it was for a
Barrister to do all those sort of things well. Those little things were
of more consequence than we supposed." So he goes on, harassing about
the way to prosperity, and losing it. With a long head, but somewhat a
wrong one—harum-scarum. Why does not his guardian angel look to him? He
deserves one—: may be, he has tired him out.</p>

<p>["Free Thoughts." The version in Ayrton's album differs a little from
this, the principal difference being in line 13, "primitive" for
"un-Spaniardised." Lamb's story of the origin of the verses is not
necessarily correct. I fancy that he had written them for Novello before
he produced them in reply to Ayrton's challenge. When sending the poem
to Ayrton in a letter at this time, not available for this edition
(written apparently just after Novello had paid the visit, referred to
above), Lamb wrote that it was written to gratify Novello.</p>
<p>Mary Lamb (or Charles Lamb, personating her) appended the following

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. June 28, 1830.]</p>
<p>DEAR B.B.—Could you dream of my publishing without sending a copy to
you? You will find something new to you in the vol. particularly the
Translations. Moxon will send to you the moment it is out. He is the
young poet of Xmas, whom the Author of the Pleasures of Memory has set
up in the bookvending business with a volunteer'd loan of £500—such
munificence is rare to an almost stranger. But Rogers, I am told, has
done many goodnatured things of this nature. I need not say how glad to
see A.K. and Lucy we should have been,—and still shall be, if it be
practicable. Our direction is Mr. Westwood's, Chase Side Enfield, but
alas I know not theirs. We can give them a bed. Coaches come daily from
the Bell, Holborn.</p>
<p>You will see that I am worn to the poetical dregs, condescending to
Acrostics, which are nine fathom beneath Album verses—but they were
written at the request of the Lady where our Emma is, to whom I paid a
visit in April to bring home Emma for a change of air after a severe
illness, in which she had been treated like a daughter by the good
Parson and his whole family. She has since return'd to her occupation. I
thought on you in Suffolk, but was 40 miles from Woodbridge. I heard of
you the other day from Mr. Pulham of the India House.</p>
<p>Long live King William the 4th.</p>
<p>S.T.C. says, we have had wicked kings, foolish kings, wise kings, good
kings (but few) but never till now have we had a Blackguard King—</p>
<p>Charles 2d was profligate, but a Gentleman.</p>
<p>I have nineteen Letters to dispatch this leisure Sabbath for Moxon to
send about with Copies-so you will forgive me short measure—and believe
me</p>
<p>Yours ever</p>

<p>[Lamb's <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis> was almost ready. The translations were those
from Vincent Bourne.</p>
<p>William IV. came to the throne on June 26, 1830.</p>
<p>"I have nineteen Letters." The fact that none of these is forthcoming
helps to illustrate the imperfect state of Lamb's correspondence as
(even among so many differing editions) we now have it. But of course
the number may have been an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Here should come a note from Lamb to Hone, dated July 1, 1830, in which
Lamb asks that the newspaper be kept as he is meditating a town
residence (see next letter).</p>
<p>Here probably should come an undated letter to Mrs. John Rickman,
accompanying a gift of <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis>. Lamb says: "Will you re-give, or
<emphasis>lend</emphasis> me, by the bearer, the one Volume of juvenile Poetry? I have
tidings of a second at Brighton." He proposes that he and Mrs. Rickman
shall some day play old whist for the two.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO BERNARD BARTON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. 30 August, 1830.]</p>
<p>Dear B.B.—my address is 34 Southampton Buildings, Holborn. For God's
sake do not let me [be] pester'd with Annuals. They are all rogues who
edit them, and something else who write in them. I am still alone, and
very much out of sorts, and cannot spur up my mind to writing. The sight
of one of those Year Books makes me sick. I get nothing by any of 'em,
not even a Copy—</p>
<p>Thank you for your warm interest about my little volume, for the critics
on which I care [? not] the 5 hundred thousandth part of the tythe of a
half-farthing. I am too old a Militant for that. How noble, tho', in
R.S. to come forward for an old friend, who had treated him so
unworthily. Moxon has a shop without customers, I a Book without
readers. But what a clamour against a poor collection of album verses,
as if we had put forth an Epic. I cannot scribble a long Letter—I am,
when not at foot, very desolate, and take no interest in any thing,
scarce hate any thing, but annuals. I am in an interregnum of thought
and feeling—</p>
<p>What a beautiful Autumn morning this is, if it was but with me as in
times past when the candle of the Lord shined round me—</p>
<p>I cannot even muster enthusiasm to admire the French heroism.</p>
<p>In better times I hope we may some day meet, and discuss an old poem or
two. But if you'd have me not sick no more of Annuals.</p>

had no hope of recovery in London. Her state of mind is deplorable
beyond any example. I almost fear whether she has strength at her time
of life ever to get out of it. Here she must be nursed, and neither see
nor hear of anything in the world out of her sick chamber. The mere
hearing that Southey had called at our lodgings totally upset her. Pray
see him, or hear of him at Mr. Rickman's, and excuse my not writing to
him. I dare not write or receive a letter in her presence; every little
task so agitates her. Westwood will receive any letter for me, and give
it me privately. Pray assure Southey of my kindliest feelings towards

<p>[I cannot say to what the opening sentences refer: probably an
advertisement for <emphasis>Satan in Search of a Wife</emphasis> ("the Devil"), which Lamb

<p>The reference to the Juvenile Poetry suggests that Moxon had procured
some of the sheets of the <emphasis>Poetry for Children</emphasis> which Godwin brought out
in 1809, and was binding up a few. This theory is borne out by the
statement in the letter to Mrs. Norris, later, that the book was not to
be had for love or money, and the circumstance that in 1833 Lamb seems
to send her a copy. Ryle was Charles Ryle. an India House clerk, and

best love. Poor Enfield, that has been so peaceable hitherto, has caught
the inflammatory fever, the tokens are upon her! and a great fire was
blazing last night in the barns and haystacks of a farmer, about half a
mile from us. Where will these things end? There is no doubt of its
being the work of some ill-disposed rustic; but how is he to be
discovered? They go to work in the dark with strange chemical
preparations unknown to our forefathers. There is not even a dark
lantern to have a chance of detecting these Guy Fauxes. We are past the
iron age, and are got into the fiery age, undream'd of by Ovid. You are
lucky in Clifford's Inn where, I think, you have few ricks or stacks
worth the burning. Pray keep as little corn by you as you can, for fear
of the worst.</p>
<p>It was never good times in England since the poor began to speculate
upon their condition. Formerly, they jogged on with as little reflection
as horses: the whistling ploughman went cheek by jowl with his brother
that neighed. Now the biped carries a box of phosphorus in his
leather-breeches; and in the dead of night the half-illuminated beast
steals his magic potion into a cleft in a barn, and half a country is
grinning with new fires. Farmer Graystock said something to the touchy
rustic that he did not relish, and he writes his distaste in flames.
What a power to intoxicate his crude brains, just muddlingly awake, to
perceive that something is wrong in the social system!-what a hellish
faculty above gunpowder!</p>
<p>Now the rich and poor are fairly pitted; we shall see who can hang or
burn fastest. It is not always revenge that stimulates these kindlings.
There is a love of exerting mischief. Think of a disrespected clod that
was trod into earth, that was nothing, on a sudden by damned arts
refined into an exterminating angel, devouring the fruits of the earth
and their growers in a mass of fire! What a new existence!—what a
temptation above Lucifer's! Would clod be any thing but a clod, if he
could resist it? Why, here was a spectacle last night for a whole
country!—a Bonfire visible to London, alarming her guilty towers, and
shaking the Monument with an ague fit—all done by a little vial of
phosphor in a Clown's fob! How he must grin, and shake his empty noddle
in clouds, the Vulcanian Epicure! Can we ring the bells backward? Can we
unlearn the arts that pretend to civilize, and then burn the world?
There is a march of Science; but who shall beat the drums for its
retreat? Who shall persuade the boor that phosphor will not ignite?</p>
<p>Seven goodly stacks of hay, with corn-barns proportionable, lie smoking
ashes and chaff, which man and beast would sputter out and reject like
those apples of Asphaltes and bitumen. The food for the inhabitants of
earth will quickly disappear. Hot rolls may say: "Fuimus panes, fuit
quartern-loaf, et ingens gloria Apple-pasty-orum." That the good old
munching system may last thy time and mine, good un-incendiary George,
is the devout prayer of thine,</p>

<p>Dear M. A thousand thanks for your punctualities. What a cheap Book is
the last Hogarth you sent me! I am pleased now that Hunt <emphasis>diddled</emphasis> me
out of the old one. Speaking of this, only think of the new farmer with
his 30 acres. There is a portion of land in Lambeth parish called Knaves
Acre. I wonder he overlook'd it. Don't show this to the firm of Dilk &amp;
C'o. I next want one copy of Leicester School, and wish you to pay
Leishman, Taylor, 2 Blandford Place, Pall Mall, opposite the British
Institution, £6. 10. for coat waistcoat &amp;c. And I vehemently thirst for
the 4th No. of Nichols's Hogarth, to bind 'em up (the 2 books) as
"Hogarth, and Supplement." But as you know the price, don't stay for its
appearance; but come as soon as ever you can with your bill of all
demands in full, and, as I have none but £5 notes, bring with you
sufficient change. Weather is beautiful. I grieve sadly for Miss
Wordsworth. We are all well again. Emma is with us, and we all shall be
glad of a sight of you. COME ON Sunday, if you <emphasis>can</emphasis>; better, if you
come before. Perhaps Rogers would smile at this.—A pert half chemist
half apothecary, in our town, who smatters of literature and is
immeasurable unletterd, said to me "Pray, Sir, may not Hood (he of the
acres) be reckon'd the Prince of wits in the present day?" to which I
assenting, he adds "I had always thought that Rogers had been reckon'd
the Prince of Wits, but I suppose that now Mr. Hood has the better title
to that appellation." To which I replied that Mr. R. had wit with much
better qualities, but did not aspire to the principality. He had taken
all the puns manufactured in John Bull for our friend, in sad and stupid
earnest. One more Album verses, please.</p>

<p>    In the early days of the <emphasis>John Bull</emphasis> it was the fashion to lay every
    foundling witticism at the door of Sam Rogers; and thus the refined
    poet and man of letters became known as a sorry jester.</p>
<p><emphasis>John Bull</emphasis> was Theodore Hook's paper. Maginn wrote in <emphasis>Fraser's
Magazine:</emphasis>—</p>
<p>    Joe Miller vails his bonnet to Sam Rogers; in all the newspapers,
    not only of the kingdom but its dependencies,—Hindostan, Canada,
    the West Indies, the Cape, from the tropics,—nay, from the
    Antipodes to the Orkneys, Sam is godfather— general to all the bad
    jokes in existence. The Yankees have caught the fancy, and from New
    Orleans to New York it is the same,—Rogers is synonymous with a
    pun. All British-born or descended people,—yea the very negro and
    the Hindoo—father their calembourgs on Rogers. Quashee, or
    Ramee-Samee, who knows nothing of Sir Isaac Newton, John Milton, or

    illustrious banker, and with gratified voice exclaims, "Him dam

<p>LETTER 529</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. February 3, 1831.]</p>
<p>Dear Moxon, The snows are ancle deep slush and mire, that 'tis hard to
get to the post office, and cruel to send the maid out. 'Tis a slough of
despair, or I should sooner have thankd you for your offer of the
<emphasis>Life</emphasis>, which we shall very much like to have, and will return duly. I
do not know when I shall be in town, but in a week or two at farthest,
when I will come as far as you if I can. We are moped to death with
confinement within doors. I send you a curiosity of G. Dyer's
tender-conscience. Between 30 and 40 years since, G. published the
Poet's Fate, in which were two very harmless lines about Mr. Rogers, but
Mr. R. not quite approving of them, they were left out in a subsequent
edition 1801. But G. has been worryting about them ever since; if I have
heard him once, I have heard him a hundred times express a remorse
proportiond to a consciousness of having been guilty of an atrocious
libel. As the devil would have it, a fool they call <emphasis>Barker</emphasis>, in his
Parriana has quoted the identical two lines as they stood in some
obscure edition anterior to 1801, and the withers of poor G. are again
wrung. His letter is a gem—with his poor blind eyes it has been
laboured out at six sittings. The history of the couplet is in page 3 of
this irregular production, in which every variety of shape and size that
Letters can be twisted into, is to be found. Do <emphasis>shew</emphasis> his part of it to
Mr. R. some day. If he has bowels, they must melt at the contrition so
queerly character'd of a contrite sinner. G. was born I verily think
without original sin, but chuses to have a conscience, as every
Christian Gentleman should have. His dear old face is insusceptible of
the twist they call a sneer, yet he is apprehensive of being suspected
of that ugly appearance. When he makes a compliment, he thinks he has
given an affront. A name is personality. But shew (no hurry) this unique
recantation to Mr. R. 'Tis like a dirty pocket handkerchief muck'd with
tears of some indigent Magdalen. There is the impress of sincerity in
every pot-hook and hanger. And then the gilt frame to such a pauper
picture! It should go into the Museum. I am heartily sorry my Devil does
not answer. We must try it a little longer, and after all I think I must
insist on taking a portion of the loss upon myself. It is too much you
should lose by two adventures. You do not say how your general business
goes on, and I should very much like to talk over it with you here. Come
when the weather will possibly let you. I want to see the Wordsworths,
but I do not much like to be all night away. It is dull enough to be
here together, but it is duller to leave Mary; in short it is painful,
and in a flying visit I should hardly catch them. I have no beds for
them, if they came down, and but a sort of a house to receive them in,
yet I shall regret their departure unseen. I feel cramped and straiten'd
every way. Where are they?</p>
<p>We have heard from Emma but once, and that a month ago, and are very
anxious for another letter.</p>
<p>You say we have forgot your powers of being serviceable to us. <emphasis>That</emphasis> we
never shall. I do not know what I should do without you when I want a
little commission. Now then. There are left at Miss Buffam's, the Tales
of the Castle, and certain vols. Retrospective Review. The first should
be conveyd to Novello's, and the Reviews should be taken to Talfourd's
office, ground floor, East side, Elm Court, Middle Temple, to whom I
should have written, but my spirits are wretched. It is quite an effort
to write this. So, with the <emphasis>Life</emphasis>, I have cut you out 3 Pieces of
service. What can I do for you here, but hope to see you very soon, and
think of you with most kindness. I fear tomorrow, between rains and
snows, it would be impossible to expect you, but do not let a
practicable Sunday pass. We are always at home!</p>
<p>Mary joins in remembrances to your sister, whom we hope to see in any
fine-ish weather, when she'll venture.</p>
<p>Remember us to Allsop, and all the dead people—to whom, and to London,
we seem dead.</p>

<p>LETTER 530</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO GEORGE DYER</strong></p>
<p>Feb. 22nd, 1831.</p>
<p>Dear Dyer,—Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Rogers's friends, are perfectly assured,
that you never intended any harm by an innocent couplet, and that in the
revivification of it by blundering Barker you had no hand whatever. To
imagine that, at this time of day, Rogers broods over a fantastic
expression of more than thirty years' standing, would be to suppose him
indulging his "Pleasures of Memory" with a vengeance. You never penned a
line which for its own sake you need (dying) wish to blot. You mistake
your heart if you think you <emphasis>can</emphasis> write a lampoon. Your whips are rods
of roses. Your spleen has ever had for its objects vices, not the
vicious-abstract offences, not the concrete sinner. But you are
sensitive, and wince as much at the consciousness of having committed a
compliment, as another man would at the perpetration of an affront. But
do not lug me into the same soreness of conscience with yourself. I
maintain, and will to the last hour, that I never writ of you but <emphasis>con
amore</emphasis>. That if any allusion was made to your near-sightedness, it was
not for the purpose of mocking an infirmity, but of connecting it with
scholar-like habits: for is it not erudite and scholarly to be somewhat
near of sight, before age naturally brings on the malady? You could not
then plead the <emphasis>obrepens senectus</emphasis>. Did I not moreover make it an
apology for a certain <emphasis>absence</emphasis>, which some of your friends may have
experienced, when you have not on a sudden made recognition of them in a
casual street-meeting, and did I not strengthen your excuse for this
slowness of recognition, by further accounting morally for the present
engagement of your mind in worthy objects? Did I not, in your person,
make the handsomest apology for absent-of-mind people that was ever
made? If these things be not so, I never knew what I wrote or meant by
my writing, and have been penning libels all my life without being aware
of it. Does it follow that I should have exprest myself exactly in the
same way of those dear old eyes of yours <emphasis>now</emphasis>—now that Father Time has
conspired with a hard task-master to put a last extinguisher upon them?
I should as soon have insulted the Answerer of Salmasius, when he awoke
up from his ended task, and saw no more with mortal vision. But you are
many films removed yet from Milton's calamity. You write perfectly
intelligibly. Marry, the letters are not all of the same size or
tallness; but that only shows your proficiency in the <emphasis>hands</emphasis>—text,
german-hand, court-hand, sometimes law-hand, and affords variety. You
pen better than you did a twelvemonth ago; and if you continue to
improve, you bid fair to win the golden pen which is the prize at your
young gentlemen's academy. But you must beware of Valpy, and his
printing-house, that hazy cave of Trophonius, out of which it was a
mercy that you escaped with a glimmer. Beware of MSS. and Variae
Lectiones. Settle the text for once in your mind, and stick to it. You
have some years' good sight in you yet, if you do not tamper with it. It
is not for you (for <emphasis>us</emphasis> I should say) to go poring into Greek
contractions, and star-gazing upon slim Hebrew points. We have yet the
sight</p>
<p>        Of sun, and moon, and star, throughout the year,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And man and woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You have vision enough to discern Mrs. Dyer from the other comely
gentlewoman who lives up at staircase No. 5; or, if you should make a
blunder in the twilight, Mrs. Dyer has too much good sense to be jealous
for a mere effect of imperfect optics. But don't try to write the Lord's
Prayer, Creed, and Ten Commandments, in the compass of a halfpenny; nor
run after a midge or a mote to catch it; and leave off hunting for
needles in bushels of hay, for all these things strain the eyes. The
snow is six feet deep in some parts here. I must put on jack-boots to
get at the post-office with this. It is not good for weak eyes to pore
upon snow too much. It lies in drifts. I wonder what its drift is; only
that it makes good pancakes, remind Mrs. Dyer. It turns a pretty green
world into a white one. It glares too much for an innocent colour,
methinks. I wonder why you think I dislike gilt edges. They set off a
letter marvellously. Yours, for instance, looks for all the world like a
tablet of curious <emphasis>hieroglyphics</emphasis> in a gold frame. But don't go and lay
this to your eyes. You always wrote hieroglyphically, yet not to come up
to the mystical notations and conjuring characters of Dr. Parr. You
never wrote what I call a schoolmaster's hand, like Clarke; nor a
woman's hand, like Southey; nor a missal hand, like Porson; nor an
all-of-the-wrong-side-sloping hand, like Miss Hayes; nor a dogmatic,
Mede-and-Persian, peremptory hand, like Rickman; but you ever wrote what
I call a Grecian's hand; what the Grecians write (or used) at Christ's
Hospital; such as Whalley would have admired, and Boyer have applauded,
but Smith or Atwood (writing-masters) would have horsed you for. Your
boy-of-genius hand and your mercantile hand are various. By your
flourishes, I should think you never learned to make eagles or
corkscrews, or flourish the governors' names in the writing-school; and
by the tenor and cut of your letters I suspect you were never in it at
all. By the length of this scrawl you will think I have a design upon
your optics; but I have writ as large as I could out of respect to
them—too large, indeed, for beauty. Mine is a sort of deputy Grecian's
hand; a little better, and more of a worldly hand, than a Grecian's, but
still remote from the mercantile. I don't know how it is, but I keep my
rank in fancy still since school-days. I can never forget I was a deputy
Grecian! And writing to you, or to Coleridge, besides affection, I feel
a reverential deference as to Grecians still. I keep my soaring way
above the Great Erasmians, yet far beneath the other. Alas! what am I
now? what is a Leadenhall clerk or India pensioner to a deputy Grecian?
How art thou fallen, O Lucifer! Just room for our loves to Mrs. D., &amp;c.</p>

<p>["I never writ of you but <emphasis>con amore</emphasis>." Lamb refers particularly to the
<emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "Oxford in the Vacation" in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, where
G.D.'s absence of mind and simplicity of character were dwelt upon more
intimately than Dyer liked (see Vol. II.).</p>
<p>Dyer was gradually going blind.</p>
<p>"The Answerer of Salmasius"—Milton.</p>
<p>"Comely" Mrs. Dyer. But in the letter to Mrs. Shelley, Mrs. D. had been

Boyer, Lamb and Coleridge's master, succeeded him in 1776. Smith was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Writing Master at the end of the seventeenth century.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Lamb had never become a Grecian, having an impediment in his speech
which made it impossible that he should take orders, the natural fate of
Grecians, with profit. Great Erasmus and Little Erasmus are still the
names of classes in the Blue-Coat School. Grecians were the Little
Erasmians.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to P.G. Patmore, dated April 10,
1831, in which Lamb says of the publisher of the <emphasis>New Monthly Magazine</emphasis>:
"Nature never wrote Knave upon a face more legible than upon that
fellow's—'Coal-burn him in Beelzebub's deepest pit.' I can promise
little help if you mean literary, when I reflect that for 5 years I have
been feeling the necessity of scribbling but have never found the
power…. <emphasis>Moxon</emphasis> is my go between, call on <emphasis>him</emphasis>, 63 New Bond St., he
is a very good fellow and the bookseller is not yet burn'd into him."
Patmore was seeking a publisher for, I imagine, his <emphasis>Chatsworth</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb, dated April 13, 1831, which Canon
Ainger considers was written to Gary and Mr. Hazlitt to Coleridge. It
states that Lamb is daily expecting Wordsworth.]</p>

<p>    Good Sir, I have received your most kind letter, and it has entered
    my mind as I began to reply, that the Latin tongue has seldom or
    never been used between us as the instrument of converse or
    correspondence. Your letters, filled with Plinian elegancies (more
    than becomes a Quaker), are so alien to Pliny's language, that you
    seem not to have a word (that is, a Roman word) to throw, as the
    saying is, at a dog. Perchance the disuse of Latinising had
    constrained you more than is right to the use of the vernacular. I
    have determined to recall you to the recovery of your lost Latinity

<p>LETTER 533</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. July 14, 1831.]</p>
<p>Collier's Book would be right acceptable. And also a sixth vol. just
publish'd of Nichols's Illustrations of the Literary History of 18th
Century. I agree with you, and do yet <emphasis>not disagree</emphasis> with W.W., as to
H. It rejoyced my heart to read his friendly spirited mention of your
publications. It might be a drawback to my pleasure, that he has tried
to decry my "Nicky," but on deliberate re- and reperusal of his censure
I cannot in the remotest degree understand what he means to say. He and
I used to dispute about Hell Eternities, I taking the affirmative. I
love to puzzle atheists, and—parsons. I fancy it runs in his head,
that I meant to rivet the idea of a personal devil. Then about the
glorious three days! there was never a year or day in my past life,
since I was pen-worthy, that I should not have written precisely as I
have. Logic and modesty are not among H.'s virtues. Talfourd flatters me
upon a poem which "nobody but I could have written," but which I have
neither seen nor heard of—"The Banquet," or "Banqueting Something,"
that has appeared in The Tatler. Know you of it? How capitally the
Frenchman has analysed Satan! I was hinder'd, or I was about doing the
same thing in English, for him to put into French, as I prosified Hood's
midsummer fairies. The garden of <emphasis>cabbage</emphasis> escap'd him, he turns it into
a garden of pot herbs. So local allusions perish in translation. About 8
days before you told me of R.'s interview with the Premier, I, at the
desire of Badams, wrote a letter to him (Badams) in the most moving
terms setting forth the age, infirmities &amp;c. of Coleridge. This letter
was convey'd to [by] B. to his friend Mr. Ellice of the Treasury,
Brother in Law to Lord Grey, who immediately pass'd it on [to] Lord
Grey, who assured him of immediate relief by a grant on the King's
Bounty, which news E. communicated to B. with a desire to confer with me
on the subject, on which I went up to THE Treasury (yesterday fortnight)
and was received by the Great Man with the utmost cordiality, (shook
hands with me coming and going) a fine hearty Gentleman, and, as seeming
willing to relieve any anxiety from me, promised me an answer thro'
Badams in 2 or 3 days at furthest. Meantime Gilman's extraordinary
insolent letter comes out in the Times! As to <emphasis>my</emphasis> acquiescing in this
strange step, I told Mr. Ellice (who expressly said that the thing was
renewable three-yearly) that I consider'd such a grant as almost
equivalent to the lost pension, as from C.'s appearance and the
representations of the Gilmans, I scarce could think C.'s life worth 2
years' purchase. I did not know that the Chancellor had been previously
applied to. Well, after seeing Ellice I wrote in the most urgent manner
to the Gilmans, insisting on an immediate letter of acknowledgment from
Coleridge, or them <emphasis>in his name</emphasis> to Badams, who not knowing C. had come
forward so disinterestedly amidst his complicated illnesses and
embarrassments, to <emphasis>use up</emphasis> an interest, which he may so well need, in
favor of a stranger; and from that day not a letter has B. or even
myself, received from Highgate, unless <emphasis>that publish'd one in the Times
is meant as a general answer to all the friends who have stirr'd to do
C. service</emphasis>! Poor C. is not to blame, for he is in leading strings.—I
particularly wish you would read this part of my note to Mr. Rogers. Now
for home matters—Our next 2 Sundays will be choked up with all the
Sugdens. The third will be free, when we hope you will show your sister
the way to Enfield and leave her with us for a few days. In the mean
while, could you not run down some week day (afternoon, say) and sleep
at the Horse Shoe? I want to have my 2d vol. Elias bound Specimen
fashion, and to consult you about 'em. Kenney has just assured me, that
he has just touch'd £100 from the theatre; you are a damn'd fool if you
don't exact your Tythe of him, and with that assurance I rest</p>
<p>Your Brother fool                                    C.L.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Collier's book would be his <emphasis>History of English Dramatic Poetry</emphasis>, 1831.
Nichols's <emphasis>Illustrations</emphasis> had been begun by John Nichols, and six
volumes were published between 1817 and 1831. It was completed in two
more volumes by his son, John Bowyer Nichols, in 1848 and 1858.</p>
<p>"H."—Leigh Hunt. We do not know what W.W., presumably Wordsworth, had
to say of him; but this is how Hunt had referred to Moxon's publications
and Lamb's <emphasis>Satan in Search of a Wife</emphasis> in <emphasis>The Tatler</emphasis> for June 4, 1831,
the occasion being a review of "Selections from Wordsworth" for
schools:—</p>
<p>    Mr. Moxon has begun his career as a bookseller in singularly high
    taste. He has no connection but with the select of the earth. The
    least thing he does, is to give us a dandy poem, suitable to Bond
    street, and not without wit. We allude to the Byronian brochure,
    entitled "<emphasis>Mischief</emphasis>." But this is a mere condescension to the
    elegance of the street he lives in. Mr. Moxon commenced with some of
    the primaeval delicacies of <emphasis>Charles Lamb</emphasis>. He then astonished us
    with Mr. Rogers' poems on <emphasis>Italy</emphasis>…. Of some of these publications
    we have already spoken,—Mr. Lamb's <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis> among them. And
    why (the reader may ask) not have noticed his <emphasis>Satan in Search of a
    Wife</emphasis>? Because, to say the truth, we did not think it worthy of him.
    We rejoice in Mr. Lamb's accession to the good cause advocated by
    Sterne and Burns, refreshed by the wholesome mirth of Mr. Moncrieff,
    and finally carried (like a number of other astonished humanities,
    who little thought of the matter, and are not all sensible of it
    now) on the triumphant shoulders of the Glorious Three Days. But Mr.
    Lamb, in the extreme sympathy of his delight, has taken for granted,
    that everything that can be uttered on the subject will be held to
    be worth uttering, purely for its own sake, and because it could not
    well have been said twelve months ago. He merges himself, out of the
    pure transport of his good will, into the joyous common-places of
    others; just as if he had joined a great set of children in tossing
    over some mighty bowl of snap-dragon, too scalding to bear; and
    thought that nothing could be so good as to echo their "hurras!"
    Furthermore, we fear that some of his old friends, on the wrong side
    of the <emphasis>House</emphasis>, would think a little of his merriment profane:
    though for our parts, if we are certain of anything in this world,
    it is that nothing can be more Christian.</p>
<p>"The Banquet." I cannot find this poem. It is, I think, not in <emphasis>The</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Tatler</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"How capitally the Frenchman …" I cannot find any French paraphrase of
<emphasis>Satan in Search of a Wife</emphasis>, nor has a search at the Bibliotheque
Nationale in Paris revealed one.</p>
<p>"R.'s interview with the Premier." R. would be Rogers. Perhaps the best
explanation of this portion of Lamb's letter is the following passage
from Mr. Dykes Campbell's memoir of Coleridge:—</p>
<p>On June 26, 1830, died George IV., and with him died the pensions of the
Royal Associates. Apparently they did not find this out until the
following year. In the <emphasis>Englishman's Magazine</emphasis> for June, 1831, attention
was directed to the fact that "intimation had been given to Mr.
Coleridge and his brother Associates that they must expect their
allowances 'very shortly' to cease"—the allowances having been a
personal bounty of the late King. On June 3, 1831, Gillman wrote a
letter to the <emphasis>Times</emphasis>, "in consequence of a paragraph which appeared in
the <emphasis>Times</emphasis> of this day." He states that on the sudden suppression of
the honorarium, representations on Coleridge's behalf were made to Lord
Brougham, with the result that the Treasury (Lord Grey) offered a
private grant of £200, which Coleridge "had felt it his duty most
respectfully to decline." Stuart, however, wrote to King William's son,
the Earl of Munster, pointing out the hardship entailed on Coleridge,
"who is old and infirm, and without other means of subsistence." He begs
the Earl to lay the matter before his royal father. To this a reply
came, excusing the King on account of his "very reduced income," but
promising that the matter shall be laid before His Majesty. To these
letters, which are printed in <emphasis>Letters from the Lake Poets</emphasis> (pages
319-322), the following note is appended: "The annuity … was not
renewed, but a sum of £300 was ultimately handed over to Coleridge by
the Treasury." Even apart from this bounty, Coleridge was not a sufferer
by the withdrawal of the King's pension, for Frere made it up to him
annually.</p>
<p>It is interesting to know that Lamb played so useful and characteristic
a part in this matter.</p>
<p>"The Sugdens." I do not identify these friends.</p>
<p>"2d vol. Elias." This would refer, I think, to the American volume,
published without authority, in 1828, under the title <emphasis>Elia; or, Second
Series</emphasis>, which Lamb told N.P. Willis he liked. It contained three pieces
not by Lamb; the rest made up from the <emphasis>Works</emphasis> and the <emphasis>London
Magazine</emphasis> (see Vol. II., notes).]</p>

<p>[No date. Early August, 1831.]</p>
<p>Dear M.—The <emphasis>R.A</emphasis>. here memorised was George Dawe, whom I knew well and
heard many anecdotes of, from DANIELS and WESTALL, at H. Rogers's—<emphasis>to
each of them</emphasis> it will be well to send a Mag. in my name. It will fly
like wild fire among the R. Academicians and artists. Could you get hold
of Proctor—his chambers are in Lincoln's Inn at Montagu's—or of Janus
Weathercock?—both of their <emphasis>prose</emphasis> is capital. Don't encourage poetry.
The Peter's Net does not intend funny things only. All is fish. And
leave out the sickening Elia at the end. Then it may comprise letters
and characters addrest to Peter—but a signature forces it to be all
characteristic of the one man Elia, or the one man Peter, which cramped
me formerly. I have agreed <emphasis>not</emphasis> for my sister to know the subjects I
chuse till the Mag. comes out; so beware of speaking of 'em, or writing
about 'em, save generally. Be particular about this warning. Can't you
drop in some afternoon, and take a bed?</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Athenaeum</emphasis> has been hoaxed with some exquisite poetry that was 2 or
3 months ago in Hone's Book. I like your 1st No. capitally. But is it
not small? Come and see us, week day if possible.                  C.L.</p>

contributed to the September number his "Recollections of a Late Royal

Daniell, both landscape painters. Westall may have been Richard Westall,

<p>[P.M. Aug. 5, 1831.]</p>
<p>Send, or bring me, Hone's No. for August.</p>
<p>Hunt is a fool, and his critics——The anecdotes of E. and of G.D. are
substantially true. What does Elia (or Peter) care for dates?</p>
<p>That <emphasis>is</emphasis> the poem I mean. I do not know who wrote it, but is in Hone's
book as far back as April.</p>
<p>Tis a poem I envy—<emphasis>that</emphasis> &amp; Montgomery's Last Man (nothing else of his).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I envy the writers, because I feel I could have done something like it.</p>

<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>[Hone was now editing his <emphasis>Year Book</emphasis>. Under the date April 30 had
appeared Edward FitzGerald's poem, "The Meadows in Spring," with the
following introduction:—</p>
<p>These verses are in the old style; rather homely in expression; but I
honestly profess to stick more to the simplicity of the old poets than
the moderns, and to love the philosophical good humor of our old writers
more than the sickly melancholy of the Byronian wits. If my verses be
not good, they are good humored, and that is something.</p>
<p>The editor of <emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>, in reprinting the poem, suggested
delicately that it was by Lamb. There is no such poem by James
Montgomery as "The Last Man." Campbell wrote a "Last Man," and so did
Hood, but I agree with Canon Ainger that what Lamb meant was
Montgomery's "Common Lot." I give the two poems in the Appendix as
illustrations of what Lamb envied.</p>
<p>"Hunt is a fool." In <emphasis>The Tatler</emphasis> for August 1 Leigh Hunt had quoted
much of Lamb's essay on Elliston. I do not, however, find any adverse
criticism.</p>
<p>"E. and G.D." Lamb had written in the August number of <emphasis>The Englishman's
Magazine</emphasis> his "Reminiscences of Elliston." Lamb's article on George Dawe
did not appear till the September number, but perhaps Moxon already had

but in a week or two we shall be very glad to see you; come at a hazard

it—but as a composition for declining it, will you accept some verses
which I meditate to be addrest to you on your father, &amp; prefixable to

some 10 days hence, when I calculate the House will be uninfected. Send

<p>LETTER 538</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. October 24, 1831.]</p>
<p>To address an abdicated monarch is a nice point of breeding. To give him
his lost titles is to mock him; to withhold 'em is to wound him. But his
Minister who falls with him may be gracefully sympathetic. I do honestly
feel for your diminution of honors, and regret even the pleasing cares
which are part and parcel of greatness. Your magnanimous submission, and
the cheerful tone of your renunciation, in a Letter which, without
flattery, would have made an "ARTICLE," and which, rarely as I keep
letters, shall be preserved, comfort me a little. Will it please, or
plague you, to say that when your Parcel came I damned it, for my pen
was warming in my hand at a ludicrous description of a Landscape of an
R.A., which I calculated upon sending you to morrow, the last day you
gave me. Now any one calling in, or a letter coming, puts an end to my
writing for the day. Little did I think that the mandate had gone out,
so destructive to my occupation, so relieving to the apprehensions of
the whole body of R.A.'s. So you see I had not quitted the ship while a
plank was remaining.</p>
<p>To drop metaphors, I am sure you have done wisely. The
very spirit of your epistle speaks that you have a weight off
your mind. I have one on mine. The cash in hand, which,
as * * * * * * less truly says, burns in my pocket. I feel queer
at returning it (who does not?). You feel awkward at re-taking
it (who ought not?) Is there no middle way of adjusting this
fine embarrassment? I think I have hit upon a medium to
skin the sore place over, if not quite to heal it. You hinted
that there might be something under £10 by and by accruing
to me <emphasis>Devil's Money</emphasis>. You are sanguine—say £7: 10s.—that
I entirely renounce and abjure all future interest in, I insist
upon it, and "by Him I will not name" I won't touch a penny
of it. That will split your Loss one half—and leave me conscientious
possessor of what I hold. Less than your assent to this, no proposal
will I accept of.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mr.———, whose name you have left illegible (is it
<emphasis>Sea-gull</emphasis>?) never sent me any book on Christ's Hospit. by which I could
dream that I was indebted to him for a dedication. Did G.D. send his
penny tract to me to convert me to Unitarianism? Dear blundering soul!
why I am as old a one-Goddite as himself. Or did he think his cheap
publication would bring over the Methodists over the way here? However
I'll give it to the pew-opener (in whom I have a little interest,) to
hand over to the Clerk, whose wife she sometimes drinks tea with, for
him to lay before the Deacon, who exchanges the civility of the hat with
him, for him to transmit to the Minister, who shakes hand with him out
of Chapel, and he, in all odds, will —— with it.</p>
<p>I wish very much to see you. I leave it to you to come how you will. We
shall be very glad (we need not repeat) to see your sister, or sisters,
with you—but for you individually I will just hint that a dropping in
to Tea unlook'd for about 5, stopping bread-n-cheese and gin-and-water,
is worth a thousand Sundays. I am naturally miserable on a Sunday, but a
week day evening and Supper is like old times. Set out <emphasis>now</emphasis>, and give
no time to deliberation—</p>
<p><emphasis>P.S</emphasis>.—The 2d vol. of Elia is delightful(-ly bound, I mean) and quite
cheap. Why, man, 'tis a Unique—</p>
<p>If I write much more I shall expand into an article, which I cannot
afford to let you have so cheap.</p>
<p>By the by, to shew the perverseness of human will—while I thought I
<emphasis>must</emphasis> furnish one of those accursed things monthly, it seemed a Labour
above Hercules's "Twelve" in a year, which were evidently Monthly
Contributions. Now I am emancipated, I feel as if I had a thousand
Essays swelling within me. False feelings both.</p>

Bennett, Julia Mrs. Todhunter. The latter personally informed me in 1888
that her Aunt Augusta perfectly recollected all the circumstances [of
the present note]. The incident seems to have taken place at the
residence of Mr. Hume, in Percy Street, Bloomsbury, and it was Amelia
who found the three-pence-halfpenny in the coat which Lamb left behind
him, and who repaired the button-holes. The sister who is described as
'Scots wha ha'e' was Louisa Hume; it was a favourite song with her."

<p>April 14th, 1832.</p>
<p>My dear Coleridge,—Not an unkind thought has passed in my brain about
you. But I have been wofully neglectful of you, so that I do not deserve
to announce to you, that if I do not hear from you before then, I will
set out on Wednesday morning to take you by the hand. I would do it this
moment, but an unexpected visit might flurry you. I shall take silence
for acquiescence, and come. I am glad you could write so long a letter.
Old loves to, and hope of kind looks from, the Gilmans, when I come.</p>
<p>Yours <emphasis>semper idem</emphasis>                                   C.L.</p>

have been in the times of Noah; and the great waters swept it away.

she is crying for mere love over your letter. I wring out less, but not
sincerer, showers.</p>

Mrs. Wilson's Album, and if you, or she, will be the means of procuring
but one pupil for Miss Hazlitt, I will rub up my poor poetic faculty to
the best. But you and she will one day, I hope, bring the Album with you

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR</strong></p>
<p>[No date. October, 1832.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir, pray accept a little volume. 'Tis a legacy from Elia, you'll
see. Silver and Gold had he none, but such as he had, left he you. I do
not know how to thank you for attending to my request about the Album. I
thought you would never remember it. Are not you proud and thankful,
Emma?</p>
<p>Yes, <emphasis>very, both</emphasis>—               EMMA ISOLA.</p>
<p>Many things I had to say to you, which there was not time for. <emphasis>One</emphasis> why
should I forget? 'tis for Rose Aylmer, which has a charm I cannot
explain. I lived upon it for weeks.—</p>
<p>Next I forgot to tell you I knew all your Welch annoyancers, the
measureless Beethams. I knew a quarter of a mile of them. 17 brothers
and 16 sisters, as they appear to me in memory. There was one of them
that used to fix his long legs on my fender, and tell a story of a
shark, every night, endless, immortal. How have I grudged the salt sea
ravener not having had his gorge of him!</p>
<p>The shortest of the daughters measured 5 foot eleven without her shoes.
Well, some day we may confer about them. But they were tall. Surely I
have discover'd the longitude—</p>
<p>Sir, If you can spare a moment, I should be happy to hear from you—that
rogue Robinson detained your verses, till I call'd for them. Don't
entrust a bit of prose to the rogue, but believe me</p>
<p>Your obliged                                                 C.L.</p>
<p>My Sister sends her kind regards.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Crabb Robinson took Landor to see Lamb on September 28, 1832. The
following passage in Forster's <emphasis>Life of Landor</emphasis> describes the visit and
explains this letter:—</p>
<p>The hour he passed with Lamb was one of unalloyed enjoyment. A letter
from Crabb Robinson before he came over had filled him with affection
for that most lovable of men, who had not an infirmity to which his
sweetness of nature did not give something of kinship to a virtue. "I
have just seen Charles and Mary Lamb," Crabb Robinson had written (20th
October, 1831), "living in absolute solitude at Enfield. I find your
poems lying open before Lamb. Both tipsy and sober he is ever muttering
<emphasis>Rose Aylmer</emphasis>. But it is not those lines only that have a curious
fascination for him. He is always turning to <emphasis>Gebir</emphasis> for things that
haunt him in the same way." Their first and last hour was now passed
together, and before they parted they were old friends. I visited Lamb
myself (with Barry Cornwall) the following month, and remember the
boyish delight with which he read to us the verses which Landor has
written in the album of Emma Isola. He had just received them through
Robinson, and had lost little time in making rich return by sending
Landor his Last Essays of Elia.</p>
<p>These were Landor's verses:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>        TO EMMA ISOLA</strong></p>
<p>        Etrurian domes, Pelasgian walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Live fountains, with their nymphs around</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Terraced and citron-scented halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Skies smiling upon sacred ground—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        The giant Alps, averse to France,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Point with impatient pride to those,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Calling the Briton to advance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Amid eternal rocks and snows—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        I dare not bid him stay behind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I dare not tell him where to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The fairest form, the purest mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Ausonia! that e'er sprang from thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>and this is "Rose Aylmer";—</p>
<p>        Ah what avails the sceptred race!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Ah what the form divine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        What every virtue, every grace!</p>

<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

          May weep, but never see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A night of memories and of sighs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I consecrate to thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Of the measureless Bethams Lamb wrote in similar terms, but more fully,
in an article in the <emphasis>New Times</emphasis> in 1825, entitled "Many Friends" (see
Vol. I.).</p>
<p>On April 9, 1834, Landor wrote to Lady Blessington:—</p>
<p>I do not think that you ever knew Charles Lamb, who is lately dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Robinson took me to see him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "Once, and once only, have I seen thy face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Elia! once only has thy tripping tongue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Run o'er my heart, yet never has been left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Impression on it stronger or more sweet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Cordial old man! what youth was in thy years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        What wisdom in thy levity, what soul</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In every utterance of thy purest breast!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of all that ever wore man's form,'tis thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I first would spring to at the gate of Heaven."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I say <emphasis>tripping</emphasis> tongue, for Charles Lamb stammered and spoke hurriedly.
He did not think it worth while to put on a fine new coat to come down
and see me in, as poor Coleridge did, but met me as if I had been a
friend of twenty years' standing; indeed, he told me I had been so, and
shewed me some things I had written much longer ago, and had utterly
forgotten. The world will never see again two such delightful volumes as
"The Essays of Elia;" no man living is capable of writing the worst
twenty pages of them. The Continent has Zadig and Gil Bias, we have Elia
and Sir Roger de Coverly.</p>
<p>Mrs. Fields, writing in the <emphasis>Atlantic Monthly</emphasis> for April, 1866, on
Landor, says that Landor told her of his visit to Lamb and said that
Lamb read to him some poetry and asked his opinion of it. Landor said it
was very good, whereupon Lamb laughed and called Landor the vainest of
men, for it was his own.</p>
<p>In a letter to Southey the lines differed, ending thus:</p>
<p>            Few are the spirits of the glorified</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I'd spring to earlier at the gate of Heaven.]</p>

<p>By the "Epistle to What's his Name" Lamb refers to some lines to himself
which had been printed first in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> in 1825, entitled
"The Epistle to Charles Lamb." See in the Appendix.</p>
<p>"Madame Pasty." Procter had some lines on Madame Pasta.</p>
<p>"My Specimens." Lamb's <emphasis>Dramatic Specimens</emphasis>, which very likely suggested
to Procter the idea of "Dramatic Fragments."</p>
<p>Under the date November 30, 1832, an unsigned letter endorsed "From
Charles Lamb to Professor Wilson" is printed in Mrs. Gordon's

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[Dated by Forster at end: Dec., 1832.]</p>
<p>This is my notion. Wait till you are able to throw away a round sum (say
£1500) upon a speculation, and then —don't do it. For all your loving
encouragem'ts—till this final damp came in the shape of your letter,
thanks—for Books also—greet the Fosters and Proctors—and come singly
or conjunctively as soon as you can. Johnson and Fare's sheets have been
wash'd—unless you prefer Danby's <emphasis>last</emphasis> bed—at the Horseshoe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[I assume Lamb's advice to refer to Moxon's intention of founding a
paper called <emphasis>The Reflector</emphasis>, which Forster was to edit. All trace of
this periodical has vanished, but it existed in December, 1832, for
three numbers, and was then withdrawn. Lamb contributed to it.</p>
<p>Johnson and Fare had just murdered—on December l9—a Mr. Danby, at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enfield. They had met him in the Crown and Horseshoes (see note to next</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>Mr. W.C. Hazlitt prints a note to Moxon in his Bohn edition in which</p>

<p>[P.M. Dec. 23, 1832.]</p>
<p>I am very sorry the poor Reflector is abortive. Twas a child of good
promise for its <emphasis>weeks</emphasis>. But if the chances are so much against it,
withdraw immediately. It is idle up hill waste of money to spend another
stamp on it.</p>

<p>[Around the seal of this note are the words in Lamb's hand: "Obiit
Edwardus Reflector Armiger, 31 Dec., 1832. Natus tres hebdomidas. Pax

<p>The newspaper stamp at that time was fourpence (less 25 per cent.).</p>
<p>Here should come a letter from Lamb to Louisa Badams (<emphasis>née</emphasis> Holcroft),
dated December 31, 1832, not available for this edition, in which, after
some plain speaking about the Westwoods, Lamb refers to the murder of
Mr. Danby at Enfield by Fare and two other men on the night of December
19, and says that he had been in their company at the inn a little
before, and the next morning was asked to give his evidence. Canon
Ainger says that Lamb's story is a hoax, but it reads reasonably enough
and might as easily have happened as not.]</p>

<p>February, 1833.</p>
<p>My dear T.,—Now cannot I call him <emphasis>Serjeant</emphasis>; what is there in a coif?
Those canvas-sleeves protective from ink, when he was a law-chit—a
_Chitty_ling, (let the leathern apron be apocryphal) do more 'specially
plead to the Jury Court of old memory. The costume (will he agnize it?)
was as of a desk-fellow or Socius Plutei. Methought I spied a brother!</p>
<p>That familiarity is extinct for ever. Curse me if I can call him Mr.
Serjeant—except, mark me, in <emphasis>company</emphasis>. Honour where honour is due; but
should he ever visit us, (do you think he ever will, Mary?) what a
distinction should I keep up between him and our less fortunate friend,
H.C.R.! Decent respect shall always be the Crabb's—but, somehow, short
of reverence.</p>
<p>Well, of my old friends, I have lived to see two knighted: one made a
judge, another in a fair way to it. Why am I restive? why stands my sun
upon Gibeah?</p>
<p>Variously, my dear Mrs. Talfourd, (I can be more familiar with her!)
<emphasis>Mrs. Serjeant Talfourd</emphasis>,—my sister prompts me—(these ladies stand
upon ceremonies)—has the congratulable news affected the members of our
small community. Mary comprehended it at once, and entered into it
heartily. Mrs. W—— was, as usual, perverse—wouldn't, or couldn't,
understand it. A Serjeant? She thought Mr. T. was in the law. Didn't
know that he ever 'listed.</p>
<p>Emma alone truly sympathised. <emphasis>She</emphasis> had a silk gown come home that very
day, and has precedence before her learned sisters accordingly.</p>
<p>We are going to drink the health of Mr. and Mrs. Serjeant, with all the

<p>One o Clock.</p>
<p>This instant receiv'd, this instant I answer your's—Dr. Cresswell has
one copy, which I cannot just now re-demand, because at his desire I
have sent a "Satan" to him, which when he ask'd for, I frankly told him,
was imputed a lampoon on HIM!!! I have sent it him, and cannot, till we
come to explanation, go to him or send—</p>
<p>But on the faith of a Gentleman, you shall have it back some day <emphasis>for
another</emphasis>. The 3 I send. I think 2 of the blunders perfectly immaterial.
But your feelings, and I fear <emphasis>pocket</emphasis>, is every thing. I have just time
to pack this off by the 2 o Clock stage. Yours till me meet</p>
<p>At all events I behave more gentlemanlike than Emma did, in returning

<p>[Dr. Cresswell was vicar of Edmonton. Having married the daughter of a
tailor—or so Mr. Fuller Russell states in his account of a conversation
with Lamb in <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>—he was in danger of being ribaldly
associated with Satan's matrimonial adventures in Lamb's ballad. I
cannot explain to what book Lamb refers: possibly to the <emphasis>Last Essays of
Elia</emphasis>, which Moxon, having found errors in, wished to withdraw,
substituting another. The point probably cannot be cleared up. The
sonnets would be Moxon's own, which he had printed privately (see a
later letter).]</p>

<p>[No date. Spring, 1833.]</p>
<p>Dear M. many thanks for the Books; the <emphasis>Faust</emphasis> I will acknowledge to the
Author. But most thanks for one immortal sentence, "If I do not <emphasis>cheat</emphasis>
him, never <emphasis>trust</emphasis> me again." I do not know whether to admire most, the
wit or justness of the sentiment. It has my cordial approbation. My
sense of meum and tuum applauds it. I maintain it, the eighth
commandment hath a secret special reservation, by which the reptile is
exempt from any protection from it; as a dog, or a nigger, he is not a
holder of property. Not a ninth of what he detains from the world is his
own. Keep your hands from picking and stealing is no ways referable to
his acquists. I doubt whether bearing false witness against thy neighbor
at all contemplated this possible scrub. Could Moses have seen the speck
in vision? An ex post facto law alone could relieve him, and we are
taught to expect no eleventh commandment. The out-law to the Mosaic
dispensation!—unworthy to have seen Moses' behind—to lay his
desecrating hands upon Elia! Has the irriverent ark-toucher been struck
blind I wonder—? The more I think of him, the less I think of him. His
meanness is invisible with aid of solar microscope, my moral eye smarts
at him. The less flea that bites little fleas! The great Beast! the
beggarly nit!</p>
<p>More when we meet.</p>
<p>Mind, you'll come, two of you—and couldn't you go off in the morning,
that we may have a daylong curse at him, if curses are not dis-hallowed
by descending so low? Amen.</p>
<p>Maledicatur in extremis.</p>

<p>[Abraham Hayward's translation of Faust was published by Moxon in</p>

<p>We may perhaps assume that Moxon's reply to Lamb's letter stating that</p>

influenza. Mr. W. appears all but dying, he is delirious. Mrs. W. was
taken so last night, that Mary was obliged at midnight to knock up Mrs.
Waller to come and sit up with her. We have had a sick child, who
sleeping, or not sleeping, next me with a pasteboard partition between,
killed my sleep. The little bastard is gone. My bedfellows are Cough and
cramp, we sleep 3 in a bed. Domestic arrangem'ts (Blue Butcher and all)
devolve on Mary. Don't come yet to this house of pest and age. We
propose when E. and you agree on the time, to come up and meet her at
the Buffams', say a week hence, but do you make the appointm't. The
Lachlans send her their love.</p>

<p>May 7, 1833.</p>
<p>By a strange occurrence we have quitted Enfield for ever. Oh! the happy
eternity! Who is Vicar or Lecturer for that detestable place concerns us
not. But Asbury, surgeon and a good fellow, has offered to get you a
Mover and Seconder, and you may use my name freely to him. Except him
and Dr. Creswell, I have no respectable acquaintance in the dreary
village. At least my friends are all in the <emphasis>public</emphasis> line, and it might
not suit to have it moved at a special vestry by John Gage at the Crown
and Horseshoe, licensed victualler, and seconded by Joseph Horner of the
Green Dragon, ditto, that the Rev. J.G. is a fit person to be Lecturer,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>My dear James, I wish you all success, but am too full of my own
emancipation almost to congratulate anyone else. With both our loves to
your father and mother and glorious S.T.C.</p>

<p>[The Rev. James Gillman was the eldest son of Coleridge's physician and

standing as candidate for the vicarship of Enfield, but did not obtain
it. After acting as Under Master of Highgate Grammar School he became in
1836 Rector of Barfreystone, in Kent. In 1847 he became Vicar of Holy
Trinity, Lambeth. He died in 1877.</p>
<p>Mary Lamb having become ill again had been moved to Edmonton, to a

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>End of May nearly, [1833].</p>
<p>Dear Wordsworth, Your letter, save in what respects your dear Sister's
health, chear'd me in my new solitude. Mary is ill again. Her illnesses
encroach yearly. The last was three months, followed by two of
depression most dreadful. I look back upon her earlier attacks with
longing. Nice little durations of six weeks or so, followed by complete
restoration—shocking as they were to me then. In short, half her life
she is dead to me, and the other half is made anxious with fears and
lookings forward to the next shock. With such prospects, it seem'd to me
necessary that she should no longer live with me, and be fluttered with
continual removals, so I am come to live with her, at a Mr. Walden's and
his wife, who take in patients, and have arranged to lodge and board us
only. They have had the care of her before. I see little of her; alas! I
too often hear her. Sunt lachrymae rerum—and you and I must bear it—</p>
<p>To lay a little more load on it, a circumstance has happen'd, <emphasis>cujus
pars magna fui</emphasis>, and which at another crisis I should have more rejoiced
in. I am about to lose my old and only walk-companion, whose mirthful
spirits were the "youth of our house," Emma Isola. I have her here now
for a little while, but she is too nervous properly to be under such a
roof, so she will make short visits, be no more an inmate. With my
perfect approval, and more than concurrence, she is to be wedded to
Moxon at the end of Aug'st. So "perish the roses and the flowers"—how
is it?</p>
<p>Now to the brighter side, I am emancipated from most <emphasis>hated</emphasis> and
<emphasis>detestable</emphasis> people, the Westwoods. I am with attentive people, and
younger—I am 3 or 4 miles nearer the Great City, Coaches half-price
less, and going always, of which I will avail myself. I have few friends
left there, one or two tho' most beloved. But London Streets and faces
cheer me inexpressibly, tho' of the latter not one known one were
remaining.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cordial reception of Elia. Inter nos the Ariadne is
not a darling with me, several incongruous things are in it, but in the
composition it served me as illustrative</p>
<p>I want you in the popular fallacies to like the "Home that is no home"
and "rising with the lark."</p>
<p>I am feeble, but chearful in this my genial hot weather,—walk'd 16
miles yesterd'y. I can't read much in Summer time. With very kindest
love to all and prayers for dear Dorothy,</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. July 24, 1833.]</p>
<p>For god's sake, give Emma no more watches. <emphasis>One</emphasis> has turn'd her head.
She is arrogant, and insulting. She said something very unpleasant to
our old Clock in the passage, as if he did not keep time, and yet he had
made her no appointment. She takes it out every instant to look at the
moment-hand. She lugs us out into the fields, because there the
bird-boys ask you "Pray, Sir, can you tell us what's a Clock," and she
answers them punctually. She loses all her time looking "what the time
is." I overheard her whispering, "Just so many hours, minutes &amp;c. to
Tuesday—I think St. George's goes too slow"—This little present of
Time, why, 'tis Eternity to her—</p>
<p>What can make her so fond of a gingerbread watch?</p>
<p>She has spoil'd some of the movements. Between ourselves, she has kissed
away "half past 12," which I suppose to be the canonical hour in Hanover
Sq.</p>
<p>Well, if "love me, love my watch," answers, she will keep time to you—</p>

<p>[No date. ? July 31, 1833.]</p>
<p>Dear Mr. and Mrs. Moxon—</p>
<p>Time very short. I wrote to Miss Fryer, and had the sweetest letter
about you, Emma, that ever friendship dictated. "I am full of good
wishes, I am crying with good wishes," she says; but you shall see it.—</p>
<p>Dear Moxon, I take your writing most kindly and shall most kindly your
writing from Paris—</p>
<p>I want to crowd another letter to Miss Fry[er] into the little time
after dinner before Post time.</p>
<p>So with 20000 congratulations,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>

<p><strong>C.L.</strong></p>
<p>I am calm, sober, happy. Turn over for the reason.</p>

turning over a new leaf, as I hope you will now.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MY DEAR EMMA AND EDWARD MOXON,</strong></p>
<p>Accept my sincere congratulations, and imagine more good wishes than my
weak nerves will let me put into good set words. The dreary blank of
<emphasis>unanswered questions</emphasis> which I ventured to ask in vain was cleared up on
the wedding-day by Mrs. W. taking a glass of wine, and, with a total
change of countenance, begged leave to drink Mr. and Mrs. Moxon's
health. It restored me, from that moment: as if by an electrical stroke:
to the entire possession of my senses—I never felt so calm and quiet
after a similar illness as I do now. I feel as if all tears were wiped
from my eyes, and all care from my heart.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO H.F. CARY</strong></p>
<p>Sept. 9th, 1833.</p>
<p>Dear Sir,—Your packet I have only just received, owing, I suppose, to
the absence of Moxon, who is flaunting it about <emphasis>à la Parisienne</emphasis> with
his new bride, our Emma, much to his satisfaction and not a little to
our dulness. We shall be quite well by the time you return from
Worcestershire and most most (observe the repetition) glad to see you
here or anywhere.</p>
<p>I will take my time with Darley's act. I wish poets would write a little
plainer; he begins some of his words with a letter which is unknown to
the English typography.</p>
<p>Yours, most truly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>P.S.—Pray let me know when you return. We are at Mr. Walden's,
Church-street, Edmonton; no longer at Enfield. You will be amused to
hear that my sister and I have, with the aid of Emma, scrambled through
the "Inferno" by the blessed furtherance of your polar-star translation.
I think we scarce left anything unmadeout. But our partner has left us,
and we have not yet resumed. Mary's chief pride in it was that she
should some day brag of it to you. Your Dante and Sandys' Ovid are the
only helpmates of translations. Neither of you shirk a word.</p>
<p>Fairfax's Tasso is no translation at all. It's better in some places;
but it merely observes the number of stanzas; as for images, similes,
&amp;c., he finds 'em himself, and never "troubles Peter for the matter."</p>
<p>In haste, dear Gary, yours ever,</p>

<p><strong>C. LAMB.</strong></p>
<p>Has Moxon sent you "Elia," second volume? if not, he shall. Taylor and
we are at law about it.</p>

<p>We shall be most happy to see Emma, dear to every body. Mary's spirits
are much better, and she longs to see again our twelve years' friend.
You shall afternoon sip with me a bottle of superexcellent Port, after
deducting a dinner-glass for them. We rejoyce to have E. come, the
<emphasis>first Visit</emphasis>, without Miss ——, who, I trust, will yet behave well;
but she might perplex Mary with questions. Pindar sadly wants Preface
and notes. Pray, E., get to Snow Hill before 12, for we dine before 2.
We will make it 2. By mistake I gave you Miss Betham's letter, with the
exquisite verses, which pray return to me, or if it be an improved copy,
give me the other, and Albumize mine, keeping the signature. It is too
pretty a family portrait, for you not to cherish.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD MOXON</strong></p>
<p>[P.M. Oct. 17, 1833.]</p>
<p>Dear M.—Get me Shirley (there's a dear fellow) and send it soon. We
sadly want books, and this will be readable again and again, and pay
itself. Tell Emma I grieve for the poor self-punishing self-baffling
Lady; with all our hearts we grieve for the pain and vexation she has
encounterd; but we do not swerve a pin's-thought from the propriety of
your measures. God comfort her, and there's an end of a painful
necessity. But I am glad she goes to see her. Let her keep up all the
kindness she can between them. In a week or two I hope Mary will be
stout enough to come among ye, but she is not now, and I have scruples
of coming alone, as she has no pleasant friend to sit with her in my
absence. We are lonely. I fear the visits must be mostly from you. By
the way omnibuses are 1's/3'd and coach <emphasis>insides</emphasis> sunk to l/6—a hint.
Without disturbance to yourselves, or upsetting the economy of the dear
new mistress of a family, come and see us as often as ever you can. We
are so out of the world, that a letter from either of you now and then,
detailing any thing, Book or Town news, is as good as a newspaper. I
have desperate colds, cramps, megrims &amp;c., but do not despond. My
fingers are numb'd, as you see by my writing. Tell E. I am <emphasis>very good</emphasis>
also. But we are poor devils, that's the truth of it. I won't apply to
Dilke— just now at least—I sincerely hope the pastoral air of Dover
St. will recruit poor Harriet. With best loves to all.</p>
<p>Yours ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>C.L.</strong></p>
<p>Ryle and Lowe dined here on Sunday; the manners of the latter, so
gentlemanly! have attracted the special admiration of our Landlady. She
guest R. to be nearly of my age. He always had an old head on young
shoulders. I fear I shall always have the opposite. Tell me any thing of
Foster [Forster] or any body. Write any thing you think will amuse me. I
do dearly hope in a week or two to surprise you with our appearance in
Dover St….</p>

<p>LETTER 591</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO EDWARD AND EMMA MOXON</strong></p>
<p>Nov. 29th, 1833.</p>
<p>Mary is of opinion with me, that two of these Sonnets are of a higher
grade than any poetry you have done yet. The one to Emma is so pretty! I
have only allowed myself to transpose a word in the third line. Sacred
shall it be for any intermeddling of mine. But we jointly beg that you
will make four lines in the room of the four last. Read "Darby and
Joan," in Mrs. Moxon's first album. There you'll see how beautiful in
age the looking back to youthful years in an old couple is. But it is a
violence to the feelings to anticipate that time in youth. I hope you
and Emma will have many a quarrel and many a make-up (and she is
beautiful in reconciliation!) before the dark days shall come, in which
ye shall say "there is small comfort in them." You have begun a sort of
character of Emma in them very sweetly; carry it on, if you can, through
the last lines.</p>
<p>I love the sonnet to my heart, and you <emphasis>shall</emphasis> finish it, and I'll be
damn'd if I furnish a line towards it. So much for that. The next best
is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                            TO THE OCEAN</strong></p>
<p>            "Ye gallant winds, if e'er your LUSTY CHEEKS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Blew longing lover to his mistress' side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            O, puff your loudest, spread the canvas wide,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is spirited. The last line I altered, and have re-altered it as it
stood. It is closer. These two are your best. But take a good deal of
time in finishing the first. How proud should Emma be of her poets!</p>
<p>Perhaps "O Ocean" (though I like it) is too much of the open vowels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

which Pope objects to. "Great Ocean!" is obvious. "To save sad thoughts"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I think is better (though not good) than for the mind to save herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But 'tis a noble Sonnet. "St. Cloud" I have no fault to find with.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>If I return the Sonnets, think it no disrespect; for I look for a
printed copy. You have done better than ever. And now for a reason I did
not notice 'em earlier. On Wednesday they came, and on Wednesday I was
a-gadding. Mary gave me a holiday, and I set off to Snow Hill. From Snow
Hill I deliberately was marching down, with noble Holborn before me,
framing in mental cogitation a map of the dear London in prospect,
thinking to traverse Wardour-street, &amp;c., when diabolically I was
interrupted by</p>
<p>                Heigh-ho!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                Little Barrow!—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Emma knows him,—and prevailed on to spend the day at his sister's,
where was an album, and (O march of intellect!) plenty of literary
conversation, and more acquaintance with the state of modern poetry than
I could keep up with. I was positively distanced. Knowles' play, which,
epilogued by me, lay on the PIANO, alone made me hold up my head. When I
came home I read your letter, and glimpsed at your beautiful sonnet,</p>
<p>"Fair art them as the morning, my young bride,"</p>
<p>and dwelt upon it in a confused brain, but determined not to open them
till next day, being in a state not to be told of at Chatteris. Tell it
not in Gath, Emma, lest the daughters triumph! I am at the end of my
tether. I wish you could come on Tuesday with your fair bride. Why can't
you! Do. We are thankful to your sister for being of the party. Come,
and <emphasis>bring</emphasis> a sonnet on Mary's birthday. Love to the whole Moxonry, and
tell E. I every day love her more, and miss her less. Tell her so from
her loving uncle, as she has let me call myself. I bought a fine
embossed card yesterday, and wrote for the Pawnbrokeress's album. She is
a Miss Brown, engaged to a Mr. White. One of the lines was (I forget the
rest—but she had them at twenty-four hours' notice; she is going out to
India with her husband):—</p>
<p>            "May your fame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fortune, Frances, WHITEN with your name!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Not bad as a pun. I <emphasis>wil</emphasis> expect you before two on Tuesday. I am well
and happy, tell E.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Moxon subsequently published his <emphasis>Sonnets</emphasis>, in two parts, one of which
was dedicated to his brother and one to Wordsworth. There are several to
his wife, so that it is difficult to identify that in which the last
lines were to be altered. Mrs. Moxon's first album was an extract book
in which Lamb had copied a number of old ballads and other poems.</p>
<p>I quote one of Moxon's many sonnets to Emma Moxon:—</p>
<p>        Fair art thou as the morning, my young Bride!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Her freshness is about thee; like a river</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To the sea gliding with sweet murmur ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thou sportest; and, wherever thou dost glide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Humanity a livelier aspect wears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Fair art thou as the morning of that land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Where Tuscan breezes in his youth have fanned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thy grandsire oft. Thou hast not many tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Save such as pity from the heart will wring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And then there is a smile in thy distress!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Meeker thou art than lily of the spring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Yet is thy nature full of nobleness!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And gentle ways, that soothe and raise me so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That henceforth I no worldly sorrow know!</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO SAMUEL ROGERS</strong></p>
<p>[No date. Probably Saturday, December 21, 1833.]</p>
<p>My dear Sir,—Your book, by the unremitting punctuality of your
publisher, has reached me thus early. I have not opened it, nor will
till to-morrow, when I promise myself a thorough reading of it. "The
Pleasures of Memory" was the first school present I made to Mrs. Moxon,
it had those nice wood-cuts; and I believe she keeps it still. Believe
me, that all the kindness you have shown to the husband of that
excellent person seems done unto myself. I have tried my hand at a
sonnet in "The Times." But the turn I gave it, though I hoped it would
not displease you, I thought might not be equally agreeable to your
artist. I met that dear old man at poor Henry's—with you—and again at
Cary's—and it was sublime to see him sit deaf and enjoy all that was
going on in mirth with the company. He reposed upon the many graceful,
many fantastic images he had created; with them he dined and took wine.</p>
<p>I have ventured at an antagonist copy of verses in "The Athenaeum" to
<emphasis>him</emphasis>, in which he is as everything and you as nothing. He is no lawyer
who cannot take two sides. But I am jealous of the combination of the
sister arts. Let them sparkle apart. What injury (short of the theatres)
did not Boydell's "Shakespeare Gallery" do me with Shakespeare?—to have
Opie's Shakespeare, Northcote's Shakespeare, light-headed Fuseli's
Shakespeare, heavy-headed Romney's Shakespeare, wooden-headed West's
Shakespeare (though he did the best in "Lear"), deaf-headed Reynolds's
Shakespeare, instead of my, and everybody's Shakespeare. To be tied down
to an authentic face of Juliet! To have Imogen's portrait! To confine
the illimitable! I like you and Stothard (you best), but "out upon this
half-faced fellowship." Sir, when I have read the book I may trouble
you, through Moxon, with some faint criticisms. It is not the
flatteringest compliment, in a letter to an author, to say you have not
read his book yet. But the devil of a reader he must be who prances
through it in five minutes, and no longer have I received the parcel. It
was a little tantalizing to me to receive a letter from Landor, <emphasis>Gebir</emphasis>
Landor, from Florence, to say he was just sitting down to read my
"Elia," just received, but the letter was to go out before the reading.
There are calamities in authorship which only authors know. I am going
to call on Moxon on Monday, if the throng of carriages in Dover Street
on the morn of publication do not barricade me out.</p>
<p>With many thanks, and most respectful remembrances to your sister,</p>
<p>Yours,</p>

<p>Thomas Stothard, then in his seventy-ninth year, Lamb had met at Henry
Rogers', who had died at Christmas, 1832. The following was the copy of
verses printed in <emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>, December 21, 1833 ("that most
romantic tale" was <emphasis>Peter Wilkins</emphasis>):—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>               TO T. STOTHARD, ESQ.</strong></p>
<p>      <emphasis>On his Illustrations of the Poems of Mr. Rogers</emphasis></p>
<p>      Consummate Artist, whose undying name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With classic Rogers shall go down to fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Be this thy crowning work! In my young days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How often have I with a child's fond gaze</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Pored on the pictured wonders thou hadst done:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Clarissa mournful, and prim Grandison!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      All Fielding's, Smollett's heroes, rose to view;</p>
<empty-line/>

      I saw, and I believed the phantoms true.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But, above all, that most romantic tale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Did o'er my raw credulity prevail,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where Glums and Gawries wear mysterious things,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That serve at once for jackets and for wings.</p>

      Age, that enfeebles other men's designs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But heightens thine, and thy free draught refines.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In several ways distinct you make us feel—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      <emphasis>Graceful</emphasis> as Raphael, as Watteau <emphasis>genteel</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Church Street, Edmonton.</p>
<p>Dear Mary Betham—I received the Bill, and when it is payable, some ten
or twelve days hence, will punctually do with the overplus as you
direct: I thought you would like to know it came to hand, so I have not
waited for the uncertainty of when your nephew sets out. I suppose my
receipt will serve, for poor Mary is not in a capacity to sign it. After
being well from the end of July to the end of December, she was taken
ill almost on the first day of the New Year, and is as bad as poor
creature can be. I expect her fever to last 14 or 15 weeks—if she gets
well at all, which every successive illness puts me in fear of. She has
less and less strength to throw it off, and they leave a dreadful
depression after them. She was quite comfortable a few weeks since, when
Matilda came down here to see us.</p>
<p>You shall excuse a short letter, for my hand is unsteady. Indeed, the
situation I am in with her shakes me sadly. She was quite able to
appreciate the kind legacy while she was well. Imagine her kindest love
to you, which is but buried awhile, and believe all the good wishes for
your restoration to health from</p>

<p>LETTER 599</p>
<p>CHARLES LAMB TO Miss FRYER</p>
<p>Feb. 14, 1834.</p>
<p>Dear Miss Fryer,—Your letter found me just returned from keeping my
birthday (pretty innocent!) at Dover-street. I see them pretty often. I
have since had letters of business to write, or should have replied
earlier. In one word, be less uneasy about me; I bear my privations very
well; I am not in the depths of desolation, as heretofore. Your
admonitions are not lost upon me. Your kindness has sunk into my heart.
Have faith in me! It is no new thing for me to be left to my sister.
When she is not violent, her rambling chat is better to me than the
sense and sanity of this world. Her heart is obscured, not buried; it
breaks out occasionally; and one can discern a strong mind struggling
with the billows that have gone over it. I could be nowhere happier than
under the same roof with her. Her memory is unnaturally strong; and from
ages past, if we may so call the earliest records of our poor life, she
fetches thousands of names and things that never would have dawned upon
me again, and thousands from the ten years she lived before me. What
took place from early girlhood to her coming of age principally lives
again (every important thing and every trifle) in her brain with the
vividness of real presence. For twelve hours incessantly she will pour
out without intermission all her past life, forgetting nothing, pouring
out name after name to the Waldens as a dream; sense and nonsense;
truths and errors huddled together; a medley between inspiration and
possession. What things we are! I know you will bear with me, talking of
these things. It seems to ease me; for I have nobody to tell these
things to now. Emma, I see, has got a harp! and is learning to play. She
has framed her three Walton pictures, and pretty they look. That is a
book you should read; such sweet religion in it—next to Woolman's!
though the subject be baits and hooks, and worms, and fishes. She has my
copy at present to do two more from.</p>
<p>Very, very tired, I began this epistle, having been epistolising all the
morning, and very kindly would I end it, could I find adequate
expressions to your kindness. We did set our minds on seeing you in
spring. One of us will indubitably. But I am not skilled in almanac
learning, to know when spring precisely begins and ends. Pardon my
blots; I am glad you like your book. I wish it had been half as worthy
of your acceptance as "John Woolman." But 'tis a good-natured book.</p>

discard the new version altogether. As <emphasis>you</emphasis> may be more fastidious in
singing mere silliness, and a string of well-sounding images without
sense or coherence—Drums of Tartars, who use <emphasis>none</emphasis>, and Tulip trees
ten foot high, not to mention Spirits in Sunbeams &amp;c,—than we are, so
you are at liberty to sacrifice an enspiriting movement to a little
sense, tho' I like LITTLE-SENSE less than his vagarying younger sister
NO-SENSE—so I send them——</p>
<p>The 4th line of 1st stanza is from an old Ballad.</p>
<p>Emma is looking weller and handsomer (as you say) than ever. Really, if
she goes on thus improving, by the time she is nine and thirty she will
be a tolerable comely person. But I may not live to see it.—I take
Beauty to be <emphasis>catching</emphasis>— a Cholera sort of thing—Now, whether the
constant presence of a handsome object—for there's only two of us—may
not have the effect———but the subject is delicate, and as my old
great Ant* used to say—"Andsome is as andsome duzz"—that was my
great Ant's way of spelling——</p>

<p>LETTER 601</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH</strong></p>
<p>Church S't, Edmonton,</p>
<p>22 feb. [1834].</p>
<p>Dear Wordsworth, I write from a house of mourning. The oldest and best
friends I have left, are in trouble. A branch of them (and they of the
best stock of God's creatures, I believe) is establishing a school at
Carlisle. Her name is Louisa Martin, her address 75 Castle Street,
Carlisle; her qualities (and her motives for this exertion) are the most
amiable, most upright. For thirty years she has been tried by me, and on
her behaviour I would stake my soul. O if you can recommend her, how
would I love you—if I could love you better. Pray, pray, recommend her.
She is as good a human creature,—next to my Sister, perhaps the most
exemplary female I ever knew. Moxon tells me, you would like a Letter
from me. You shall have one. <emphasis>This</emphasis> I cannot mingle up with any nonsense
which you usually tolerate from, C. LAMB. Need he add loves to Wife,
Sister, and all? Poor Mary is ill again, after a short lucid interval of
4 or 5 months. In short, I may call her half dead to me.</p>
<p>Good you are to me. Yours with fervor of friendship; for ever</p>
<p>turn over</p>
<p>If you want references, the Bishop of Carlisle may be one. Louisa's
Sister, (as good as she, she cannot be better tho' she tries,) educated
the daughters of the late Earl of Carnarvon, and he settled a handsome
Annuity on her for life. In short all the family are a sound rock. The
present Lord Carnarvon married Howard of Graystock's Sister.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Wordsworth has written on the wrapper, "Lamb's last letter."</p>
<p>We met the Martins in the early correspondence. It was Louisa whom, many
years, before, Lamb used to call "Monkey."</p>
<p>Here should come Lamb's last letter to Thomas Manning, dated May 10,
1834. Mary has, he says, been ill for nigh twenty weeks; "she is, I
hope, recovering." "I struggle to town rarely, and then to see London,
with little other motive—for what is left there hardly? The streets and
shops entertaining ever, else I feel as in a desert, and get me home to
my cave." Once a month, he adds, he passes a day with Cary at the
Museum. When Mary was getting better in the previous year she would read
all the auctioneers' advertisements on the walk. "These are <emphasis>my</emphasis>
Play-bills," she said. "I walk 9 or 10 miles a day, always up the road,
dear Londonwards." Addressed to Manning at Puckeridge.</p>
<p>Manning lived on, an eccentric recluse, until 1840.</p>
<p>Here perhaps should come the following melancholy letter to Talfourd,
which Mr. Dobell permits me to print:—]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>LETTER 602</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO T.N. TALFOURD</strong></p>
<p>[No date. Early 1834?]</p>
<p>D'r T.—[1]Moxon &amp; Knowles are coming to Enfield on Sunday <emphasis>afternoon</emphasis>.
My poor shaken head cannot at present let me ask any dinner company; for
two drinkings in a day, which must ensue, would incapacity me. I am very
poorly. They can only get an Edmont'n stage, from which village 'tis but
a 2 miles walk, &amp; I have only <emphasis>inn beds</emphasis> to offer. <emphasis>Pray</emphasis>, join 'em if
you can. Our first morning stage to London is 1/2 past 8. If that won't
suit your avocations, arrange with Ryle (or without him)—but how can I
separate him morally?—logically and legally, poetically and critically
I can,—from you? No disparagement (for a better Christian exists
not)—well arrange <emphasis>cum</emphasis> or <emphasis>absque illo</emphasis>—this is latin— the first
Sunday you can, <emphasis>morning</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I am poorly, but I always am on these occasions, a week or two. Then I
get sober,—I mean less insober. Yours till death; you are mine <emphasis>after</emphasis>.
Don't mind a touch of pathos. Love to Mrs. Talfourd.</p>

<p>We heard the Music in the Abbey at Winchmore Hill! and the notes were
incomparably soften'd by the distance. Novello's chromatics were
distinctly audible. Clara was faulty in B flat. Otherwise she sang like

mine, and I thought they might travel with them. But keep 'em as much
longer as you like. I never trouble my head with other people's
quarrels, I do not always understand my own. I seldom see them in Dover
Street. I know as little as the Man in the Moon about your joint
transactions, and care as little. If you have lost a little portion of
my "good will," it is that you do not come and see me. Arrange with
Procter, when you have done with your moving accidents.</p>

<p>LETTER 605</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO J. FULLER RUSSELL</strong></p>
<p>[Summer, 1834.]</p>
<p>M'r Lamb's compt's and shall be happy to look over the lines as soon as
ever Mr. Russell shall send them. He is at Mr. Walden's, Church, <emphasis>not
Bury</emphasis>—St, Edm'd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Line</emphasis> 10. "Ween," and "wist," and "wot," and "eke" are antiquated
frippery, and unmodernize a poem rather than give it an antique air, as
some strong old words may do. "I guess," "I know," "I knew," are quite
as significant.</p>
<p>31. Why "ee"—barbarous Scoticism!—when "eye" is much better and chimes
to "cavalry"? A sprinkling of dis-used words where all the style else is
after the approved recent fashion teases and puzzles.</p>
<p>37.         [Anon the storm begins to slake, The sullen clouds to melt
away, The moon becalmed in a blue lake Looks down with melancholy ray.]</p>
<p>The moon becalmed in a blue lake would be more apt to <emphasis>look up</emphasis>. I see
my error—the sky is the lake—and beg you to laugh at it.</p>
<p>59. What is a maiden's "een," south of the Tweed? You may as well call
her prettily turned ears her "lugs."</p>
<p>            "On the maiden's lugs they fall" (verse 79).</p>
<p>144. "A coy young Miss" will never do. For though you are presumed to be
a modern, writing only of days of old, yet you should not write a word
purely unintelligible to your heroine. Some understanding should be kept
up between you. "Miss" is a nickname not two centuries old; came in at
about the Restoration. The "King's Misses" is the oldest use of it I can
remember. It is Mistress Anne Page, not Miss Page. Modern names and
usages should be kept out of sight in an old subject. W. Scott was sadly
faulty in this respect.</p>
<p>208. [Tear of sympathy.] Pity's sacred dew. Sympathy is a young lady's
word, rife in modern novels, and is almost always wrongly applied. To
sympathize is to feel—<emphasis>with</emphasis>, not simply <emphasis>for</emphasis> another. I write
verses and <emphasis>sympathize</emphasis> with you. You have the tooth ache, I have not;
I feel for you, I cannot sympathize.</p>
<p>243. What is "sheen"? Has it more significance than "bright"? Richmond
in its old name was Shene. Would you call an omnibus to take you to
Shene? How the "all's right" man would stare!</p>
<p>363.        [The violet nestled in the shade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Which fills with perfume all the glade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Yet bashful as a timid maid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Thinks to elude the searching eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Of every stranger passing by,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Might well compare with Emily.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A strangely involved simile. The maiden is likend [<emphasis>sic</emphasis>] to a <emphasis>violet</emphasis>
which has been just before likened to a <emphasis>maid</emphasis>. Yet it reads prettily,
and I would not have it alter'd.</p>
<p>420. "Een" come again? In line 407 you speak it out "eye," bravely like
an Englishman.</p>
<p>468. Sorceresses do not entice by wrinkles, but, being essentially aged,
appear in assumed beauty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[This communication and that which follows (with trifling omissions)
were sent to <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis> by the late Mr. J. Fuller Russell,
F.S.A., with this explanation: "I was residing at Enfield in the
Cambridge Long Vacation, 1834, and—perhaps to the neglect of more
improving pursuits—composed a metrical novel, named 'Emily de Wilton,'
in three parts. When the first of them was completed, I ventured to
introduce myself to Charles Lamb (who was living at Edmonton at the
time), and telling him what I had done, and that I had 'scarcely heart
to proceed until I had obtained the opinion of a competent judge
respecting my verses,' I asked him to 'while away an idle hour in their
perusal,' adding, 'I fear you will think me very rude and very
intrusive, but I am one of the most nervous souls in Christendom.'
Moved, possibly, by this diffident (not to say unusual) confession, Elia
speedily gave his consent."</p>
<p>The poem was never printed. Lamb's pains in this matter serve to show
how kindly disposed he was in these later years to all young men; and
how exact a sense of words he had.</p>
<p>In the British Museum is preserved a sheet of similar comments made by
Lamb upon a manuscript of P.G. Patmore's, from which I have quoted a few
passages above. In <emphasis>Charles Lamb and the Lloyds</emphasis> will also be found a
number of interesting criticisms on a translation of Homer.]</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO J. FULLER RUSSELL</strong></p>

<p>Sir,—I hope you will finish "Emily." The story I cannot at this stage
anticipate. Some looseness of diction I have taken liberty to advert to.
It wants a little more severity of style. There are too many
prettinesses, but parts of the Poem are better than pretty, and I thank
you for the perusal.</p>

<p>Line 42. "The old abbaye" (if abbey <emphasis>was</emphasis> so spelt) I do not object to,
because it does not seem your own language, but humoursomely adapted to
the "how folks called it in those times."</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>A father's "sneer"? Would a high-born man in those days <emphasis>sneer</emphasis> at a
daughter's disgrace—would he <emphasis>only</emphasis> sneer?</p>
<p>            Reproach, and biting shame, and—worse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Than all—the estranged father's curse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I only throw this hint out in a hurry.</p>
<p>177. "Stern and <emphasis>sear</emphasis>"? I see a meaning in it, but no word is good that
startles one at first, and then you have to make it out: "drear,"
perhaps. Then why "to minstrel's glance"? "To fancy's eye," you would
say, not "to fiddler's eye."</p>
<p>422. A knight thinks, he don't "trow."</p>
<p>424. "Mayhap" is vulgarish. Perchance.</p>
<p>464. "Sensation" is a philosophic prose word. Feeling.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>Natural illustrations come more naturally when by <emphasis>them</emphasis> we expound
mental operations than when we deduce from natural objects similes of
the mind's workings. The miser's struggle thus compared is a beautiful
image. But the storm and clouds do not inversely so readily suggest the
miser.</p>

<p>These personified gentry I think are not in taste. Besides, Fear has
been pallid any time these 2,000 years. It is mixing the style of
Aeschylus and the <emphasis>Last Minstrel</emphasis>.</p>
<p>175. Bracy is a good rough vocative. No better suggests itself, unless
Grim, Baron Grimm, or Grimoald, which is Saxon, or Grimbald! Tracy would
obviate your objection [that the name Bracy occurs in <emphasis>Ivanhoe</emphasis>] but
Bracy is stronger.</p>

<p>Holy abbots surely never so undisguisedly blurted out their secular

<p>I think there is so much of this kind of poetry, that it would not be
<emphasis>very taking</emphasis>, but it is well worthy of pleasing a private circle. One
blemish runs thro', the perpetual accompaniment of natural images.
Seasons of the year, times of day, phases of the moon, phenomena of
flowers, are quite as much your <emphasis>dramatis personae</emphasis> as the warriors and
the ladies. This last part is as good as what precedes.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO CHARLES WENTWORTH DILKE</strong></p>
<p>[No date. End of July, 1834.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir, I am totally incapable of doing what you suggest at present,
and think it right to tell you so <emphasis>without delay</emphasis>. It would shock me,
who am shocked enough already, to sit down to <emphasis>write</emphasis> about it. I have
no letters of poor C. By and bye what scraps I have shall be yours. Pray
excuse me. It is not for want of obliging you, I assure you. For your

<empty-line/>
<p>[Coleridge's death had occurred on July 25, in his sixty-second year;
and Dilke had written to Lamb asking for some words on that event, for
<emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>. A little while later a request was made by John Forster
that Lamb would write something for the album of a Mr. Keymer. It was
then that Lamb wrote the few words that stand under the title "On the
Death of Coleridge" (see Vol. I.). Forster wrote thus of the effect of
Coleridge's death upon Lamb:—</p>
<p>    He thought of little else (his sister was but another portion of
    himself) until his own great spirit joined his friend. He had a
    habit of venting his melancholy in a sort of mirth. He would, with
    nothing graver than a pun, "cleanse his bosom of the perilous stuff
    that weighed" upon it. In a jest, or a few light phrases, he would
    lay open the last recesses of his heart. So in respect of the death
    of Coleridge. Some old friends of his saw him two or three weeks
    ago, and remarked the constant turning and reference of his mind. He
    interrupted himself and them almost every instant with some play of
    affected wonder, or astonishment, or humorous melancholy, on the
    words, "<emphasis>Coleridge is dead</emphasis>." Nothing could divert him from that,
    for the thought of it never left him.</p>
<p>Wordsworth said that Coleridge's death hastened Lamb's.]</p>

<p>Edmonton, August 5, 1834.</p>
<p>My dear Sir,—The sad week being over, I must write to you to say, that
I was glad of being spared from attending; I have no words to express my
feeling with you all. I can only say that when you think a short visit
from me would be acceptable, when your father and mother shall be able
to see me <emphasis>with comfort</emphasis>, I will come to the bereaved house. Express to
them my tenderest regards and hopes that they will continue our friends
still. We both love and respect them as much as a human being can, and

of the Tun at Heidelburg, the Clock at Strasburg, the statue at
Rotterdam, the dainty Rhenish and poignant Moselle wines, Westphalian

<p>LETTER 610</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO H.F. CARY</strong></p>
<p>Oct., 1834.</p>
<p>I protest I know not in what words to invest my sense of the shameful
violation of hospitality, which I was guilty of on that fatal Wednesday.
Let it be blotted from the calendar. Had it been committed at a layman's
house, say a merchant's or manufacturer's, a cheesemonger's' or
greengrocer's, or, to go higher, a barrister's, a member of
Parliament's, a rich banker's, I should have felt alleviation, a drop of
self-pity. But to be seen deliberately to go out of the house of a
clergyman drunk! a clergyman of the Church of England too! not that
alone, but of an expounder of that dark Italian Hierophant, an
exposition little short of <emphasis>his</emphasis> who dared unfold the Apocalypse: divine
riddles both and (without supernal grace vouchsafed) Arks not to be
fingered without present blasting to the touchers. And, then, from what
house! Not a common glebe or vicarage (which yet had been shameful), but
from a kingly repository of sciences, human and divine, with the primate
of England for its guardian, arrayed in public majesty, from which the
profane vulgar are bid fly. Could all those volumes have taught me
nothing better! With feverish eyes on the succeeding dawn I opened upon
the faint light, enough to distinguish, in a strange chamber not
immediately to be recognised, garters, hose, waistcoat, neckerchief,
arranged in dreadful order and proportion, which I knew was not mine
own. 'Tis the common symptom, on awaking, I judge my last night's
condition from. A tolerable scattering on the floor I hail as being too
probably my own, and if the candlestick be not removed, I assoil myself.
But this finical arrangement, this finding everything in the morning in
exact diametrical rectitude, torments me. By whom was I divested?
Burning blushes! not by the fair hands of nymphs, the Buffam Graces?
Remote whispers suggested that I <emphasis>coached</emphasis> it home in triumph—far be
that from working pride in me, for I was unconscious of the locomotion;
that a young Mentor accompanied a reprobate old Telemachus; that, the
Trojan like, he bore his charge upon his shoulders, while the wretched
incubus, in glimmering sense, hiccuped drunken snatches of flying on the
bats' wings after sunset. An aged servitor was also hinted at, to make
disgrace more complete: one, to whom my ignominy may offer further
occasions of revolt (to which he was before too fondly inclining) from
the true faith; for, at a sight of my helplessness, what more was needed
to drive him to the advocacy of independency? Occasion led me through
Great Russell Street yesterday. I gazed at the great knocker. My feeble
hands in vain essayed to lift it. I dreaded that Argus Portitor, who
doubtless lanterned me out on that prodigious night. I called the
Elginian marbles. They were cold to my suit. I shall never again, I
said, on the wide gates unfolding, say without fear of thrusting back,
in a light but a peremptory air, "I am going to Mr. Cary's." I passed by
the walls of Balclutha. I had imaged to myself a zodiac of third
Wednesdays irradiating by glimpses the Edmonton dulness. I dreamed of
Highmore! I am de-vited to come on Wednesdays. Villanous old age that,
with second childhood, brings linked hand in hand her inseparable twin,
new inexperience, which knows not effects of liquor. Where I was to have
sate for a sober, middle-aged-and-a-half gentleman, literary too, the
neat-fingered artist can educe no notions but of a dissolute Silenus,
lecturing natural philosophy to a jeering Chromius or a Mnasilus. Pudet.
From the context gather the lost name of ——.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>["The Buffam Graces." Lamb's landladies at Southampton Buildings.</p>
<p>"I passed by the walls of Balclutha." From Ossian. Lamb uses this
quotation in his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on the South-Sea House.</p>
<p>"Highmore." I cannot explain this reference.</p>
<p>Not long before Mrs. Procter's death a letter from Charles Lamb to Mrs.
Basil Montagu was sold, in which Lamb apologised for having become
intoxicated while visiting her the night before. Some one mentioned the
letter in Mrs. Procter's presence. "Ah," she said, "but they haven't
seen the second letter, which I have upstairs, written next day, in
which he said that my mother might ask him again with safety as he never
got drunk twice in the same house." Unhappily, a large number of Lamb's
and other letters were burned by Mrs. Procter.]</p>

<p>Dear Sir,—The unbounded range of munificence presented to my choice
staggers me. What can twenty votes do for one hundred and two widows? I
cast my eyes hopeless among the viduage. N.B.—Southey might be ashamed
of himself to let his aged mother stand at the top of the list, with his
£100 a year and butt of sack. Sometimes I sigh over No. 12, Mrs.
Carve-ill, some poor relation of mine, no doubt. No. 15 has my wishes;
but then she is a Welsh one. I have Ruth upon No. 21. I'd tug hard for
No. 24. No. 25 is an anomaly: there can be no Mrs. Hogg. No. 34 ensnares
me. No. 73 should not have met so foolish a person. No. 92 may bob it as
she likes; but she catches no cherry of me. So I have even fixed at
hap-hazard, as you'll see.</p>

<p><strong>CHARLES LAMB TO MR. CHILDS</strong></p>
<p>Monday. Church Street, EDMONTON (not Enfield, as you erroneously direct
yours). [? Dec., 1834.]</p>
<p>Dear Sir,—The volume which you seem to want, is not to be had for love
or money. I with difficulty procured a copy for myself. Yours is gone to
enlighten the tawny Hindoos. What a supreme felicity to the author (only
he is no traveller) on the Ganges or Hydaspes (Indian streams) to meet a
smutty Gentoo ready to burst with laughing at the tale of Bo-Bo! for
doubtless it hath been translated into all the dialects of the East. I
grieve the less, that Europe should want it. I cannot gather from your
letter, whether you are aware that a second series of the Essays is
published by Moxon, in Dover-street, Piccadilly, called "The Last Essays
of Elia," and, I am told, is not inferior to the former. Shall I order a
copy for you, and will you accept it? Shall I <emphasis>lend</emphasis> you, at the same
time, my sole copy of the former volume (Oh! return it) for a month or
two? In return, you shall favour me with the loan of one of those
Norfolk-bred grunters that you laud so highly; I promise not to keep it
above a day. What a funny name Bungay is! I never dreamt of a
correspondent thence. I used to think of it as some Utopian town or
borough in Gotham land. I now believe in its existence, as part of merry
England!</p>

<p>The part I have scratched out is the best of the letter. Let me have
your commands.</p>
<p>CH. LAMB, <emphasis>alias</emphasis> ELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Talfourd thus explains this letter: "In December, 1834, Mr. Lamb
received a letter from a gentleman, a stranger to him—Mr. Childs of
Bungay, whose copy of <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> had been sent on an Oriental voyage, and
who, in order to replace it, applied to Mr. Lamb." Mr. Childs was a
printer. His business subsequently became that of Messrs. R.&amp;R. Clark,
which still flourishes.</p>
<p>This letter practically disposes of the statement made by more than one
bibliographer that a second edition of Elia was published in 1833. The
tale of Bo-Bo is in the "Dissertation on Roast Pig."</p>
<p>Lamb sent Mr. Childs a copy of <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>, in which he wrote:—]</p>

lost or left at your house on Thursday. It was the book I went out to
fetch from Miss Buffam's, while the tripe was frying. It is called
Phillip's Theatrum Poetarum; but it is an English book. I think I left
it in the parlour. It is Mr. Cary's book, and I would not lose it for
the world. Pray, if you find it, book it at the Swan, Snow Hill, by an
Edmonton stage immediately, directed to Mr. Lamb, Church-street,
Edmonton, or write to say you cannot find it. I am quite anxious about
it. If it is lost, I shall never like tripe again.</p>

<p>Miss JAMES TO JANE NORRIS</p>
<p>41 Alpha Road, Regent's Park,</p>
<p>London, July 25, 1843.</p>
<p>Madam,—Miss Lamb, having seen the Death of your dear Mother in the
Times News Paper, is most anxious to hear from or to see one of you, as
she wishes to know how you intend settling yourselves, and to have a
full account of your dear Mother's last illness. She was much shocked on
reading of her death, and appeared very vexed that she had not been to
see her, [and] wanted very much to come down and see you both; but we
were really afraid to let her take the journey. If either of you are
coming up to town, she would be glad if you would call upon her, but
should you not be likely to come soon, she would be very much pleased if
one of you would have the goodness to write a few lines to her, as she
is most anxious about you. She begs you to excuse her writing to you
herself, as she don't feel equal to it; she asked me yesterday to write
for her. I am happy to say she is at present pretty well, although your
dear Mother's death appears to dwell much upon her mind. She desires her
kindest love to you both, and hopes to hear from you very soon, if you
are equal to writing. I sincerely hope you will oblige her, and am,</p>
<p>Madam,</p>
<p>Your obedient, &amp;c.,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>SARAH JAMES.</strong></p>
<p>Pray don't invite her to come down to see you.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

              From Earth's short bondage free,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And left to us its leaden day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And mist-enshrouded sea.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Here, by the restless ocean's side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Sweet hours of hope have flown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            When first the triumph of its tide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Seem'd omen of our own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            That eager joy the sea-breeze gave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              When first it raised his hair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Sunk with each day's retiring wave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Beyond the reach of prayer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            The sun-blink that through drizzling mist,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To flickering hope akin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Lone waves with feeble fondness kiss'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              No smile as faint can win;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Yet not in vain, with radiance weak,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               The heavenly stranger gleams—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Not of the world it lights to speak,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              But that from whence it streams.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            That world our patient sufferer sought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Serene with pitying eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            As if his mounting Spirit caught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              The wisdom of the skies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            With boundless love it look'd abroad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              For one bright moment given;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Shone with a loveliness that aw'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And quiver'd into Heaven.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            A year made slow by care and toil</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Has paced its weary round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Since Death enrich'd with kindred spoil</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              The snow-clad, frost-ribb'd ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Then LAMB, with whose endearing name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Our boy we proudly graced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Shrank from the warmth of sweeter fame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Than mightier Bards embraced.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Still 'twas a mournful joy to think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Our darling might supply</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            For years to us, a living link,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To name that cannot die.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            And though such fancy gleam no more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              On earthly sorrow's night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Truth's nobler torch unveils the shore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Which lends to both its light.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            The nurseling there that hand may take,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              None ever grasp'd in vain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And smiles of well-known sweetness wake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Without their tinge of pain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Though,'twixt the Child and child-like Bard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Late seemed distinction wide.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            They now may trace in Heaven's regard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              How near they were allied.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Within the infant's ample brow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Blythe fancies lay unfurl'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Which, all uncrush'd, may open now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To charm a sinless world.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Though the soft spirit of those eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Might ne'er with LAMB'S compete—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Ne'er sparkle with a wit as wise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Or melt in tears, as sweet;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            That calm and unforgotten look</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              A kindred love reveals,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            With his who never friend forsook,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Or hurt a thing that feels.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            In thought profound, in wildest glee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              In sorrows dark and strange,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            The soul of Lamb's bright infancy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Endured no spot or change.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            From traits of each our love receives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              For comfort, nobler scope;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            While light, which child-like genius leaves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Confirms the infant's hope;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            And in that hope with sweetness fraught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Be aching hearts beguiled,</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

            Of knights and ladies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              While the wind sings:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  Oh! drearily sings!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            I never look out,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Nor attend to the blast;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            For, all to be seen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Is the leaves falling fast:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  Falling, falling!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            But, close at the hearth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Like a cricket, sit I;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Reading of summer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And chivalry:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  Gallant chivalry!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Then, with an old friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              I talk of our youth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            How 'twas gladsome, but often</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Foolish, forsooth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                 But gladsome, gladsome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Or, to get merry,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              We sing an old rhyme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            That made the wood ring again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              In summer time:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  Sweet summer time!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Then take we to smoking,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Silent and snug:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Naught passes between us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Save a brown jug;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  Sometimes! sometimes!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            And sometimes a tear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Will rise in each eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Seeing the two old friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              So merrily;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  So merrily!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            And ere to bed</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

              And the meadows are green,—</p>

              Break the old pipe in twain;</p>

<p>A Birth-day Meditation, during a solitary winter walk of seven miles,
between a village in Derbyshire and Sheffield, when the ground was
covered with snow, the sky serene, and the morning air intensely pure.</p>
<p>        Once in the flight of ages past,</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

        —Mortal! howe'er thy lot be cast,</p>

        We know that these were felt by him,</p>

<p>        He suffer'd,—but his pangs are o'er;</p>
<empty-line/>

        Enjoy'd,—but his delights are fled;</p>

        Had friends,—his friends are now no more;</p>

        Hath lost in its unconscious womb:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O. she was fair!—but nought could save</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Her beauty from the tomb.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        He saw whatever thou hast seen;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Encounter'd all that troubles thee:</p>

<p>

        He was—whatever thou hast been;</p>

        Mixing wisdom with their wine;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or, perhaps, thy wit so fine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Strayeth in some elder book,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whereon our modern Solons look</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With severe ungifted eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wondering what thou seest to prize.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Happy thou, whose skill can take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Pleasure at each turn, and slake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thy thirst by every fountain's brink,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where less wise men would pause to shrink:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Sometimes, 'mid stately avenues</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With Cowley thou, or Marvel's muse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Dost walk; or Gray, by Eton's towers;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or Pope, in Hampton's chesnut bowers;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or Walton, by his loved Lea stream:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or dost thou with our Milton dream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of Eden and the Apocalypse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And hear the words from his great lips?</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
</section>
<section>
<p>        Speak,—in what grove or hazel shade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For "musing meditation made,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Dost wander?—or on Penshurst Lawn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where Sidney's fame had time to dawn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And die, ere yet the hate of Men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Could envy at his perfect pen?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or, dost thou, in some London street,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        (With voices fill'd and thronging feet,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Loiter, with mien 'twixt grave and gay?—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or take along some pathway sweet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thy calm suburban way?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Happy beyond that man of Ross,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whom mere content could ne'er engross,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Art thou,—with hope, health, "learned leisure;"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Friends, books, thy thoughts, an endless pleasure!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        —Yet—yet,—(for when was pleasure made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Sunshine all without a shade?)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thou, perhaps, as now thou rovest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Through the busy scenes thou lovest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With an Idler's careless look,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Turning some moth-pierced book,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Feel'st a sharp and sudden woe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For visions vanished long ago!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And then thou think'st how time has fled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Over thy unsilvered head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Snatching many a fellow mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Away, and leaving—what?—behind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Nought, alas! save joy and pain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Mingled ever, like a strain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of music where the discords vie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With the truer harmony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So, perhaps, with thee the vein</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Is sullied ever,—so the chain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of habits and affections old,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Like a weight of solid gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Presseth on thy gentle breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Till sorrow rob thee of thy rest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Ay: so't must be!—Ev'n I, (whose lot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The fairy Love so long forgot,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Seated beside this Sherris wine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And near to books and shapes divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which poets, and the painters past</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Have wrought in lines that aye shall last,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ev'n I, with Shakspeare's self beside me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And one whose tender talk can guide me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Through fears, and pains, and troublous themes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whose smile doth fall upon my dreams</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Like sunshine on a stormy sea,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Want <emphasis>something</emphasis>—when I think of thee!</p>

*** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE WORKS OF CHARLES AND MARY LAMB — VOLUME 6 ***</p>
<p>
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.</p>
<p>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>
<p>START: FULL LICENSE</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</p>
<p>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>
<p>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works</p>
<p>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
<p>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
<p>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>
<p>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.</p>
<p>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>
<p>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
<p>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>
<p>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
<p>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.</p>
<p>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>
<p>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
<p>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>
<p>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
<p>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>
<p>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>

goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
