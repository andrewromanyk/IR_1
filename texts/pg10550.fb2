<p><strong>[PREFACE TO THE FORMER EDITION.[1]]</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This play agrees perfectly with the description given of it in the
title; it is certainly a most pleasant conceited comedy, rich in humour,
and written altogether in a right merry vein. The humour is broad and
strongly marked, and at the same time of the most diverting kind; the
characters are excellent, and admirably discriminated; the comic parts
of the play are written with most exquisite drollery, and the serious
with great truth and feeling. Of the present piece there were seven
editions, within a short period, with all of which the present reprint
has been carefully collated, and is now, for the first time, divided
into acts and scenes.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>The Exchange</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> YOUNG MASTER ARTHUR <emphasis>and</emphasis> YOUNG MASTER LUSAM.</p>
<p>Y. ART. I tell you true, sir; but to every man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not be so lavish of my speech:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Only to you, my dear and private friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Although my wife in every eye be held</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of beauty and of grace sufficient,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of honest birth and good behaviour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Able to win the strongest thoughts to her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet, in my mind, I hold her the most hated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And loathed object, that the world can yield.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. O Master Arthur, bear a better thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of your chaste wife, whose modesty hath won</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The good opinion and report of all:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By heaven! you wrong her beauty; she is fair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Not in mine eye.</p>
<p>Y. LUS. O, you are cloy'd with dainties, Master Arthur,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And too much sweetness glutted hath your taste,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And makes you loathe them: at the first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You did admire her beauty, prais'd her face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were proud to have her follow at your heels</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through the broad streets, when all censuring tongues</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Found themselves busied, as she pass'd along,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'extol her in the hearing of you both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tell me, I pray you, and dissemble not,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have you not, in the time of your first-love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hugg'd such new popular and vulgar talk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gloried still to see her bravely deck'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now a kind of loathing hath quite chang'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your shape of love into a form of hate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But on what reason ground you this hate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. My reason is my mind, my ground my will;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not love her: if you ask me why,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot love her. Let that answer you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. Be judge, all eyes, her face deserves it not;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then on what root grows this high branch of hate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is she not loyal, constant, loving, chaste:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Obedient, apt to please, loath to displease:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Careful to live, chary of her good name,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And jealous of your reputation?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is she not virtuous, wise, religious?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How should you wrong her to deny all this?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good Master Arthur, let me argue with you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                        [<emphasis>They walk aside</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MASTER ANSELM <emphasis>and</emphasis> MASTER FULLER.</p>
<p>FUL. O Master Anselm! grown a lover, fie!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What might she be, on whom your hopes rely?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. What fools they are that seem most wise in love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How wise they are that are but fools in love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before I was a lover, I had reason</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To judge of matters, censure of all sorts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, I had wit to call a lover fool,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And look into his folly with bright eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now intruding love dwells in my brain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And franticly hath shoulder'd reason thence:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am not old, and yet, alas! I doat;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have not lost my sight, and yet am blind;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No bondman, yet have lost my liberty;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No natural fool, and yet I want my wit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What am I, then? let me define myself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A dotard young, a blind man that can see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A witty fool, a bondman that is free.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Good aged youth, blind seer, and wise fool,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Loose your free bonds, and set your thoughts to school.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> OLD MASTER ARTHUR <emphasis>and</emphasis> OLD MASTER LUSAM.</p>
<p>O. ART. 'Tis told me, Master Lusam, that my son</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And your chaste daughter, whom we match'd together,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wrangle and fall at odds, and brawl and chide.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Nay, I think so, I never look'd for better:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This 'tis to marry children when they're young.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I said as much at first, that such young brats</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would 'gree together e'en like dogs and cats.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Nay, pray you, Master Lusam, say not so;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There was great hope, though they were match'd but young,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their virtues would have made them sympathise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And live together like two quiet saints.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. You say true, there was great hope, indeed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They would have liv'd like saints; but where's the fault?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. If fame be true, the most fault's in my son.</p>
<p>O. LUS. You say true, Master Arthur, 'tis so indeed.</p>
<p>O. ART. Nay, sir, I do not altogether excuse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your daughter; many lay the blame on her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Ah! say you so? by the mass, 'tis like enough,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For from her childhood she hath been a shrew.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. A shrew? you wrong her; all the town admires her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For mildness, chasteness, and humility.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. 'Fore God, you say well, she is so indeed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The city doth admire her for these virtues.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. O, sir, you praise your child too palpably;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She's mild and chaste, but not admir'd so much.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, so I say—I did not mean admir'd.</p>
<p>O. ART. Yes, if a man do well consider her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your daughter is the wonder of her sex.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Are you advis'd of that? I cannot tell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What 'tis you call the wonder of her sex,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But she is—is she?—ay, indeed, she is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. What is she?</p>
<p>O. LUS. Even what you will—you know best what she is.</p>
<p>ANS. Yon is her husband: let us leave this talk:[3]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How full are bad thoughts of suspicion;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I love, but loathe myself for loving so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet cannot change my disposition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. <emphasis>Medice, cura teipsum</emphasis>.</p>
<p>ANS. <emphasis>Hei mihi! quod nullis amor est medicabilis herbis</emphasis>.</p>
<p>                             [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> ANSELM and FULLER.</p>
<p>Y. ART. All your persuasions are to no effect,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Never allege her virtues nor her beauty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My settled unkindness hath begot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A resolution to be unkind still,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My ranging pleasures love variety.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. O, too unkind unto so kind a wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too virtueless to one so virtuous,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And too unchaste unto so chaste a matron.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. But soft, sir, see where my two fathers are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Busily talking; let us shrink aside,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For if they see me, they are bent to chide.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                   [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> Y. ARTHUR <emphasis>and</emphasis> Y. LUSAM.</p>
<p>O. ART. I think 'tis best to go straight to the house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make them friends again; what think ye, sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. I think so too.</p>
<p>O. ART. Now I remember, too, that's not so good:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For divers reasons, I think best stay here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And leave them to their wrangling—what think you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. I think so too.</p>
<p>O. ART. Nay, we will go, that's certain.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, 'tis best, 'tis best—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In sooth, there's no way but to go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Yet if our going should breed more unrest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More discord, more dissension, more debate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More wrangling where there is enough already?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twere better stay than go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. 'Fore God, 'tis true;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our going may, perhaps, breed more debate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then we may too late wish we had stay'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And therefore, if you will be rul'd by me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We will not go, that's flat: nay, if we love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our credits or our quiets, let's not go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. But if we love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their credits or their quiets, we must go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And reconcile them to their former love;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where there is strife betwixt a man and wife 'tis hell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And mutual love may be compared to heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For then their souls and spirits are at peace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Master Lusam, now 'tis dinner-time;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When we have dined, the first work we will make,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is to decide their jars for pity's sake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Well fare a good heart! yet are you advis'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go, said you, Master Arthur? I will run</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To end these broils, that discord hath begun.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                    [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>SCENE II.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Young Arthur's House</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR <emphasis>and</emphasis> PIPKIN.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Come hither, Pipkin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How chance you tread so softly?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. For fear of breaking, mistress.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Art thou afraid of breaking, how so?</p>
<p>PIP. Can you blame me, mistress? I am crack'd already.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Crack'd, Pipkin, how? hath any crack'd your crown?</p>
<p>PIP. No, mistress; I thank God,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My crown is current, but—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. But what?</p>
<p>PIP. The maid gave me not my supper yesternight, so that indeed my belly
wambled, and standing near the great sea-coal fire in the hall, and not
being full, on the sudden I crack'd, and you know, mistress, a pipkin is
soon broken.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Sirrah, run to the Exchange, and if you there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can find my husband, pray him to come home;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tell him I will not eat a bit of bread</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until I see him; prythee, Pipkin, run.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. By'r Lady, mistress, if I should tell him so, it may be he would
not come, were it for no other cause but to save charges; I'll rather
tell him, if he come not quickly, you will eat up all the meat in the
house, and then, if he be of my stomach, he will run every foot, and
make the more haste to dinner.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Ay, thou may'st jest; my heart is not so light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It can digest the least conceit of joy:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Entreat him fairly, though I think he loves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All places worse that he beholds me in.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wilt thou begone?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. Whither, mistress? to the 'Change?</p>
<p>MRS ART. Ay, to the 'Change.</p>
<p>PIP. I will, mistress: hoping my master will go so oft to the 'Change,
that at length he will change his mind, and use you more kindly. O, it
were brave if my master could meet with a merchant of ill-ventures, to
bargain with him for all his bad conditions, and he sell them outright!
you should have a quieter heart, and we all a quieter house. But hoping,
mistress, you will pass over all these jars and squabbles in good health,
as my master was at the making thereof, I commit you.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Make haste again, I prythee. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> PIPKIN.] Till I see him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart will never be at rest within me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My husband hath of late so much estrang'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His words, his deeds, his heart from me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I can seldom have his company;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And even that seldom with such discontent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such frowns, such chidings, such impatience,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That did not truth and virtue arm my thoughts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They would confound me with despair and hate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make me run into extremities.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had I deserv'd the least bad look from him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I should account myself too bad to live,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But honouring him in love and chastity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All judgments censure freely of my wrongs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                   [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> YOUNG MASTER ARTHUR, YOUNG MASTER LUSAM, <emphasis>and</emphasis> PIPKIN.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Pipkin, what said she when she sent for me?</p>
<p>PIP. 'Faith, master, she said little, but she thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

[The] more, for she was very melancholy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Did I not tell you she was melancholy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For nothing else but that she sent for me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fearing I would come to dine with her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. O, you mistake her; even, upon my soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I durst affirm you wrong her chastity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See where she doth attend your coming home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Come, Master Arthur, shall we in to dinner?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sirrah, begone, and see it served in.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. Will you not speak unto her?</p>
<p>Y. ART. No, not I; will you go in, sir.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Not speak to me! nor once look towards me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is my duty to begin, I know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will break this ice of courtesy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are welcome home, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Hark, Master Lusam, if she mock me not!
<emphasis>You are welcome home, sir</emphasis>. Am I welcome home?
Good faith, I care not if I be or no.</p>
<p>Y. LUS. Thus you misconstrue all things, Master Arthur.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Look, if her true love melt not into tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. She weeps, but why? that I am come so soon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hinder her of some appointed guests,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That in my absence revel in my house:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She weeps to see me in her company,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, were I absent, she would laugh with joy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She weeps to make me weary of the house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Knowing my heart cannot away with grief.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Knew I that mirth would make you love my bed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would enforce my heart to be more merry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Do you not hear? she would enforce her heart!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All mirth is forc'd, that she can make with me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. O misconceit, how bitter is thy taste!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet Master Arthur, Mistress Arthur too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me entreat you reconcile these jars,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Odious to heaven, and most abhorr'd of men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. You are a stranger, sir; but by your words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You do appear an honest gentleman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you profess to be my husband's friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Persist in these persuasions, and be judge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all indifference in these discontents.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet husband, if I be not fair enough</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To please your eye, range where you list abroad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Only, at coming home, speak me but fair:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you delight to change, change when you please,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So that you will not change your love to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you delight to see me drudge and toil,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll be your drudge, because 'tis your delight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or if you think me unworthy of the name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of your chaste wife, I will become your maid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your slave, your servant—anything you will,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If for that name of servant and of slave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You will but smile upon me now and then.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or if, as I well think, you cannot love me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Love where you list, only but say you love me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll feed on shadows, let the substance go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will you deny me such a small request?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, will you neither love nor flatter me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, then I see your hate here doth but wound me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with that hate it is your frowns confound me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. Wonder of women! why, hark you, Master Arthur!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What is your wife, a woman or a saint?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wife or some bright angel come from heav'n?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are you not mov'd at this strange spectacle?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This day I have beheld a miracle.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I attempt this sacred nuptial life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I beg of heaven to find me such a wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Ha, ha! a miracle, a prodigy!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To see a woman weep is as much pity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As to see foxes digg'd out of their holes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If thou wilt pleasure me, let me see thee less;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grieve much; they say grief often shortens life:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come not too near me, till I call thee, wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that will be but seldom. I will tell thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How thou shalt win my heart—die suddenly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I'll become a lusty widower:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The longer thy life lasts, the more my hate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And loathing still increaseth towards thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I come home and find thee cold as earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then will I love thee: thus thou know'st my mind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Master Lusam, let us in to dine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. O, sir, you too much affect this evil;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Poor saint! why wert thou yok'd thus with a devil?    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>

<p>                    [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> Y. ART. <emphasis>and</emphasis> Y. LUS.</p>
<p>MRS ART. If thou wilt win my heart, die suddenly!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But that my soul was bought at such a rate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At such a high price as my Saviour's blood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not stick to lose it with a stab;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, virtue, banish all such fantasies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is my husband, and I love him well;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Next to my own soul's health I tender him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And would give all the pleasures of the world</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To buy his love, if I might purchase it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll follow him, and like a servant wait,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And strive by all means to prevent his hate.</p>

<p>O. LUS. How? Go in? How say you, sir?</p>
<p>O. ART. I say 'tis best.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, sir, say you so? so say I too.</p>
<p>O. ART. Nay, nay, it is not best; I'll tell you why.</p>

Haply the fire of hate is quite extinct</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the dead embers; now to rake them up,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should the least spark of discontent appear,</p>
<empty-line/>

To make the flame of hatred burn afresh,</p>

The heat of this dissension might scorch us;</p>

Which, in his own cold ashes smother'd up,</p>

May die in silence, and revive no more:</p>

And therefore tell me, is it best or no?</p>

<p>O. ART. I say it is not best.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Mass, you say well, sir, and so say I too.</p>
<p>O. ART. But shall we lose our labour to come hither,</p>

<p>

And, without sight of our two children,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go back again? nay, we will in, that's sure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. In, quotha! do you make a doubt of that;</p>

Shall we come thus far, and in such post-haste,</p>

And have our children here, and both within,</p>

And not behold them e'er our back-return?</p>

It were unfriendly and unfatherly.</p>

Come, Master Arthur, pray you follow me.</p>

<p>O. ART. Nay, but hark you, sir, will you not knock?</p>
<p>O. LUS. Is't best to knock?</p>
<p>O. ART. Ay, knock in any case.</p>
<p>O. LUS. 'Twas well you put it in my mind to knock,</p>

I had forgotten it else, I promise you.</p>

And shall we two stand knocking? Lead the way.</p>

Now thou hast slept a little on thy love?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Like one that strives to shun a little plash</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of shallow water, and (avoiding it)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Plunges into a river past his depth:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like one that from a small spark steps aside,</p>

And falls in headlong to a greater flame.</p>

If she be fire, thou art so far from burning,</p>

<p>

That thou hast scarce yet warm'd thee at her face;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But list to me, I'll turn thy heart from love,</p>

<p>

And make thee loathe all of the feminine sex.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They that have known me, knew me once of name</p>

<p>

To be a perfect wencher: I have tried</p>

All sorts, all sects, all states, and find them still</p>

Inconstant, fickle, always variable.</p>

Attend me, man! I will prescribe a method,</p>

How thou shalt win her without all peradventure.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>FUL. I was once like thee,</p>

<p>

A sigher, melancholy humorist,</p>

Crosser of arms, a goer without garters,</p>
<empty-line/>

A hatband-hater, and a busk-point[4] wearer,</p>

One that did use much bracelets made of hair,</p>

<p>

Rings on my fingers, jewels in mine ears,</p>

And now and then a wench's carcanet,</p>

Scarfs, garters, bands, wrought waistcoats, gold-stitch'd caps,</p>

<p>

A thousand of those female fooleries; but when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I look'd into the glass of reason, straight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I began to loathe that female bravery,</p>

And henceforth studied[5] to cry</p>

<emphasis>Peccavi</emphasis> to the world.</p>

Prescribe a means to win my best-belov'd.</p>

Be not too apish-female; do not come</p>

With foolish sonnets to present her with,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With legs, with curtsies, congees, and such like:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor with penn'd speeches, or too far-fetch'd sighs:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hate such antique, quaint formality.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. O, but I cannot snatch[6] occasion:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She dashes every proffer with a frown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. A frown, a fool! art thou afraid of frowns?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that will leave occasion for a frown,</p>

<p>

Were I his judge (all you his case bemoan),</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His doom should be ever to lie alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. I cannot choose but, when a wench says nay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To take her at her word, and leave my suit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Continue that opinion, and be sure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To die a virgin chaste, a maiden pure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It was my chance once, in my wanton days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To court a wench; hark, and I'll tell thee how:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I came unto my love, and she look'd coy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I spake unto my love, she turn'd aside,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I touch'd my love, and 'gan with her to toy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But she sat mute, for anger or for pride;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I striv'd and kiss'd my love, she cry'd <emphasis>Away</emphasis>!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou wouldst have left her thus—I made her stay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I catch'd my love, and wrung her by the hand:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I took my love, and set her on my knee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pull'd her to me; O, you spoil my band,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You hurt me, sir; pray, let me go, quoth she.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'm glad, quoth I, that you have found your tongue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And still my love I by the finger wrung.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I ask'd her if she lov'd me; she said, No.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I bad her swear; she straight calls for a book;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay then, thought I, 'tis time to let her go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I eas'd my knee, and from her cast a look.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She leaves me wond'ring at these strange affairs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And like the wind she trips me up the stairs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I left the room below, and up I went,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Finding her thrown upon her wanton bed:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I ask'd the cause of her sad discontent;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Further she lies, and, making room, she said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, sweeting, kiss me, having time and place;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So clings me to her with a sweet embrace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Is't possible? I had not thought till now,</p>

That women could dissemble. Master Fuller,</p>

Here dwells the sacred mistress of my heart;</p>

And hear the utmost what these people say.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Thou art a knave, although thou be my son.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have I with care and trouble brought thee up,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be a staff and comfort to my age,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A pillar to support me, and a crutch</p>
<empty-line/>

To lean on in my second infancy,</p>
<empty-line/>

And dost thou use me thus? Thou art a knave.</p>

Though I be weak and old, I'll prove thee one.</p>

To wrong me with the scorned name of knave,</p>

I will not have you so familiar,</p>

Nor so presume upon my patience.</p>

But you, sir, that are but my father-in-law,</p>

But, sir, you might have us'd my daughter better,</p>

Than to have beat her, spurn'd her, rail'd at her</p>

Before our faces.</p>

Thou show'dst thyself no better than a knave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, marry, did he, I will stand to it:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To use my honest daughter in such sort,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He show'd himself no better than a knave.</p>

<p>Y. ART. I say, again, I am an honest man;</p>

He wrongs me that shall say the contrary.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. I grant, sir, that you are an honest man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor will I say unto the contrary:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But wherefore do you use my daughter thus?</p>

<p>

Can you accuse her of unchastity, of loose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Demeanour, disobedience, or disloyalty?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Speak, what canst thou object against my daughter?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Accuse her! here she stands; spit in her face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If she be guilty in the least of these.</p>

<p>MRS ART. O father, be more patient; if you wrong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My honest husband, all the blame be mine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because you do it only for my sake.</p>

I am his handmaid; since it is his pleasure</p>

To use me thus, I am content therewith,</p>

You shall not choose, but let me be myself.</p>

But, for my husband's sake, let these woes be.</p>

For when I weep, 'tis not for my own care,</p>

But fear, lest folly bring him to despair.</p>

Nothing more rare than such a virtuous woman.

<p>MRS ART. My husband in this humour, well I know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Plays but the unthrift; therefore it behoves me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be the better housewife here at home;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To save and get, whilst he doth laugh and spend:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though for himself he riots it at large,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My needle shall defray my household's charge.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Bustle yourself, see where she sits at work;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be not afraid, man; she's but a woman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And women the most cowards seldom fear:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Think but upon my former principles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And twenty pound to a drachm,[7] you speed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Ay, say you so?</p>
<p>FUL. Beware of blushing, sirrah,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of fear and too much eloquence!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rail on her husband, his misusing her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make that serve thee as an argument,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That she may sooner yield to do him wrong.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were it my case, my love and I to plead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have't at fingers' ends: who could miss the clout,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Having so fair a white, such steady aim.</p>
<empty-line/>

This is the upshot: now bid for the game.</p>

Doth he begin with; what an ass is he,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To tell her at the first that she is fair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The only means to make her to be coy!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He should have rather told her she was foul,</p>

And brought her out of love quite with herself;</p>

<p>

And, being so, she would the less have car'd,</p>

Upon whose secrets she had laid her love.</p>

He hath almost marr'd all with that word fair.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.[8]]</p>

To say, God save you! is the fellow mad?</p>

<p>

Once to name God in his ungodly suit.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Or with my husband? pray you, what's your will?</p>

<p>FUL. She answers to the purpose; what's your will?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O zounds, that I were there to answer her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Mistress, my will is not so soon express'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without your special favour, and the promise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of love and pardon, if I speak amiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. O ass! O dunce! O blockhead! that hath left</p>
<empty-line/>

To travel round about by circumstance:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He might have told his meaning in a word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now hath lost his opportunity.</p>
<empty-line/>

Never was such a truant in love's school;</p>
<empty-line/>

I am asham'd that e'er I was his tutor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Sir, you may freely speak, whate'er it be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So that your speech suiteth with modesty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. To this now could I answer passing well.</p>
<p>ANS. Mistress, I, pitying that so fair a creature—</p>
<p>FUL. Still fair, and yet I warn'd the contrary.</p>
<p>ANS. Should by a villain be so foully us'd,</p>

My love and service to your sacred self.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Indifferent, that was not much amiss.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Sir, what you mean by service and by love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not know; but what you mean by villain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I fain would know.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. That villain is your husband,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose wrongs towards you are bruited through the land.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, can you suffer at a peasant's hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unworthy once to touch this silken skin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be so rudely beat and buffeted?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can you endure from such infectious breath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Able to blast your beauty, to have names</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of such impoison'd hate flung in your face?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. O, that was good, nothing was good but that;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That was the lesson that I taught him last.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. O, can you hear your never-tainted fame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wounded with words of shame and infamy?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, can you see your pleasures dealt away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And you to be debarr'd all part of them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bury it in deep oblivion?</p>

Shall your true right be still contributed</p>

'Mongst hungry bawds, insatiate courtesans?</p>
<empty-line/>

And can you love that villain, by whose deed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your soul doth sigh, and your distress'd heart bleed?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. All this as well as I could wish myself.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Sir, I have heard thus long with patience;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If it be me you term a villain's wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In sooth you have mistook me all this while,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And neither know my husband nor myself;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or else you know not man and wife is one.</p>
<empty-line/>

If he be call'd a villain, what is she,</p>

<p>

Whose heart and love, and soul, is one with him?</p>

'Tis pity that so fair a gentleman</p>
<empty-line/>

Should fall into such villains' company.</p>

Meddle not with a villain or his wife.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

Where are my hopes? where your directions?</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

To come unto an honest wife, and call</p>
<empty-line/>

Her husband villain! were he[10] ne'er so bad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou might'st well think she would not brook that name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For her own credit, though no love to him.</p>

But leave not thus, but try some other mean;</p>
<empty-line/>

Let not one way thy hopes make frustrate clean.</p>

While Robin Glade and I went into <emphasis>campis</emphasis>;
And when I came again, my book was torn.</p>

A sweeter duck all London cannot yield;</p>

She cast a glance on me as I pass'd by,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not Helen had so ravishing an eye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here is the pedant Sir Aminadab;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will inquire of him if he can tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By any circumstance, whose wife she is:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such fellows commonly have intercourse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without suspicion, where we are debarr'd.</p>
<empty-line/>

God save you, gentle Sir Aminadab!</p>

Young Master Arthur; <emphasis>quid vis</emphasis>—what will you?</p>

<p>Y. ART. You are a man I much rely upon;</p>

There is a pretty wench dwells in this street</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That keeps no shop, nor is not public known:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At the two posts, next turning of the lane,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw her from a window looking out;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, could you tell me how to come acquainted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With that sweet lass, you should command me, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Even to the utmost of my life and power.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Dii boni, boni</emphasis>! 'tis my love he means;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I will keep it from this gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so, I hope, make trial of my love.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. If I obtain her, thou shalt win thereby</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More than at this time I will promise thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Quando venis aput</emphasis>, I shall have two horns on my <emphasis>caput</emphasis>.</p>

<p>

                                                      [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. What, if her husband come and find one there?</p>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Nuncquam time</emphasis>, never fear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She is unmarried, I swear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, if I help you to the deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Tu vis narrare</emphasis> how you speed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Tell how I speed? ay, sir, I will to you:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then presently about it. Many thanks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this great kindness, Sir Aminadab.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. If my <emphasis>puella</emphasis> prove a drab,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll be reveng'd on both: <emphasis>ambo</emphasis> shall die;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall die! by what? for <emphasis>ego</emphasis> I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have never handled, I thank God,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Other weapon than a rod;</p>

<p>    <emphasis>A Room in Justice Reason's House</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> JUSTICE REASON, OLD MASTER ARTHUR, OLD MASTER LUSAM,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    MISTRESS ARTHUR, YOUNG MASTER LUSAM, <emphasis>and</emphasis> HUGH.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. We, Master Justice Reason, come about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A serious matter that concerns us near.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, marry, doth it, sir, concern us near;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would God, sir, you would take some order for it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Why, look ye, Master Lusam, you are such another,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You will be talking what concerns us near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And know not why we come to Master Justice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. How? know not I?</p>
<p>O. ART. No, sir, not you.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Well, I know somewhat, though I know not that;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then on, I pray you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Forward, I pray, [and] yet the case is plain.</p>
<p>O. ART. Why, sir, as yet you do not know the case.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Well, he knows somewhat; forward, Master Arthur.</p>
<p>O. ART. And, as I told you, my unruly son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Once having bid his wife home to my house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There took occasion to be much aggriev'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

About some household matters of his own,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, in plain terms, they fell in controversy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. 'Tis true, sir, I was there the selfsame time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I remember many of the words.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Lord, what a man are you! you were not there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That time; as I remember, you were rid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Down to the North, to see some friends of yours.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Well, I was somewhere; forward, Master Arthur.</p>
<p>JUS. All this is well; no fault is to be found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In either of the parties; pray, say on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Why, sir, I have not nam'd the parties yet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor touch'd the fault that is complain'd upon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Well, you touch'd somewhat; forward, Master Arthur.</p>
<p>O. ART. And, as I said, they fell in controversy:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My son, not like a husband, gave her words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of great reproof, despite, and contumely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which she, poor soul, digested patiently;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This was the first time of their falling out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As I remember, at the selfsame time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One Thomas, the Earl of Surrey's gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Din'd at my table.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. I knew him well.</p>
<p>O. ART. You are the strangest man; this gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I speak of, I am sure you never saw;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He came but lately from beyond the sea.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. I am sure I know one Thomas;—forward, sir.</p>
<p>JUS. And is this all? Make me a <emphasis>mittimus</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And send the offender straightways to the jail.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. First know the offender—now[13] began the strife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betwixt this gentlewoman and my son—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since when, sir, he hath us'd her not like one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That should partake his bed, but like a slave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My coming was that you, being in office</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in authority, should call before you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My unthrift son, to give him some advice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which he will take better from you than me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That am his father. Here's the gentlewoman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wife to my son, and daughter to this man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom I perforce compell'd to live with us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. All this is well; here is your son, you say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But she that is his wife you cannot find.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. You do mistake, sir, here's the gentlewoman;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is her husband that will not be found.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Well, all is one, for man and wife are one;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But is this all?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. Ay, all that you can say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And much more than you can well put off.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Nay, if the case appear thus evident,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give me a cup of wine. What! man and wife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To disagree! I prythee, fill my cup;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I could say somewhat: tut, tut, by this wine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I promise you 'tis good canary sack.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Fathers, you do me open violence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bring my name in question, and produce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This gentleman and others here to witness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My husband's shame in open audience.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What may my husband think, when he shall know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I went unto the Justice to complain?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Master Justice here, more wise than you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Says little to the matter, knowing well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His office is no whit concern'd herein;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Therefore with favour I will take my leave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. The woman saith but reason, Master Arthur,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And therefore give her licence to depart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Here is dry justice, not to bid us drink!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hark thee, my friend, I prythee lend thy cup;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, Master Justice, hear me but one word;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You think this woman hath had little wrong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, by this wine which I intend to drink—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Nay, save your oath, I pray you do not swear;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or if you swear, take not too deep an oath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Content you, I may take a lawful oath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before a Justice; therefore, by this wine—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. A profound oath, well-sworn, and deeply took;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis better thus than swearing on a book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. My daughter hath been wronged exceedingly.</p>
<p>JUS. O, sir, I would have credited these words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without this oath: but bring your daughter hither,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I may give her counsel, ere you go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Marry, God's blessing on your heart for that!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Daughter, give ear to Justice Reason's words.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Good woman, or good wife, or mistress, if you have done amiss, it
should seem you have done a fault; and making a fault, there's no
question but you have done amiss: but if you walk uprightly, and
neither lead to the right hand nor the left, no question but you have
neither led to the right hand nor the left; but, as a man should say,
walked uprightly; but it should appear by these plaintiffs that you
have had some wrong: if you love your spouse entirely, it should seem
you affect him fervently; and if he hate you monstrously, it should
seem he loathes you most exceedingly, and there's the point at which I
will leave, for the time passes away: therefore, to conclude, this is
my best counsel: look that thy husband so fall in, that hereafter you
never fall out.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Good counsel, passing good instruction;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Follow it, daughter. Now, I promise you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have not heard such an oration</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This many a day. What remains to do?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. Sir, I was call'd as witness to this matter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I may be gone for aught that I can see.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Nay, stay, my friend, we must examine you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What can you say concerning this debate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betwixt young Master Arthur and his wife?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. Faith, just as much, I think, as you can say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that's just nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. How, nothing? Come, depose him; take his oath;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Swear him, I say; take his confession.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. What can you say, sir, in this doubtful case?</p>
<p>Y. LUS. Why, nothing, sir.</p>
<p>JUS. We cannot take him in contrary tales,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For he says nothing still, and that same nothing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is that which we have stood on all this while;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He hath confess'd even all, for all is nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This is your witness, he hath witness'd nothing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since nothing, then, so plainly is confess'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And we by cunning answers and by wit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have wrought him to confess nothing to us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Write his confession.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Why, what should we write?</p>
<p>JUS. Why, nothing: heard you not as well as I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What he confess'd? I say, write nothing down.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mistress, we have dismissed you; love your husband,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which, whilst you do, you shall not hate your husband.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bring him before me; I will urge him with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This gentleman's express confession</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against you; send him to me; I'll not fail</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To keep just nothing in my memory.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, sir, now that we have examin'd you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We likewise here discharge you with good leave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, Master Arthur and Master Lusam too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come in with me; unless the man were here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom most especially the cause concerns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We cannot end this quarrel: but come near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And we will taste a glass of our March beer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                   [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>SCENE III.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>A Room in Mistress Mary's House</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS MARY, MISTRESS SPLAY, <emphasis>and</emphasis> BRABO.</p>
<p>MRS MA. I prythee, tell me, Brabo, what planet, think'st thou, governed
at my conception, that I live thus openly to the world?</p>
<p>BRA. Two planets reign'd at once; Venus, that's you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Mars, that's I, were in conjunction.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. Prythee, prythee, in faith, that conjunction copulative is
that part of speech that I live by.</p>
<p>BRA. Ha, ha! to see the world! we swaggerers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That live by oaths and big-mouth'd menaces,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are now reputed for the tallest men:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that hath now a black moustachio,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Reaching from ear to ear, or turning up,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Puncto reverso</emphasis>, bristling towards the eye;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that can hang two handsome tools at his side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go in disguis'd attire, wear iron enough,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is held a tall man and a soldier.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that with greatest grace can swear Gog's-zounds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or in a tavern make a drunken fray,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can cheat at dice, swagger in bawdy-houses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wear velvet on his face, and with a grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can face it out with,—As I am a soldier!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that can clap his sword upon the board,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He's a brave man—and such a man am I.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. She that with kisses can both kill and cure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That lives by love, that swears by nothing else</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But by a kiss, which is no common oath;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That lives by lying, and yet oft tells truth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That takes most pleasure when she takes most pains;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She's a good wench, my boy, and so am I.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. She that is past it, and prays for them that may—</p>
<p>BRA. Is an old bawd, as you are, Mistress Splay.</p>
<p>MRS SPLAY. O, do not name that name; do you not know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I could ne'er endure to hear that name?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, if your man would leave us, I would read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The lesson that last night I promis'd you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. I prythee, leave us, we would be alone.</p>
<p>BRA. And will, and must: if you bid me begone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will withdraw, and draw on any he,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That in the world's wide round dare cope with me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mistress, farewell! to none I never speak</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So kind a word. My salutations are,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farewell, and be hang'd! or, in the devil's name!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What they have been, my many frays can tell;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You cannot fight; therefore to you, farewell!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                           [Exit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. O, this same swaggerer is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The bulwark of my reputation; but,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mistress Splay, now to your lecture that you promised me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. Daughter, attend, for I will tell thee now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, in my young days, I myself have tried;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be rul'd by me, and I will make thee rich.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You, God be prais'd, are fair, and, as they say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Full of good parts; you have been often tried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be a woman of good carriage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which, in my mind, is very commendable.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. It is indeed; forward, good Mother Splay.</p>
<p>MRS SPLAY. And, as I told you, being fair, I wish,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet daughter, you were as fortunate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When any suitor comes to ask thy love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Look not into his words, but into his sleeve;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If thou canst learn what language his purse speaks,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be ruled by that; that's golden eloquence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Money can make a slavering tongue speak plain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If he that loves thee be deform'd and rich,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Accept his love: gold hides deformity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gold can make limping Vulcan walk upright;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make squint eyes straight, a crabbed face look smooth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gilds copper noses, makes them look like gold;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fills age's wrinkles up, and makes a face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As old as Nestor's, look as young as Cupid's.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If thou wilt arm thyself against all shifts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Regard all men according to their gifts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This if thou practise, thou, when I am dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wilt say: Old Mother Splay, soft lie[14] thy head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> YOUNG MASTER ARTHUR.</p>
<p>MRS MA. Soft, who comes here? begone, good Mistress Splay;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of thy rule's practice this is my first day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. God, for thy passion, what a beast am I
To scare the bird, that to the net would fly!
                                            [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Y. ART. By your leave, mistress.</p>
<p>MRS MA. What to do, master?</p>
<p>Y. ART. To give me leave to love you.</p>
<p>MRS MA. I had rather afford you some love to leave me.</p>
<p>Y. ART. I would you would as soon love me, as I could leave you.</p>
<p>MRS MA. I pray you, what are you, sir?</p>
<p>Y. ART. A man, I'll assure you.</p>
<p>MRS MA. How should I know that?</p>
<p>Y. ART. Try me, by my word, for I say I am a man;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or by my deed I'll prove myself a man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Are you not Master Arthur?</p>
<p>Y. ART. Not Master Arthur, but Arthur, and your servant,
sweet Mistress Mary.</p>
<p>MRS MA. Not Mistress Mary, but Mary, and your handmaid,
sweet Master Arthur.</p>
<p>Y. ART. That I love you, let my face tell you; that I love you more
than ordinarily, let this kiss testify; and that I love you fervently
and entirely, ask this gift, and see what it will answer you, myself,
my purse, and all, being wholly at your service.</p>
<p>MRS MA. That I take your love in good part, my thanks shall speak for
me; that I am pleased with your kiss, this interest of another shall
certify you; and that I accept your gift, my prostrate service and
myself shall witness with me. My love, my lips, and sweet self, are at
your service: wilt please you to come near, sir?</p>
<p>Y. ART. O, that my wife were dead! here would I make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My second choice: would she were buried!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From out her grave this marrigold should grow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which, in my nuptials, I would wear with pride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Die shall she, I have doom'd her destiny.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. 'Tis news, Master Arthur, to see you in such a place:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How doth your wife?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Faith, Mistress Mary, at the point of death,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And long she cannot live; she shall not live</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To trouble me in this my second choice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> AMINADAB <emphasis>with a bill and headpiece</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MRS MA. I pray forbear, sir, for here comes my love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good sir, for this time leave me; by this kiss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You cannot ask the question at my hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will deny you: pray you, get you gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Farewell, sweet Mistress Mary!    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MRS MA. Sweet, adieu!</p>
<p>AMIN. Stand to me, bill! and, headpiece, sit thou close!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hear my love, my wench, my duck, my dear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is sought by many suitors; but with this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll keep the door, and enter he that dare!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Virga, be gone, thy twigs I'll turn to steel;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These fingers, that were expert in the jerk;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Instead of lashing of the trembling <emphasis>podex</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Must learn pash and knock, and beat and mall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cleave pates and <emphasis>caputs</emphasis>; he that enters here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Comes on to his death! <emphasis>mors mortis</emphasis> he shall taste.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                 [<emphasis>He hides himself</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Alas! poor fool, the pedant's mad for love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thinks me more mad that I would marry him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He's come to watch me with a rusty bill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To keep my friends away by force of arms:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not see him, but stand still aside,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And here observe him what he means to do.    [<emphasis>Retires</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>O utinam</emphasis>, that he that loves her best,</p>

<p>

<emphasis>Per Jovem et Junonem! hoc</emphasis></p>

<p>

As that his soul his course shall take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Limbo and Avernus' lake.</p>
<empty-line/>

In vain I watch in this dark hole;</p>

<p>

Would any living durst my manhood try,</p>
<empty-line/>

And offer to come up the stairs this way!</p>
<empty-line/>

A bar of iron, 'gainst which to try my sword?</p>

Now, by my beard, a dainty piece of steel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. O Jove, what a qualm is this I feel!</p>
<p>BRA. Come hither, Mall, is none here but we two?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When didst thou see the starveling schoolmaster?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That rat, that shrimp, that spindle-shank,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That wren, that sheep-biter, that lean chitty-face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That famine, that lean envy, that all-bones,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That bare anatomy, that Jack-a-Lent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That ghost, that shadow, that moon in the wane?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. I wail in woe, I plunge in pain.[15]    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>BRA. When next I find him here, I'll hang him up,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a dried sausage, in the chimney's top:</p>

That stock-fish, that poor John, that gut of men!</p>

I had kept my Mistress Virga still,</p>

And he upon another's back,</p>
<empty-line/>

His points untruss'd, his breeches slack;</p>

My countenance he should not dash,</p>

But my sweet lass my love doth fly,</p>

<p>

Which shall make me by poison die.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>A Room in Young Arthur's House</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR <emphasis>and</emphasis> PIPKIN.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Sirrah! when saw you your master?</p>
<p>PIP. Faith, mistress, when I last look'd upon him.</p>
<p>MRS ART. And when was that?</p>
<p>PIP. When I beheld him.</p>
<p>MRS ART. And when was that?</p>
<p>PIP. Marry, when he was in my sight, and that was yesterday; since when
I saw not my master, nor looked on my master, nor beheld my master, nor
had any sight of my master.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Was he not at my father-in-law's?</p>
<p>PIP. Yes, marry, was he.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Didst thou not entreat him to come home?</p>
<p>PIP. How should I, mistress? he came not there to-day.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Didst thou not say he was there?</p>
<p>PIP. True, mistress, he was there? but I did not tell ye when; he hath
been there divers times, but not of late.</p>
<p>MRS ART. About your business! here I'll sit and wait</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His coming home, though it be ne'er so late.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now once again go look him at the 'Change,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or at the church with Sir Aminadab.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis told me they use often conference;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When that is done, get you to school again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. I had rather play the truant at home, than go seek my master at
school: let me see, what age am I? some four and twenty, and how have
I profited? I was five years learning to crish cross[16] from great A,
and five years longer coming to F; there I stuck some three years,
before I could come to Q; and so, in process of time, I came to e per
se e, and com per se, and tittle; then I got to a, e, i, o, u; after,
to Our Father; and, in the sixteenth year of my age, and the fifteenth
of my going to school,
I am in good time gotten to a noun,
By the same token there my hose went down;
Then I got to a verb,
There I began first to have a beard;
Then I came to <emphasis>iste, ista, istud</emphasis>,
There my master whipped me till he fetched the blood,
And so forth: so that now I am become the greatest scholar in the
school, for I am bigger than two or three of them. But I am gone;
farewell, mistress!</p>

<p>FUL. Love none at all! They will forswear themselves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when you urge them with it, their replies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are, that Jove laughs at lovers' perjuries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. You told me of a jest concerning that;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I prythee, let me hear it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. That thou shalt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My mistress in a humour had protested,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That above all the world she lov'd me best;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Saying with suitors she was oft molested,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she had lodg'd her heart within my breast;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sware (but me), both by her mask and fan,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She never would so much as name a man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not name a man? quoth I; yet be advis'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not love a man but me! let it be so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You shall not think, quoth she, my thought's disguis'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In flattering language or dissembling show;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I say again, and I know what I do,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not name a man alive but you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into her house I came at unaware,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her back was to me, and I was not seen;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I stole behind her, till I had her fair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then with my hands I closed both her een;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She, blinded thus, beginneth to bethink her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which of her loves it was that did hoodwink her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

First she begins to guess and name a man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I well knew, but she had known far better;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The next I never did suspect till then:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Still of my name I could not hear a letter;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then mad, she did name Robin, and then James,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till she had reckon'd up some twenty names;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At length, when she had counted up a score,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As one among the rest, she hit on me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I ask'd her if she could not reckon more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pluck'd away my hands to let her see;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, when she look'd back, and saw me behind her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She blush'd, and ask'd if it were I did blind her?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And since I sware, both by her mask and fan,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To trust no she-tongue, that can name a man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Your great oath hath some exceptions:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But to our former purpose; yon is Mistress Arthur;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We will attempt another kind of wooing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make her hate her husband, if we can.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. But not a word of passion or of love;</p>
<empty-line/>

Have at her now to try her patience.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR.</p>
<p>God save you, mistress!</p>
<p>MRS ART. You are welcome, sir.</p>
<p>FUL. I pray you, where's your husband?</p>
<p>MRS ART. Not within.</p>
<p>ANS. Who, Master Arthur? him I saw even now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At Mistress Mary's, the brave courtesan's.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Wrong not my husband's reputation so;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I neither can nor will believe you, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Poor gentlewoman! how much I pity you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your husband is become her only guest:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He lodges there, and daily diets there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He riots, revels, and doth all things;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, he is held the Master of Misrule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Mongst a most loathed and abhorred crew:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And can you, being a woman, suffer this?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Sir, sir! I understand you well enough:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Admit, my husband doth frequent that house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of such dishonest usage; I suppose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He doth it but in zeal to bring them home</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By his good counsel from that course of sin;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, like a Christian, seeing them astray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In the broad path that to damnation leads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He useth thither to direct their feet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into the narrow way that guides to heaven.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Was ever woman gull'd so palpably!    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, Mistress Arthur, think you as you say?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Sir, what I think, I think, and what I say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would I could enjoin you to believe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Faith, Mistress Arthur, I am sorry for you:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, in good sooth, I wish it lay in me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To remedy the least part of these wrongs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your unkind husband daily proffers you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. You are deceived, he is not unkind:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Although he bear an outward face of hate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His heart and soul are both assured mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Fie, Mistress Arthur! take a better spirit;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be not so timorous to rehearse your wrongs:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I say, your husband haunts bad company,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Swaggerers, cheaters, wanton courtesans;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There he defiles his body, stains his soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Consumes his wealth, undoes himself and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In danger of diseases, whose vile names</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are not for any honest mouths to speak,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor any chaste ears to receive and hear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, he will bring that face, admir'd for beauty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be more loathed than a lep'rous skin!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Divorce yourself, now whilst the clouds grow black;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prepare yourself a shelter for the storm;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Abandon his most loathed fellowship:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are young, mistress; will you lose your youth?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Tempt no more, devil! thy deformity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath chang'd itself into an angel's shape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But yet I know thee by thy course of speech:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou gett'st an apple to betray poor Eve,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose outside bears a show of pleasant fruit;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But the vile branch, on which this apple grew,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was that which drew poor Eve from paradise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy Syren's song could make me drown myself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I am tied unto the mast of truth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Admit, my husband be inclin'd to vice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My virtues may in time recall him home;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, if we both should desp'rate run to sin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We should abide certain destruction.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But he's like one, that over a sweet face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Puts a deformed vizard; for his soul</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is free from any such intents of ill:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Only to try my patience he puts on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An ugly shape of black intemperance;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Therefore, this blot of shame which he now wears,</p>
<empty-line/>

I with my prayers will purge, wash with my tears.</p>

The juice of mandrake, by a doctor made</p>

My sweet <emphasis>magister</emphasis>, not a word;</p>

I'll neither drown me in a ford,</p>
<empty-line/>

Nor give my neck such a scope,</p>

T'embrace it with a hempen rope;</p>

I'll die no way, till nature will me,</p>

If what is pass'd you will conceal,</p>

And nothing to the world reveal;</p>

Nay, as Quintillian said of yore,</p>
<empty-line/>

I'll strive to kill myself no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. On that condition I'll conceal this deed:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To-morrow, pray, come and dine with me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I have many strangers; 'mongst the rest,</p>
<empty-line/>

Some are desirous of your company.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You will not fail me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. No, in sooth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll try the sharpness of my tooth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Instead of poison, I will eat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rabbits, capons, and such meat;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so, as Pythagoras says,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With wholesome fare prolong my days.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, sir, will Mistress Mall be there?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. She shall, she shall; man, never fear.</p>
<p>AMIN. Then my spirit becomes stronger,</p>

And I will live and stretch longer;</p>

For Ovid said, and did not lie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That poison'd men do often die:</p>
<empty-line/>

But poison henceforth I'll not eat,</p>

Whilst I can other victuals get.</p>

Be sure, sir, I will be your guest.</p>

But keep my counsel, <emphasis>vale tu</emphasis>!</p>

And, till to-morrow, sir, adieu!</p>

At your table I will prove,</p>

If I can eat away my love.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Y. ART. O, I am glad I have thee; now devise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A way how to bestow it cunningly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It shall be thus: to-morrow I'll pretend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A reconcilement 'twixt my wife and me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to that end I will invite thus many—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

First Justice Reason, as the chief man there;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father Arthur, old Lusam, young Lusam.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Master Fuller and Master Anselm I have bid already;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then will I have my lovely Mary too,</p>
<empty-line/>

Be it but to spite my wife, before she die;</p>

For die she shall before to-morrow night.</p>

The operation of this poison is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not suddenly to kill; they that take it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fall in a sleep, and then 'tis past recure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this will I put in her cup to-morrow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> PIPKIN, <emphasis>running</emphasis>.</p>
<p>PIP. This 'tis to have such a master! I have sought him at the 'Change,
at the school, at every place, but I cannot find him nowhere.
                                             [<emphasis>Sees</emphasis> M. ART.]
O, cry mercy! my mistress would entreat you to come home.</p>
<p>Y. ART. I cannot come to-night; some urgent business</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will all this night employ me otherwise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. I believe my mistress would con you as much thank to do that
business at home as abroad.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Here, take my purse, and bid my wife provide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good cheer against to-morrow; there will be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two or three strangers of my late acquaintance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sirrah, go you to Justice Reason's house;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Invite him first with all solemnity;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go to my father's and my father-in-law's;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here, take this note—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The rest that come I will invite myself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

About it with what quick despatch thou can'st.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. I warrant you, master, I'll despatch this business with more
honesty than you'll despatch yours. But, master, will the gentlewoman
be there?</p>
<p>Y. ART. What gentlewoman?</p>
<p>PIP. The gentlewoman of the old house, that is as well known by the
colour she lays on her cheeks, as an alehouse by the painting is laid
on his lattice; she that is, like <emphasis>homo</emphasis>, common to all men; she that
is beholden to no trade, but lives of herself.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Sirrah, begone, or I will send you hence.</p>
<p>PIP. I'll go [<emphasis>aside</emphasis>]; but, by this hand, I'll tell my mistress as
soon as I come home that mistress light-heels comes to dinner
to-morrow.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Sweet Mistress Mary, I'll invite myself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And there I'll frolic, sup, and spend the night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My plot is current; here 'tis in my hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will make me happy in my second choice:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I may freely challenge as mine own,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What I am now enforc'd to seek by stealth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Love is not much unlike ambition;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For in them both all lets must be remov'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twixt every crown and him that would aspire;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he that will attempt to win the same</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Must plunge up to the depth o'er head and ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hazard drowning in that purple sea:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So he that loves must needs through blood and fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And do all things to compass his desire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                           [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

<p>SCENE III.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>A Room in Young Arthur's House</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR <emphasis>and her</emphasis> MAID.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Come, spread the table; is the hall well rubb'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The cushions in the windows neatly laid?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The cupboard of plate set out? the casements stuck</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With rosemary and flowers? the carpets brush'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MAID. Ay, forsooth, mistress.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Look to the kitchen-maid, and bid the cook take down the
oven-stone, [lest] the pies be burned: here, take my keys, and give
him out more spice.</p>
<p>MAID. Yes, forsooth, mistress.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Where's that knave Pipkin? bid him spread the cloth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fetch the clean diaper napkins from my chest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Set out the gilded salt, and bid the fellow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make himself handsome, get him a clean band.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MAID. Indeed, forsooth, mistress, he is such a sloven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That nothing will sit handsome about him;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He had a pound of soap to scour his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet his brow looks like the chimney-stock.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. He'll be a sloven still; maid, take this apron,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bring me one of linen: quickly, maid.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MAID. I go, forsooth.</p>
<p>MRS ART. There was a curtsy! let me see't again;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ay, that was well.—[<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> MAID.] I fear my guests will come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ere we be ready. What a spite is this.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Within</emphasis>. Mistress!</p>
<p>MRS ART. What's the matter?</p>
<p><emphasis>Within</emphasis>. Mistress, I pray, take Pipkin from the fire;
We cannot keep his fingers from the roast.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Bid him come hither; what a knave is that!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fie, fie, never out of the kitchen!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Still broiling by the fire!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> PIPKIN.</p>
<p>PIP. I hope you will not take Pipkin from the fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till the broth be enough.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MAID, <emphasis>with an apron</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Well, sirrah, get a napkin and a trencher,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wait to-day. So, let me see: my apron.    [<emphasis>Puts it on</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. Mistress, I can tell ye one thing, my master's wench</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will come home to-day to dinner.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> JUSTICE REASON, <emphasis>and his man</emphasis> HUGH.</p>
<p>MRS ART. She shall be welcome, if she be his guest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But here's some of our guests are come already:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A chair for Justice Reason, sirrah!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Good morrow, Mistress Arthur! you are like a good housewife:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At your request I am come home. What, a chair!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus age seeks ease. Where is your husband, mistress?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, a cushion, too!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. I pray you, ease your tail, sir.</p>
<p>JUS. Marry, and will, good fellow; twenty thanks.</p>
<p>            [HUGH <emphasis>and</emphasis> PIPKIN <emphasis>converse apart</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>PIP. Master Hugh, as welcome as heart can tell, or tongue can think.</p>
<p>HUGH. I thank you, Master Pipkin; I have got many a good dish of broth
by your means.</p>
<p>PIP. According to the ancient courtesy, you are welcome; according to
the time and place, you are heartily welcome: when they are busied at
the board, we will find ourselves busied in the buttery; and so, sweet
Hugh, according to our scholars' phrase, <emphasis>gratulor adventum tuum</emphasis>.</p>
<p>HUGH. I will answer you with the like, sweet Pipkin, <emphasis>gratias</emphasis>.</p>
<p>PIP. As much grace as you will, but as little of it as you can,
good Hugh. But here comes more guests.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> OLD MASTER ARTHUR <emphasis>and</emphasis> OLD MASTER LUSAM.</p>
<p>MRS ART. More stools and cushions for these gentlemen.</p>
<p>O. ART. What, Master Justice Reason, are you here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who would have thought to have met you in this place?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. What say mine eyes, is Justice Reason here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mountains may meet, and so, I see, may we.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Well, when men meet, they meet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when they part, they oft leave one another's company;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So we, being met, are met.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Truly, you say true;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Master Justice Reason speaks but reason:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hear how wisely men of law will speak!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> ANSELM <emphasis>and</emphasis> FULLER.</p>
<p>ANS. Good morrow, gentlemen!</p>
<p>MRS ART. What? are you there?</p>
<p>ANS. Good morrow, mistress, and good morrow, all!</p>
<p>JUS. If I may be so bold in a strange place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I say, good morrow, and as much to you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I pray, gentlemen, will you sit down?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have been young, like you; and, if you live</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto our age, you will be old like us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Be rul'd by reason; but who's here?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> AMINADAB.</p>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Salvete, omnes</emphasis>! and good day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all at once, as I may say;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

First, Master Justice; next, Old Arthur,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That gives me pension by the quarter;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To my good mistress and the rest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That are the founders of this feast;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In brief, I speak to <emphasis>omnes</emphasis>, all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That to their meat intend to fall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Welcome, Sir Aminadab; O, my son</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath profited exceeding well with you:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sit down, sit down, by Mistress Arthur's leave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> YOUNG MASTER ARTHUR, YOUNG MASTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    LUSAM, <emphasis>and</emphasis> MISTRESS MARY.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Gentlemen, welcome all; whilst I deliver</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their private welcomes, wife, be it your charge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To give this gentlewoman entertainment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Husband, I will. O, this is she usurps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The precious interest of my husband's love;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though, as I am a woman, I could well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thrust such a lewd companion out of doors;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet, as I am a true, obedient, wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'd kiss her feet to do my husband's will.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are entirely welcome, gentlewoman;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Indeed you are; pray, do not doubt of it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. I thank you, Mistress Arthur; now, by my little honesty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It much repents me to wrong so chaste a woman.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Gentles, put o'er your legs; first, Master Justice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here you shall sit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. And here shall Mistress Mary sit by me.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Pardon me, sir, she shall have my wife's place.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Indeed, you shall, for he will have it so.</p>
<p>MRS MA. If you will needs; but I shall do you wrong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To take your place.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, by my faith, you should.</p>
<p>MRS ART. That is no wrong, which we impute no wrong!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I pray you, sit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Gentlemen all, I pray you, seat yourselves:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, Sir Aminadab, I know where your heart is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                                       [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

AMIN. Mum, not a word, <emphasis>pax vobis</emphasis>, peace:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, gentles, I'll be of this mess.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. So, who gives thanks?</p>
<p>AMIN. Sir, that will I.</p>
<p>Y. ART. I pray you to it by and by.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where's Pipkin?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wait at the board; let Master Season's man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be had into the buttery; but first give him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A napkin and a trencher. Well-said. Hugh,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wait at your master's elbow: now say grace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Gloria Deo</emphasis>, sirs, proface;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Attend me now, whilst I say grace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For bread and salt, for grapes and malt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For flesh and fish, and every dish;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mutton and beef, of all meats chief;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For cow-heels, chitterlings, tripes and souse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And other meat that's in the house;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For racks, for breasts, for legs, for loins,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For pies with raisins and with proins,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For fritters, pancakes, and for fries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For ven'son pasties and minc'd pies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sheeps'-head and garlic, brawn and mustard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wafers, spic'd cakes, tart, and custard;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For capons, rabbits, pigs, and geese,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For apples, caraways, and cheese;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For all these and many mo:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Benedicamus Domino</emphasis>!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL. Amen.</p>
<p>JUS. I con you thanks; but, Sir Aminadab,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is that your scholar! now, I promise you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is a toward stripling of his age.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. Who? I, forsooth? yes, indeed, forsooth, I am his scholar. I would
you should well think I have profited under him too; you shall hear, if
he will pose me.</p>
<p>O. ART. I pray you, let's hear him.</p>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Huc ades</emphasis>, Pipkin.</p>
<p>PIP. <emphasis>Adsum</emphasis>.</p>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Quot casus sunt</emphasis>? how many cases are there?</p>
<p>PIP. Marry, a great many.</p>
<p>AMIN. Well-answer'd, a great many: there are six,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Six, a great many; 'tis well-answer'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And which be they?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. A bow-case, a cap-case, a comb-case, a lute-case, a fiddle-case,
and a candle-case.</p>
<p>JUS. I know them all; again, well-answer'd:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pray God, my youngest son profit no worse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. How many parsons are there?</p>
<p>PIP. I'll tell you as many as I know, if you'll give me leave to reckon
them.</p>
<p>ANS. I prythee, do.</p>
<p>PIP. The parson of Fenchurch, the parson of Pancras, and the parson
of———</p>
<p>Y. ART. Well, sir, about your business:—now will I
Temper the cup my loathed wife shall drink
                                 [<emphasis>Aside, and exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>O. ART. Daughter, methinks you are exceeding sad.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Faith, daughter, so thou art exceeding sad.</p>
<p>MRS ART. 'Tis but my countenance, for my heart is merry:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mistress, were you as merry as you are welcome,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You should not sit so sadly as you do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. 'Tis but because I am seated in your place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which is frequented seldom with true mirth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. The fault is neither in the place nor me.</p>
<p>AMIN. How say you, lady?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him you last did lie by!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All this is no more, <emphasis>praebibo tibi</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. I thank you, sir. Mistress, this draught shall be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him that loves both you and me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. I know your meaning.</p>
<p>ANS. Now to me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If she have either love or charity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Here, Master Justice, this to your grave years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A mournful draught, God wot: half-wine, half-tears.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Let come, my wench; here, youngsters, to you all!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are silent: here's that will make you talk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wenches, methink you sit like puritans:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Never a jest abroad to make them laugh?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Sir, since you move speech of a puritan,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you will give me audience, I will tell ye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As good a jest as ever you did hear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. A jest? that's excellent!</p>
<p>JUS. Beforehand, let's prepare ourselves to laugh;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A jest is nothing, if it be not grac'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, now, I pray you, when begins this jest?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. I came unto a puritan, to woo her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And roughly did salute her with a kiss:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away! quoth she, and rudely push'd me from her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Brother, by yea and nay, I like not this:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And still with amorous talk she was saluted,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My artless speech with Scripture was confuted.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Good, good, indeed; the best that e'er I heard.</p>
<p>O. ART. I promise you, it was exceeding good.</p>
<p>FUL. Oft I frequented her abode by night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And courted her, and spake her wond'rous fair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But ever somewhat did offend her sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Either my double ruff or my long hair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My scarf was vain, my garments hung too low,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My Spanish shoe was cut too broad at toe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL. Ha, ha! the best that ever I heard!</p>
<p>FUL. I parted for that time, and came again,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Seeming to be conform'd in look and speech;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My shoes were sharp-toed, and my band was plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Close to my thigh my metamorphos'd breech;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My cloak was narrow-cap'd, my hair cut shorter;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Off went my scarf, thus march'd I to the porter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL. Ha, ha! was ever heard the like?</p>
<p>FUL. The porter, spying me, did lead me in,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where his fair mistress sat reading of a chapter;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Peace to this house, quoth I, and those within,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which holy speech with admiration wrapp'd her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ever as I spake, and came her nigh,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Seeming divine, turn'd up the white of eye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. So, so, what then?</p>
<p>O. LUS. Forward, I pray, forward, sir.</p>
<p>FUL. I spake divinely, and I call'd her sister,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And by this means we were acquainted well:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By yea and nay, I will, quoth I, and kiss'd her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She blush'd, and said, that long-tongu'd men would tell;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I swore[18] to be as secret as the night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And said, on sooth, I would put out the light.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. In sooth he would! a passing-passing jest.</p>
<p>FUL. O, do not swear, quoth she, yet put it out,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because I would not have you break your oath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I felt a bed there, as I grop'd about;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In troth, quoth I, here will we rest us both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Swear you, in troth, quoth she? had you not sworn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I had not done't, but took it in full scorn:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then you will come, quoth I? though I be loth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll come, quoth she, be't but to keep your oath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. 'Tis very pretty; but now, when's the jest?</p>
<p>O. ART. O, forward, to the jest in any case.</p>
<p>O. LUS. I would not, for an angel, lose the jest.</p>
<p>FUL. Here's right the dunghill cock that finds a pearl.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To talk of wit to these, is as a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should cast out jewels to a herd of swine—[<emphasis>aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, in the last words did consist the jest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, in the last words? ha, ha, ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It was an excellent admired jest—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To them that understood it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> YOUNG MASTER ARTHUR, <emphasis>with two cups of wine</emphasis>.</p>
<p>JUS. It was, indeed; I must, for fashion's sake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Say as they say; but otherwise, O, God!    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good Master Arthur, thanks for our good cheer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Gentlemen, welcome all; now hear me speak—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One special cause that mov'd me lead you hither,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is for an ancient grudge that hath long since</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Continued 'twixt my modest wife and me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The wrongs that I have done her I recant.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In either hand I hold a sev'ral cup,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This in the right hand, wife, I drink to thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This in the left hand, pledge me in this draught,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Burying all former hatred; so, have to thee.    [<emphasis>He drinks</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. The welcom'st pledge that yet I ever took:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were this wine poison, or did taste like gall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The honey-sweet condition of your draught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would make it drink like nectar: I will pledge you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were it the last that I should ever drink.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Make that account: thus, gentlemen, you see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our late discord brought to a unity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Ecce, quam bonum et quam jucundum</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Est habitare fratres in unum</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. My heart doth taste the sweetness of your pledge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I am glad to see this sweet accord.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Glad, quotha? there's not one among'st us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But may be exceeding glad.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. I am, ay, marry, am I, that I am.</p>
<p>Y. LUS. The best accord that could betide their loves.</p>
<p>ANS. The worst accord that could betide my love.</p>
<p>                                 [<emphasis>All about to rise</emphasis>.</p>
<p>AMIN: What, rising, gentles? keep your place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will close up your stomachs with a grace;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>O Domine et care Pater</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That giv'st us wine instead of water;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the pond and river clear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mak'st nappy ale and good March beer;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That send'st us sundry sorts of meat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And everything we drink or eat;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To maids, to wives, to boys, to men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Laus Deo Sancto</emphasis>, Amen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. So, much good do ye all, and, gentlemen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Accept your welcomes better than your cheer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Nay, so we do, I'll give you thanks for all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Master Justice, you do walk our way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Master Arthur, and old Hugh your man;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'll be the first [that] will strain courtesy.</p>

<p>JUS. God be with you all!</p>
<p>       [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> O. ART., O. LUS., <emphasis>and</emphasis> JUS. REASON.</p>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Proximus ego sum</emphasis>, I'll be the next,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And man you home; how say you, lady?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I pray you do, good Sir Aminadab.</p>
<p>MRS MA. Sir, if it be not too much trouble to you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me entreat that kindness at your hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. Entreat! fie! no, sweet lass, command;
<emphasis>Sic</emphasis>, so, <emphasis>nunc</emphasis>, now, take the upper hand.</p>
<p>               [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> MRS MARY <emphasis>escorted by</emphasis> AMINADAB.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Come, wife, this meeting was all for our sakes:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I long to see the force my poison takes.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. My dear-dear husband, in exchange of hate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My love and heart shall on your service wait.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>             [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> Y. ART., MRS ART., <emphasis>and</emphasis> PIPKIN.</p>
<p>ANS. So doth my love on thee; but long no more;</p>

To her rich love thy service is too poor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. For shame, no more! you had best expostulate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your love with every stranger; leave these sighs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And change them to familiar conference.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. LUS. Trust me, the virtues of young Arthur's wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her constancy, modest humility,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her patience, and admired temperance,</p>
<empty-line/>

Have made me love all womankind the better.</p>

<p>PIP. Out of my way! stand back, I say!</p>
<empty-line/>

All joy from earth has fled!</p>

My mistress she is dead!</p>

O Lord, my mistress! my mistress!    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

And the world's wonder from the world quite banish'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, I am sick, my pain grows worse and worse;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am quite struck through with this late discourse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. What! faint'st thou, man? I'll lead thee hence; for shame!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Swoon at the tidings of a woman's death!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Intolerable, and beyond all thought!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, my love's fool, give me thy hand to lead;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This day one body and two hearts are dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                   [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> ANSELM <emphasis>and</emphasis> FULLER.</p>
<p>Y. LUS. But now she was as well as well might be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on the sudden dead; joy in excess</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath overrun her poor disturbed soul.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll after, and see how Master Arthur takes it;</p>
<empty-line/>

His former hate far more suspicious makes it.</p>

Hugh, I must needs beat thee; I am mad!</p>

<p>JUS. Mistress Arthur! Here comes her husband.</p>
<p>Y. ART. O, here the woful'st husband comes alive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No husband now; the wight, that did uphold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That name of husband, is now quite o'erthrown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I am left a hapless widower.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Fain would I speak, if grief would suffer me.</p>
<p>O. LUS. As Master Arthur says, so say I;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If grief would let me, I would weeping die.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be thus hapless in my aged years!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, I would speak; but my words melt to tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Go in, go in, and view the sweetest corpse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That e'er was laid upon a mournful room;</p>

You cannot speak for weeping sorrow's doom:</p>

Bad news are rife, good tidings seldom come.</p>

<p>ANS. What frantic humour doth thus haunt my sense,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Striving to breed destruction in my spirit?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I would sleep, the ghost of my sweet love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Appears unto me in an angel's shape:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I'm awake, my fantasy presents,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As in a glass, the shadow of my love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I would speak, her name intrudes itself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into the perfect echoes of my speech:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And though my thought beget some other word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet will my tongue speak nothing but her name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I do meditate, it is on her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If dream of her, or if discourse of her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I think her ghost doth haunt me, as in times</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of former darkness old wives' tales report.</p>

<p>Here comes my better genius, whose advice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Directs me still in all my actions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How now, from whence come you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Faith, from the street, in which, as I pass'd by,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I met the modest Mistress Arthur's corpse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And after her as mourners, first her husband,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Next Justice Reason, then old Master Arthur,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Old Master Lusam, and young Lusam too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With many other kinsfolks, neighbours, friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And others, that lament her funeral:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her body is by this laid in the vault.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. And in that vault my body I will lay!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I prythee, leave me: thither is my way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. I am sure you jest, you mean not as you say.</p>
<p>ANS. No, no, I'll but go to the church, and pray.</p>
<p>FUL. Nay, then we shall be troubled with your humour.</p>
<p>ANS. As ever thou didst love me, or as ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou didst delight in my society,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By all the rights of friendship and of love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me entreat thy absence but one hour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And at the hour's end I will come to thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Nay, if you will be foolish, and past reason,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll wash my hands, like Pilate, from thy folly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And suffer thee in these extremities.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Now it is night, and the bright lamps of heaven</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are half-burn'd out: now bright Adelbora</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Welcomes the cheerful day-star to the east,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And harmless stillness hath possess'd the world:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This is the church,—this hollow is the vault,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where the dead body of my saint remains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this the coffin that enshrines her body,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For her bright soul is now in paradise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My coming is with no intent of sin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or to defile the body of the dead;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But rather take my last farewell of her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or languishing and dying by her side,</p>
<empty-line/>

My airy soul post after hers to heaven.</p>
<empty-line/>

First, with this latest kiss I seal my love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her lips are warm, and I am much deceiv'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If that she stir not. O, this Golgotha,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This place of dead men's bones is terrible,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Presenting fearful apparitions!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is some spirit that in the coffin lies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And makes my hair start up on end with fear!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come to thyself, faint heart—she sits upright!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, I would hide me, but I know not where.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tush, if it be a spirit, 'tis a good spirit;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For with her body living ill she knew not;</p>

And with her body dead ill cannot meddle.</p>

<p>

And by her language now I know she lives.</p>

<p>MRS ART. O, who can tell me where I am become?</p>

For in this darkness I have lost myself;</p>

I am not dead, for I have sense and life:</p>

How come I then in this coffin buried?</p>

Hath train'd thee hither to redeem her life.</p>

<p>ANS. O yes, a man, whose heart till now was dead,</p>

Lives and survives at your return to life:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, start not; I am Anselm, one who long</p>

Hath doted on your fair perfection,</p>
<empty-line/>

And, loving you more than became me well,</p>

Was hither sent by some strange providence,</p>

To bring you from these hollow vaults below,</p>

To be a liver in the world again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. I understand you, and I thank the heavens,</p>
<empty-line/>

Or that he did attempt to poison me,</p>

Or that he laid me here, and I was dead;</p>

The world, your husband, and your friends suppose</p>

That you are dead, grant me but one request,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will swear never to solicit more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your sacred thoughts to my dishonest love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. So your demand may be no prejudice</p>

To my chaste name, no wrong unto my husband,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No suit that may concern my wedlock's breach,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I yield unto it; but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To pass the bounds of modesty and chastity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sooner[19] will I bequeath myself again</p>

Unto this grave, and never part from hence,</p>

Than taint my soul with black impurity.</p>

This my request is—since your husband dotes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon a lewd, lascivious courtesan—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since he hath broke the bonds of your chaste bed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, like a murd'rer, sent you to your grave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do but go with me to my mother's house;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There shall you live in secret for a space,</p>
<empty-line/>

Only to see the end of such lewd lust,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And know the difference of a chaste wife's bed,</p>

And one whose life is in all looseness led.</p>

Her counsel, conference, and company</p>

May much avail me; there a space I'll stay,</p>

Upon condition, as you said before,</p>

You never will move your unchaste suit more.</p>

<p>Y. ART. What, Mistress Mary?</p>
<p>MRS MA. O good Master Arthur,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where have you been this week, this month, this year?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This year, said I? where have you been this age?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto a lover ev'ry minute seems</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Time out of mind:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How should I think you love me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That can endure to stay so long from me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I' faith, sweetheart, I saw thee yesternight.</p>
<p>MRS MA. Ay, true, you did, but since you saw me not;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At twelve o'clock you parted from my house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now 'tis morning, and new-strucken seven;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Seven hours thou stay'd'st from me; why didst thou so?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They are my seven years' 'prenticeship of woe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I prythee, be patient; I had some occasion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That did enforce me from thee yesternight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Ay, you are soon enforc'd; fool that I am,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To dote on one that nought respecteth me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis but my fortune, I am born to bear it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ev'ry one shall have their destiny.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Nay, weep not, wench; thou wound'st me with thy tears.</p>
<p>MRS MA. I am a fool, and so you make me too;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These tears were better kept than spent in waste</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On one that neither tenders them nor me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What remedy? but if I chance to die,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or to miscarry with that I go withal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll take my death that thou art cause thereof;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You told me that, when your wife was dead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You would forsake all others, and take me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I told thee so, and I will keep my word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for that end I came thus early to thee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have procur'd a licence, and this night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We will be married in a lawless[20] church.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS. MA. These news revive me, and do somewhat ease</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The thought that was new-gotten to my heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But shall it be to-night?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Ay, wench, to-night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A se'nnight and odd days, since my wife died,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is past already, and her timeless death</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is but a nine-days' talk; come, go with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And it shall be despatched presently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS. MA. Nay, then, I see thou lov'st me; and I find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By this last motion thou art grown more kind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. My love and kindness, like my age, shall grow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with the time increase; and thou shalt see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The older I grow, the kinder I will be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS. MA, Ay, so I hope it will; but, as for mine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That with my age shall day by day decline.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, shall we go?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. With thee to the world's end,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose beauty most admire, and all commend.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>SCENE III.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>The Street near the House of Anselm's Mother</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> ANSELM <emphasis>and</emphasis> FULLER.</p>
<p>ANS. 'Tis true, as I relate the circumstance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she is with my mother safe at home;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But yet, for all the hate I can allege</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against her husband, nor for all the love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That on my own part I can urge her to,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will she be won to gratify my love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. All things are full of ambiguity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I admire this wond'rous accident.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, Anselm, Arthur's about a new wife, <emphasis>a bona roba</emphasis>;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How will she take it when she hears this news?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. I think, even as a virtuous maiden should;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It may be that report may, from thy mouth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beget some pity from her flinty heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will urge her with it presently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Unless report be false, they are link'd already;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They are fast as words can tie them: I will tell thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How I, by chance, did meet him the last night:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One said to me this Arthur did intend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To have a wife, and presently to marry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Amidst the street, I met him as my friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to his love a present he did carry;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It was some ring, some stomacher, or toy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I spake to him, and bad God give him joy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

God give me joy, quoth he; of what, I pray?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, quoth I, your wedding that is toward.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis false, quoth he, and would have gone his way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, come, quoth I, so near it and so froward:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I urg'd him hard by our familiar loves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pray'd him withal not to forget my gloves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then he began:—Your kindness hath been great,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your courtesy great, and your love not common;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet so much favour pray let me entreat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be excus'd from marrying any woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I knew the wench that is become his bride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And smil'd to think how deeply he had lied;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For first he swore he did not court a maid;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wife he could not, she was elsewhere tied;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And as for such as widows were, he said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And deeply swore none such should be his bride:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Widow, nor wife, nor maid—I ask'd no more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Knowing he was betroth'd unto a whore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Is it not Mistress Mary that you mean?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She that did dine with us at Arthur's house?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR.</p>
<p>FUL. The same, the same:—here comes the gentlewoman;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Mistress Arthur, I am of your counsel:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Welcome from death to life!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Mistress, this gentleman hath news to tell ye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And as you like of it, so think of me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Your husband hath already got a wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A huffing wench, i' faith, whose ruffling silks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make with their motion music unto love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And you are quite forgotten.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. I have sworn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To move this my unchaste demand no more.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. When doth your colour change? When do your eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sparkle with fire to revenge these wrongs?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When doth your tongue break into rage and wrath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against that scum of manhood, your vile husband?'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He first misus'd you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. And yet can you love him?</p>
<p>FUL. He left your chaste bed, to defile the bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of sacred marriage with a courtesan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Yet can you love him?</p>
<p>FUL. And, not content with this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Abus'd your honest name with sland'rous words,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fill'd your hush'd house with unquietness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. And can you love him yet?</p>
<p>FUL. Nay, did he not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With his rude fingers dash you on the face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And double-dye your coral lips with blood?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath he not torn those gold wires from your head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wherewith Apollo would have strung his harp,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kept them to play music to the gods?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath he not beat you, and with his rude fists</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon that crimson temperature of your cheeks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Laid a lead colour with his boist'rous blows?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. And can you love him yet?</p>
<p>FUL. Then did he not,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Either by poison or some other plot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Send you to death where, by his providence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

God hath preserved you by that wond'rous miracle?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, after death, hath he not scandalis'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your place with an immodest courtesan?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. And can you love him yet?</p>
<p>MRS ART. And yet, and yet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And still, and ever whilst I breathe this air:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, after death, my unsubstantial soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a good angel, shall attend on him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And keep him from all harm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But is he married? much good do his heart!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pray God, she may content him better far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than I have done; long may they live in peace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till I disturb their solace; but because</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I fear some mischief doth hang o'er his head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll weep my eyes dry with my present care,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for their healths make hoarse my tongue with prayer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                                 [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Art sure she is a woman? if she be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She is create of nature's purity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. O yes, I too well know she is a woman;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Henceforth my virtue shall my love withstand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And of my striving thoughts get th'upper hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Then, thus resolv'd, I straight will drink to thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A health thus deep, to drown thy melancholy.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>A Room in Mistress Mary's House</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS MARY, YOUNG MASTER ARTHUR,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    BRABO, <emphasis>and</emphasis> MISTRESS SPLAY.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Not have my will! yes, I will have my will;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall I not go abroad but when you please?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can I not now and then meet with my friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, at my coming home, you will control me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, come up!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Where art thou, patience?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, rather, where's become my former spleen?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I had a wife would not have us'd me so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Why, you Jacksauce! you cuckold! you what-not!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, am I not of age sufficient</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To go and come still, when my pleasure serves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But must I have you, sir, to question me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not have my will! yes, I will have my will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I had a wife would not have us'd me so;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But she is dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BRA. Not have her will, sir! she shall have her will:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She says she will, and, sir, I say she shall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not have her will! that were a jest indeed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who says she shall not? if I be dispos'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To man her forth, who shall find fault with it?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What's he that dare say black's her eye?[21]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though you be married, sir, yet you must know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That she was ever born to have her will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. Not have her will! God's passion! I say still,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A woman's nobody that wants her will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Where is my spirit? what, shall I maintain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A strumpet with a Brabo and her bawd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To beard me out of my authority?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, am I from a master made a slave?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. A slave? nay, worse; dost thou maintain my man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this my maid? 'tis I maintain them both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am thy wife; I will not be dress'd so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While thy gold lasts; but then most willingly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will bequeath thee to flat beggary.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I do already hate thee; do thy worst;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                  [<emphasis>He threatens her</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, touch me, if thou dar'st; what, shall he beat me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BRA. I'll make him seek his fingers 'mongst the dogs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That dares to touch my mistress; never fear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My sword shall smoothe the wrinkles of his brows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That bends a frown upon my mistress.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I had a wife would not have us'd me so:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But God is just.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Now, Arthur, if I knew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What in this world would most torment thy soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I would do; would all my evil usage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could make thee straight despair and hang thyself!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, I remember:—where is Arthur's man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pipkin? that slave! go, turn him out of doors;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

None that loves Arthur shall have house-room here.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> PIPKIN.</p>
<p>Yonder he comes; Brabo, discard the fellow.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Shall I be over-master'd in my own?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be thyself, Arthur:—strumpet! he shall stay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. What! shall he, Brabo? shall he, Mistress Splay?</p>
<p>BRA. Shall he? he shall not: breathes there any living</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dares say he shall, when Brabo says he shall not?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Is there no law for this? she is my wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should I complain, I should be rather mock'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am content; keep by thee whom thou list.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Discharge whom thou think'st good; do what thou wilt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rise, go to bed, stay at home, or go abroad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At thy good pleasure, keep all companies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So that, for all this, I may have but peace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be unto me as I was to my wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Only give me, what I denied her then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A little love, and some small quietness—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If he displease thee, turn him out of doors.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PIP. Who, me? Turn me out of doors? Is this all the wages I shall have
at the year's end, to be turned out of doors? You, mistress! you are a—</p>
<p>MRS SPLAY. A what? speak, a what? touch her and touch me, taint her and
taint me; speak, speak, a what?</p>
<p>PIP. Marry, a woman that is kin to the frost.[22]</p>
<p>MRS SPLAY. How do you mean that?</p>
<p>PIP. And you are akin to the Latin word, to understand.</p>
<p>MRS SPLAY. And what's that?</p>
<p>PIP. <emphasis>Subaudi, subaudi</emphasis>? and, sir, do you not use to pink doublets?</p>
<p>MRS SPLAY. And why?</p>
<p>PIP. I took you for a cutter, you are of a great kindred; you are a
common cozener, everybody calls you cousin; besides, they say you are
a very good warrener, you have been an old coneycatcher: but, if I be
turned a-begging, as I know not what I am born to, and that you ever
come to the said trade, as nothing is unpossible, I'll set all the
commonwealth of beggars on your back, and all the congregation of vermin
shall be put to your keeping; and then if you be not more bitten than
all the company of beggars besides, I'll not have my will: zounds!
turned out of doors! I'll go and set up my trade; a dish to drink in,
that I have within; a wallet, that I'll make of an old shirt; then my
speech, For the Lord's sake, I beseech your worship; then I must have
a lame leg; I'll go to football and break my shins—and I am provided
for that.</p>
<p>BRA. What! stands the villain prating? hence, you slave!</p>

<p>Y. ART. Art thou yet pleas'd?</p>
<p>MRS MA. When I have had my humour.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Good friends, for manners' sake awhile withdraw.</p>
<p>BRA. It is our pleasure, sir, to stand aside.</p>
<p>               [MISTRESS SPLAY <emphasis>and</emphasis> BRABO <emphasis>stand aside</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Mary, what cause hast thou to use me thus?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From nothing I have rais'd thee to much wealth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twas more than I did owe thee: many a pound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, many a hundred pound, I spent on thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In my wife's time; and once, but by my means,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou hadst been in much danger: but in all things</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My purse and credit ever bare thee out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I did not owe thee this. I had a wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That would have laid herself beneath my feet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To do me service; her I set at nought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For the entire affection I bare thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To show that I have lov'd thee, have I not,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above all women, made chief choice of thee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An argument sufficient of my love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What reason then hast thou to wrong me thus?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. It is my humour.</p>
<p>Y. ART. O, but such humours honest wives should purge:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll show thee a far greater instance yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the true love that I have borne to thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou knew'st my wife: was she not fair?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. So, so.</p>
<p>Y. ART. But more than fair: was she not virtuous?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Endued with the beauty of the mind?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Faith, so they said.</p>
<p>Y. ART. Hark, in thine ear: I'll trust thee with my life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than which what greater instance of my love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou knew'st full well how suddenly she died?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'enjoy thy love, even then I poison'd her!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. How! poison'd her? accursed murderer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll ring this fatal 'larum in all ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than which what greater instance of my hate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Wilt thou not keep my counsel?</p>
<p>MRS MA. Villain, no!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou'lt poison me, as thou hast poison'd her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Dost thou reward me thus for all my love?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then, Arthur, fly, and seek to save thy life!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, difference 'twixt a chaste and unchaste wife!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                            [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Pursue the murd'rer, apprehend him straight.</p>
<p>BRA. Why, what's the matter, mistress?</p>
<p>MRS MA. This villain Arthur poison'd his first wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which he in secret hath confess'd to me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go and fetch warrants from the justices</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'attach the murd'rer; he once hang'd and dead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His wealth is mine: pursue the slave that's fled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BRA. Mistress, I will; he shall not pass this land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I will bring him bound with this strong hand.</p>

<p>SCENE II.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>The Street before the House of Anselm's Mother</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR, <emphasis>poorly</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MRS ART. O, what are the vain pleasures of the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That in their actions we affect them so?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had I been born a servant, my low life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had steady stood from all these miseries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The waving reeds stand free from every gust,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When the tall oaks are rent up by the roots.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What is vain beauty but an idle breath?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why are we proud of that which so soon changes?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But rather wish the beauty of the mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which neither time can alter, sickness change,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Violence deface, nor the black hand of envy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Smudge and disgrace, or spoil, or make deform'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, had my riotous husband borne this mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He had been happy, I had been more blest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And peace had brought our quiet souls to rest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> YOUNG MASTER ARTHUR.</p>
<p>Y. ART. O, whither shall I fly to save my life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When murder and despair dogs at my heels?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O misery! thou never found'st a friend;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All friends forsake men in adversity:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My brother hath denied to succour me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upbraiding me with name of murderer;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My uncles double-bar their doors against me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father hath denied to shelter me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And curs'd me worse than Adam did vile Eve.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I that, within these two days, had more friends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than I could number with arithmetic,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have now no more than one poor cypher is,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that poor cypher I supply myself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All that I durst commit my fortunes to,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have tried, and find none to relieve my wants.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My sudden flight and fear of future shame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Left me unfurnish'd of all necessaries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And these three days I have not tasted food.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. It is my husband; O, how just is heaven!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Poorly disguis'd, and almost hunger-starv'd!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How comes this change?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Doth no man follow me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, how suspicious guilty murder is!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I starve for hunger, and I die for thirst.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had I a kingdom, I would sell my crown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For a small bit of bread: I shame to beg,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet, perforce, I must or beg or starve.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This house, belike, 'longs to some gentlewoman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And here's a woman: I will beg of her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good mistress, look upon a poor man's wants.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom do I see? tush! Arthur, she is dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But that I saw her dead and buried,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would have sworn it had been Arthur's wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I will leave her; shame forbids me beg</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of one so much resembles her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Come hither, fellow! wherefore dost thou turn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy guilty looks and blushing face aside?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It seems thou hast not been brought up to this.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. You say true, mistress; then for charity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for her sake whom you resemble most.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pity my present want and misery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. It seems thou hast been in some better plight;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sit down, I prythee: men, though they be poor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should not be scorn'd; to ease thy hunger, first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Eat these conserves; and now, I prythee, tell me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What thou hast been—thy fortunes, thy estate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And what she was that I resemble most?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. First, look that no man see or overhear us:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I think that shape was born to do me good.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Hast thou known one that did resemble me?</p>
<p>Y. ART. Ay, mistress; I cannot choose but weep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To call to mind the fortunes of her youth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Tell me, of what estate or birth was she?</p>
<p>Y. ART, Born of good parents, and as well brought up;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Most fair, but not so fair as virtuous;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Happy in all things but her marriage;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her riotous husband, which I weep to think,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By his lewd life, made them both miscarry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Why dost thou grieve at their adversities?</p>
<p>Y. ART. O, blame me not; that man my kinsman was,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nearer to me a kinsman could not be;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As near allied was that chaste woman too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nearer was never husband to his wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He whom I term my friend, no friend of mine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Proving both mine and his own enemy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Poison'd his wife—O, the time he did so!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Joyed at her death, inhuman slave to do so!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Exchang'd her love for a base strumpet's lust;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Foul wretch! accursed villain! to exchange so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. You are wise and blest, and happy to repent so:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But what became of him and his new wife?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. O, hear the justice of the highest heaven:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This strumpet, in reward of all his love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pursues him for the death of his first wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now the woful husband languisheth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And flies abroad,[23] pursu'd by her fierce hate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now too late he doth repent his sin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ready to perish in his own despair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Having no means but death to rid his care.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. I can endure no more, but I must weep;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My blabbing tears cannot my counsel keep.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Why weep you, mistress? if you had the heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of her whom you resemble in your face—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But she is dead, and for her death</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sponge of either eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall weep red tears, till every vein is dry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Why weep you, friend? your rainy drops pray keep;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Repentance wipes away the drops of sin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet tell me, friend—he did exceeding ill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wife that lov'd and honour'd him to kill.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet say one like her, far more chaste than fair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bids him be of good comfort, not despair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her soul's appeased with his repentant tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wishing he may survive her many years.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fain would I give him money to supply</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His present wants, but fearing he should fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And getting over to some foreign shore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These rainy eyes should never see him more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart is full, I can no longer stay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But what I am, my love must needs bewray.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farewell, good fellow, and take this to spend;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Say, one like her commends her to your friend.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. No friend of mine. I was my own soul's foe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To murther my chaste wife, that lov'd me so!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In life she lov'd me dearer than her life:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What husband here but would wish such a wife?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hear the officers with hue and cry;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She saved my life but now, and now I die.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And welcome, death! I will not stir from hence;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Death I deserv'd, I'll die for this offence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> BRABO, <emphasis>with</emphasis> OFFICERS, MISTRESS SPLAY, <emphasis>and</emphasis> HUGH.</p>
<p>BRA. Here is the murderer; and, Reason's man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have the warrant: sirs, lay hands on him;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Attach the slave, and lead him bound to death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>HUGH. No, by my faith, Master Brabo, you have the better heart, at
least you should have; I am sure you have more iron and steel than I
have; do you lay hands on him; I promise you I dare not.</p>
<p>BRA. Constables, forward; forward, officers;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not thrust my finger in the fire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lay hands on him, I say: why step you back?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I mean to be the hindmost, lest that any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should run away, and leave the rest in peril.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stand forward: are you not asham'd to fear?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Nay, never strive; behold, I yield myself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I must commend your resolution</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That, being so many and so weapon'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dare not adventure on a man unarm'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, lead me to what prison you think best.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet use me well; I am a gentleman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>HUGH. Truly, Master Arthur, we will use you as well as heart can think;
the justices sit to-day, and my master is chief: you shall command me.</p>
<p>BRA. What! hath he yielded? if he had withstood us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This curtle-axe of mine had cleft his head;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Resist he durst not, when he once spied me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, lead him hence: how lik'st thou this, sweet witch?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This fellow's death will make our mistress rich.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. I say, I care not who's dead or alive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So by their lives or deaths we two may thrive.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>HUGH. Come, bear him away.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>A Room, in Justice Season's House</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> JUSTICE REASON, OLD MASTER ARTHUR,
    <emphasis>and</emphasis> OLD MASTER LUSAM.</p>
<p>JUS. Old Master Arthur and Master Lusam, so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is that I have heard both your complaints,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But understood neither, for, you know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Legere et non intelligere negligere est</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. I come for favour, as a father should,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pitying the fall and ruin of his son.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. I come for justice, as a father should,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That hath by violent murder lost his daughter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. You come for favour, and you come for justice:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Justice with favour is not partial,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, using that, I hope to please you both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Good Master Justice, think upon my son.</p>
<p>O. LUS. Good Master Justice, think upon my daughter.</p>
<p>JUS. Why, so I do; I think upon them both;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But can do neither of you good;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For he that lives must die, and she that's dead</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cannot be revived.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Lusam, thou seek'st to rob me of my son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My only son.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. He robb'd me of my daughter, my only daughter.</p>
<p>JUS. And robbers are flat felons by the law.</p>
<p>O. ART. Lusam, I say thou art a blood-sucker,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A tyrant, a remorseless cannibal:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Old as I am, I'll prove it on thy bones.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Am I a blood-sucker or cannibal?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Am I a tyrant that do thirst for blood?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Ay, if thou seek'st the ruin of my son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou art a tyrant and a blood-sucker.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Ay, if I seek the ruin of thy son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am indeed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Nay, more, thou art a dotard;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, in the right of my accused son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I challenge thee the field. Meet me, I say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To-morrow morning beside Islington,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bring thy sword and buckler, if thou dar'st.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Meet thee with my sword and buckler?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There's my glove.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll meet thee, to revenge my daughter's death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Call'st thou me dotard? Though these threescore years</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I never handled weapon but a knife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To cut my meat, yet will I meet thee there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

God's precious! call me dotard?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. I have cause,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Just cause, to call thee dotard, have I not?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Nay, that's another matter; have you cause?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then God forbid that I should take exceptions</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be call'd dotard of one that hath cause.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. My masters, you must leave this quarrelling, for quarrellers are
never at peace; and men of peace, while they are at quiet, are never
quarrelling: so you, whilst you fall into brawls, you cannot choose but
jar. Here comes your son accused, and his wife the accuser; stand forth
both. Hugh, be ready with your pen and ink to take their examinations
and confessions.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS MARY, BRABO, YOUNG MASTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    ARTHUR, MISTRESS SPLAY, HUGH, <emphasis>and</emphasis> OFFICERS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. It shall not need; I do confess the deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of which this woman here accuseth me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I poison'd my first wife, and for that deed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I yield me to the mercy of the law.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Villain! thou mean'st my only daughter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in her death depriv'dst me of all joys.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I mean her. I do confess the deed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And though my body taste the force of law,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like an offender, on my knee I beg</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your angry soul will pardon me her death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. Nay, if he kneeling do confess the deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No reason but I should forgive her death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. But so the law must not be satisfied;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Blood must have blood, and men must have death;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I think that cannot be dispens'd withal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. If all the world else would forgive the deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet would I earnestly pursue the law.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I had a wife would not have us'd me so;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The wealth of Europe could not hire her tongue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be offensive to my patient ears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, in exchanging her, I did prefer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A devil before a saint, night before day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hell before heaven, and dross before tried gold;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Never was bargain with such damage sold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BRA. If you want witness to confirm the deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I heard him speak it; and that to his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before this presence, I will justify;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not part hence, till I see him swing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. I heard him too: pity but he should die,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And like a murderer be sent to hell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To poison her, and make her belly swell!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. Why stay you, then? give judgment on the slave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose shameless life deserves a shameful grave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Death's bitter pangs are not so full of grief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As this unkindness: every word thou speak'st</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is a sharp dagger thrust quite through my heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As little I deserve this at thy hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As my kind patient wife deserv'd of me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I was her torment, God hath made thee mine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then wherefore at just plagues should I repine?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Where did'st thou buy this poison? for such drugs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are felony for any man to sell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I had the poison of Aminadab:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, innocent man, he was not accessory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To my wife's death; I clear him of the deed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. No matter; fetch him, fetch him, bring him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To answer to this matter at the bar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hugh, take these officers and apprehend him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BRA. I'll aid him too; the schoolmaster, I see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps may hang with him for company.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> ANSELM <emphasis>and</emphasis> FULLER.</p>
<p>ANS. This is the day of Arthur's examination</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And trial for the murder of his wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let's hear how Justice Reason will proceed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In censuring of his strict punishment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Anselm, content; let's thrust in 'mong the throng.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> AMINADAB, <emphasis>brought in with</emphasis> OFFICERS.</p>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>O Domine</emphasis>! what mean these knaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To lead me thus with bills and glaves?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, what example would it be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all my pupils for to see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To tread their steps all after me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If for some fault I hanged be;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Somewhat surely I shall mar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you bring me to the bar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But peace; betake thee to thy wits,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For yonder Justice Reason sits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Sir Dab, Sir Dab, here's one accuseth you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To give him poison, being ill-employ'd:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Speak, how in this case you can clear yourself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. <emphasis>Hei mihi</emphasis>! what should I say? the poison given I deny;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He took it perforce from my hands, and, <emphasis>Domine</emphasis>, why not?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I got it of a gentleman; he most freely gave it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As he knew me; my meaning was only to have it.[24]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. 'Tis true, I took it from this man perforce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And snatch'd it from his hand by rude constraint,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which proves him in this act not culpable.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Ay, but who sold the poison unto him?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That must be likewise known; speak, schoolmaster.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. A man <emphasis>verbosus</emphasis>, that was a fine <emphasis>generosus</emphasis>;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was a great guller, his name I take to be Fuller;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See where he stands, that unto my hands convey'd a powder;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, like a knave, sent her to her grave, obscurely to shroud her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Lay hands on him; are you a poison-seller?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bring him before us: sirrah, what say you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sold you a poison to this honest man?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. I sold no poison, but I gave him one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To kill his rats?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. Ha, ha! I smell a rat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You sold him poison then to kill his rats?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The word to kill argues a murd'rous mind;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And you are brought in compass of the murder</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So set him by, we will not hear him speak:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That Arthur, Fuller, and the schoolmaster,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall by the judges be examined.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANS. Sir, if my friend may not speak for himself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet let me his proceedings justify.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUS. What's he that will a murther justify?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lay hands on him, lay hands on him, I say;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For justifiers are all accessories,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And accessories have deserved to die.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away with him! we will not hear him speak;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They all shall to the High Commissioners.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MISTRESS ARTHUR.</p>
<p>MRS ART. Nay, stay them, stay them yet a little while!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I bring a warrant to the contrary;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will please all parties presently.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I think my wife's ghost haunts me to my death;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wretch that I was, to shorten her life's breath!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. Whom do I see, my son's wife?</p>
<p>O. LUS. What, my daughter?</p>
<p>JUS. Is it not Mistress Arthur that we see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That long since buried we suppos'd to be?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. This man's condemn'd for pois'ning of his wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His poison'd wife yet lives, and I am she;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And therefore justly I release his bands:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This man, for suff'ring him these drugs to take,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is likewise bound, release him for my sake:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This gentleman that first the poison gave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this his friend, to be releas'd I crave:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Murther there cannot be where none is kill'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her blood is sav'd, whom you suppos'd was spill'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Father-in-law, I give you here your son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The act's to do which you suppos'd was done.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, father, now joy in your daughter's life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom heaven hath still kept to be Arthur's wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. O, welcome, welcome, daughter! now I see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

God by his power hath preserved thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. LUS. And 'tis my wench, whom I suppos'd was dead;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My joy revives, and my sad woe is fled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. I know not what I am, nor where I am;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My soul's transported to an ecstasy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For hope and joy confound my memory.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS MA. What do I see? lives Arthur's wife again?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay then I labour for his death in vain.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BRA. What secret force did in her nature lurk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That in her soul the poison would not work?    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS SPLAY. How can it be the poison took no force?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She lives with that which would have kill'd a horse!    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MRS ART. Nay, shun me not; be not asham'd at all;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To heaven, not me, for grace and pardon fall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Look on me, Arthur; blush not at my wrongs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. Still fear and hope my grief and woe prolongs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But tell me, by what power thou didst survive?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With my own hands I temper'd that vile draught,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That sent thee breathless to thy grandsire's grave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If that were poison I receiv'd of him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. That <emphasis>ego nescio</emphasis>, but this dram</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Receiv'd I of this gentleman;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The colour was to kill my rats,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But 'twas my own life to despatch.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FUL. Is it even so? then this ambiguous doubt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No man can better than myself decide;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That compound powder was of poppy made and mandrakes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of purpose to cast one into a sleep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To ease the deadly pain of him whose leg</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should be saw'd off;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That powder gave I to the schoolmaster.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMIN. And that same powder, even that <emphasis>idem</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You took from me, the same, <emphasis>per fidem</emphasis>!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. And that same powder I commix'd with wine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our godly knot of wedlock to untwine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O. ART. But, daughter, who did take thee from thy grave?</p>
<p>O. LUS. Discourse it, daughter.</p>
<p>ANS. Nay, that labour save;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pardon me, Master Arthur, I will now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Confess the former frailty of my love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your modest wife with words I tempted oft;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But neither ill I could report of you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor any good I could forge for myself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would win her to attend to my request;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, after death I lov'd her, insomuch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That to the vault where she was buried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My constant love did lead me through the dark,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There ready to have ta'en my last farewell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The parting kiss I gave her I felt warm;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Briefly, I bare her to my mother's house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where she hath since liv'd the most chaste and true,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That since the world's creation eye did view.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Y. ART. My first wife, stand you here: my second, there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in the midst, myself; he that will choose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A good wife from a bad, come learn of me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That have tried both, in wealth and misery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A good wife will be careful of her fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her husband's credit, and her own good name;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And such art thou. A bad wife will respect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her pride, her lust, and her good name neglect;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And such art thou. A good wife will be still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Industrious, apt to do her husband's will;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But a bad wife, cross, spiteful and madding,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Never keep home, but always be a-gadding;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And such art thou. A good wife will conceal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her husband's dangers, and nothing reveal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That may procure him harm; and such art thou.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But a bad wife corrupts chaste wedlock's vow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On this hand virtue, and on this hand sin;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This who would strive to lose, or this to win?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here lives perpetual joy, here burning woe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, husbands, choose on which hand you will go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Seek virtuous wives, all husbands will be blest;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fair wives are good, but virtuous wives are best.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They that my fortunes will peruse, shall find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No beauty's like the beauty of the mind.</p>

by the Students in Saint Iohns Colledge in Cambridge. At London Printed
by G. Eld, for Iohn Wright, and are to bee sold at his shop at
Christchurch Gate_. 1606. 4to.</p>
<p>[See Hazlitt's "Handbook," p. 470. Almost all the extant copies of this
drama—and no fewer than ten have been examined—appear to vary in
certain literal particulars. Of two copies in the Malone collection, one
presents additions which might bespeak it a later impression than the
other; and yet, on the other hand, has errors (some of a serious kind)
peculiar to itself. The text has now been considerably improved by the
collection of the quartos at Oxford.</p>
<p>It was the intention of my kind acquaintance, the Rev. J.W. Ebsworth,
Vicar of Moldash, by Ashford, Kent, to have reprinted the "Return from
Parnassus" separately; but on learning that I intended to include it in
my series, Mr Ebsworth not only gave way, but obligingly placed the
annotated copy which he had prepared, at my free disposal.</p>
<p>I have also to thank Dr Ingleby, of Valentines, near Ilford, Essex, for
lending me a copy of the play corresponding with one of those in the
Bodleian, as regards its occasionally various readings.</p>
<p>A long account, and very favourable estimate, of this drama will be
found in Hazlitt's "Dramatic Literature of the Age of Elizabeth," 1820.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>[HAWKINS'S PREFACE.]</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>We can learn no more of the history of this play than what the
title-page gives us, viz., that it was "publickly acted by the students
in Saint John's College, Cambridge."[25] The merits and characters of
our old poets and actors are censured by the author with great freedom;
and the shameful prostitution of Church preferment, by the selling of
livings to the ignorant and unworthy, laid the foundation of Dr Wild's
"Benefice, a Comedy," 4to, 1689.</p>
<p>[Hawkins himself elsewhere (in his "General Introduction") remarks:—]</p>
<p>As the piece which follows, called "The Return from Parnassus," is,
perhaps, the most singular composition in our language, it may be proper
to give a succinct analysis of it. This satirical drama seems to have
been composed by the wits and scholars of Cambridge, where it was acted
at the opening of the last century. The design of it was to expose the
vices and follies of the rich in those days, and to show that little
attention was paid by that class of men to the learned and ingenious.
Several students of various capacities and dispositions leave the
university in hopes of advancing their fortunes in the metropolis. One
of them attempts to recommend himself by his publications; another, to
procure a benefice by paying his court to a young spark named Amoretto,
with whom he had been intimate at college; two others endeavour to gain
a subsistence by successively appearing as physicians, actors, and
musicians: but the Man of Genius is disregarded, and at last prosecuted
for his productions; the benefice is sold to an illiterate clown; and in
the end three of the scholars are compelled to submit to a voluntary
exile; another returns to Cambridge as poor as when he left it; and the
other two, finding that neither their medicines nor their music would
support them, resolve to turn shepherds, and to spend the rest of their
days on the Kentish downs. There is a great variety of characters in
this play, which are excellently distinguished and supported; and some
of the scenes have as much wit as can be desired in a perfect comedy.
The simplicity of its plan must naturally bring to our mind the old
species of comedy described by Horace, in which, before it was
restrained by a public edict, living characters were exposed by name
upon the stage, and the audience made merry at their expense without any
intricacy of plot or diversity of action: thus in the piece before us
Burbage and Kempe, two famous actors, appear in their proper persons;
and a number of acute observations are made on the poets of that age, of
whom the editor has given an account in the notes, and has added some
chosen specimens of their poetry.</p>
<p>[The late Mr Bolton Corney thought that this play was from the pen of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

John Day. We learn from the Prologue that a drama, of which nothing is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

now known, preceded it, under the title of "The Pilgrimage to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Parnassus." The loss is perhaps to be regretted.]</p>

<p>

Spectators, we will act a comedy: <emphasis>non plus</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>STAGEKEEPER.
A pox on't, this book hath it not in it: you would be whipped, thou
rascal; thou must be sitting up all night at cards, when thou should be
conning thy part.</p>
<p>BOY.
It's all along on you; I could not get my part a night or two before,
that I might sleep on it.</p>
<p>               [STAGEKEEPER <emphasis>carrieth the</emphasis> BOY <emphasis>away under his arm</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MOMUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It's even well done; here is such a stir about a scurvy English show!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DEFENSOR.
Scurvy in thy face, thou scurvy Jack: if this company were not,—you
paltry critic gentleman, you that know what it is to play at primero or
passage—you that have been student at post and pair, saint and loadam
—you that have spent all your quarter's revenues in riding post one
night in Christmas, bear with the weak memory of a gamester.</p>
<p>MOMUS.
Gentlemen, you that can play at noddy, or rather play upon noddies—you
that can set up a jest at primero instead of a rest, laugh at the
prologue, that was taken away in a voider.</p>
<p>DEFENSOR.
What we present, I must needs confess, is but slubber'd invention: if
your wisdom obscure the circumstance, your kindness will pardon the
substance.</p>
<p>MOMUS.
What is presented here is an old musty show, that hath lain this
twelvemonth in the bottom of a coal-house amongst brooms and old shoes;
an invention that we are ashamed of, and therefore we have promised the
copies to the chandler to wrap his candles in.</p>
<p>DEFENSOR.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It's but a Christmas toy; and may it please your courtesies to let it pass.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MOMUS.
It's a Christmas toy, indeed! as good a conceit as sloughing[26]
hotcockles or blindman-buff.</p>
<p>DEFENSOR.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some humours you shall see aimed at, if not well-resembled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MOMUS.
Humours, indeed! Is it not a pretty humour to stand hammering upon two
<emphasis>individuum vagum</emphasis>, two scholars, some whole year? These same Philomusus
and Studioso have been followed with a whip and a verse, like a couple
of vagabonds, through England and Italy. The Pilgrimage to Parnassus and
the Return from Parnassus have stood the honest stagekeepers in many a
crown's expense for links and vizards; purchased a sophister a knock
with[27] a club; hindered the butler's box,[28] and emptied the college
barrels: and now, unless you know the subject well, you may return home
as wise as you came, for this last is the least part of the return from
Parnassus: that is both the first and last time that the author's wit
will turn upon the toe in this vein, and at this time the scene is not
at Parnassus, that is, looks not good invention in the face.</p>
<p>DEFENSOR.
If the catastrophe please you not, impute it to the unpleasing fortunes
of discontented scholars.</p>
<p>MOMUS.
For catastrophe, there's never a tale in Sir John Mandeville or Bevis
of Southampton, but hath a better turning.</p>
<p>STAGEKEEPER.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, you jeering ass! begone, with a pox!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MOMUS.
You may do better to busy yourself in providing beer; for the show
will be pitiful dry, pitiful dry.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>STAGEKEEPER.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No more of this: I heard the spectators ask for a blank verse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What we show is but a Christmas jest;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Conceive of this, and guess of all the rest:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Full like a scholar's hapless fortune's penn'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose former griefs seldom have happy end.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Frame as well we might with easy strain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With far more praise and with as little pain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stories of love, where forne[29] the wond'ring bench</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The lisping gallant might enjoy his wench;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or make some sire acknowledge his lost son:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Found, when the weary act is almost done.[30]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor unto this, nor unto that our scene is bent;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We only show a scholar's discontent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In scholars' fortunes, twice forlorn and dead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Twice hath our weary pen erst laboured;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Making them pilgrims in Parnassus' Hill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then penning their return with ruder quill.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now we present unto each pitying eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The scholars' progress in their misery:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Refined wits, your patience is our bliss;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too weak our scene, too great your judgment is:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To you we seek to show a scholar's state,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His scorned fortunes, his unpity'd fate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To you: for if you did not scholars bless,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their case, poor case, were too-too pitiless.</p>

Not gently laying on, but fetching blood;</p>

So, surgeon-like, thou dost with cutting heal,</p>

Where nought but lancing[33] can the wound avail:</p>

O, suffer me, among so many men,</p>

To tread aright the traces of thy pen,</p>

And light my link at thy eternal flame,</p>

<p>JUDICIO.
What, Ingenioso, carrying a vinegar bottle about thee, like a great
schoolboy giving the world a bloody nose?[35]</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
Faith, Judicio, if I carry the vinegar bottle, it's great reason I
should confer it upon the baldpated world: and again, if my kitchen
want the utensils[36] of viands, it's great reason other men should
have the sauce of vinegar; and for the bloody nose, Judicio, I may
chance, indeed, give the world a bloody nose, but it shall hardly give
me a crack'd crown, though it gives other poets French crowns.</p>
<p>JUDICIO.
I would wish thee, Ingenioso, to sheathe thy pen, for thou canst not
be successful in the fray, considering thy enemies have the advantage
of the ground.</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
Or rather, Judicio, they have the grounds with advantage, and the
French crowns with a pox; and I would they had them with a plague too:
but hang them, swads, the basest corner in my thoughts is too gallant
a room to lodge them in. But say, Judicio, what news in your press?
did you keep any late corrections upon any tardy pamphlets?</p>
<p>JUDICIO.
<emphasis>Veterem jubes renovare dolorem</emphasis>, Ingenioso: whate'er befalls thee,
keep thee from the trade of the corrector of the press.</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
Marry, so I will, I warrant thee; if poverty press not too much, I'll
correct no press but the press of the people.</p>
<p>JUDICIO.
Would it not grieve any good spirits to sit a whole month knitting out
a lousy, beggarly pamphlet, and, like a needy physician, to stand whole
years tossing and tumbling the filth that falleth from so many draughty
inventions as daily swarm in our printing-house.</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
Come, I think we shall have you put finger in the eye, and cry, O
friends, no friends! Say, man, what new paper hobby-horses, what
rattle-babies, are come out in your late May morris-dance?</p>
<p>JUDICIO.
Fly[37] my rhymes as thick as flies in the sun; I think there be never
an alehouse in England, not any so base a maypole on a country green,
but sets forth some poet's petronels or demi-lances to the paper wars
in Paul's Churchyard.</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
And well too may the issue of a strong hop learn to hop all over
England, when as better wits sit, like lame cobblers, in their studies.
Such barmy heads will always be working, when as sad vinegar wits sit
souring at the bottom of a barrel; plain meteors, bred of the
exhalation of tobacco and the vapours of a moist pot, that soar[38] up
into the open air, when as sounder wit keeps below.</p>
<p>JUDICIO.
Considering the furies of the times, I could better endure to see those
young can-quaffing hucksters shoot off their pellets, so they would
keep them from these English <emphasis>Flores poetarum</emphasis>; but now the world is
come to that pass, that there starts up every day an old goose that
sits hatching up those eggs which have been filched from the nest of
crows and kestrels. Here is a book, Ingenioso; why, to condemn it to
clear [fire,][39] the usual Tyburn of all misliving papers, were too
fair a death for so foul an offender.</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What's the name of it, I pray thee, Judicio?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUDICIO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Look, it's here; "Belvidere."[40]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>INGENIOSO.
What, a bell-wether in Paul's Churchyard! so called because it keeps a
bleating, or because it hath the tinkling bell of so many poets about
the neck of it? What is the rest of the title?</p>
<p>JUDICIO. "The Garden of the Muses."</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
What have we here, the poet garish, gaily bedecked, like fore-horses of
the parish? What follows?</p>
<p>JUDICIO.
<emphasis>Quem, referent musae, vivet, dum robora tellus,
Dum coelum stellas, dum vehit amnis aquas</emphasis>.
Who blurs fair paper with foul bastard rhymes,
Shall live full many an age in latter times:
Who makes a ballad for an alehouse door,
Shall live in future times for evermore:
Then ( )[41] thy muse shall live so long,
As drafty ballads to thy praise are sung.
But what's his device? Parnassus with the sun and the laurel?[42] I
wonder this owl dares look on the sun; and I marvel this goose flies
not the laurel: his device might have been better, a fool going into
the market-place to be seen, with this motto: <emphasis>Scribimus indocti</emphasis>; or,
a poor beggar gleaning of ears in the end of harvest, with this word:
<emphasis>Sua cuique gloria</emphasis>.</p>
<p>JUDICIO.
Turn over the leaf, Ingenioso, and thou shalt see the pains of this
worthy gentleman: <emphasis>Sentences, gathered out of all kind of poets,
referred to certain methodical heads, profitable for the use of these

A sweeter[43] swan than ever sung in Po,</p>

The prouder groves of self-admiring Rome.</p>
<empty-line/>

Blithe was each valley, and each shepherd proud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While he did chant his rural minstrelsy:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Attentive was full many a dainty ear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, hearers hung upon his melting tongue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While sweetly of his Fairy Queen he sung;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While to the waters' fall he tun'd for fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in each bark engrav'd Eliza's name:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet for all this unregarding soil</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unlac'd the line of his desired life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Denying maintenance for his dear relief;</p>
<empty-line/>

Careless care to prevent his exequy,</p>

But softly may our honour's ashes rest,</p>

That lie by merry Chaucer's noble chest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, I pray thee, proceed briefly in thy censure, that I may be proud</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

of myself; as in the first, so in the last, my censure may jump with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

thine.—Henry Constable, Samuel Daniel,[44] Thomas Lodge, Thomas Watson.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUDICIO.</p>

Sweet Constable[45] doth take the wond'ring ear,</p>

However, he wants one true note of a poet of our times, and that is
this: he cannot swagger it well in a tavern, nor domineer in a
hothouse. John Davis?[49]</p>

Lock and Hudson, sleep, you quiet shavers, among the shavings of the

<empty-line/>
<p>

Methinks he is a ruffian in his style,</p>

<p>

Withouten bands or garters' ornament:</p>

<p>

He quaffs a cup of Frenchman's Helicon;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then roister doister in his oily terms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cuts, thrusts, and foins, at whomsoever he meets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And strews about Ram-Alley meditations.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tut, what cares he for modest close-couch'd terms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cleanly to gird our looser libertines?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give him plain naked words, stripp'd from their shirts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That might beseem plain-dealing Aretine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ay, there is one, that backs a paper steed,</p>

And manageth a penknife gallantly,</p>

Strikes his poinardo at a button's breadth,</p>

As for these, they have some of them been the old hedge-stakes of the
press; and some of them are, at this instant, the bots and glanders of
the printing-house: fellows that stand only upon terms to serve the

needs; and when they write, they write as a bear pisses, now and then
drop a pamphlet.</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
<emphasis>Durum telum necessitas</emphasis>. Good faith, they do, as I do—exchange words
for money. I have some traffic this day with Danter[61] about a little
book which I have made; the name of it is, A Catalogue of Cambridge
Cuckolds. But this Belvidere, this methodical ass, hath made me almost
forget my time; I'll now to Paul's Churchyard; meet me an hour hence at
the sign of the Pegasus in Cheapside, and I'll moist thy temples with a
cup of claret, as hard as the world goes.</p>

<p>INGENIOSO.
Danter, thou art deceived, wit is dearer than thou takest it to be: I
tell thee, this libel of Cambridge has much fat and pepper in the nose;
it will sell sheerly underhand, when all these books of exhortations and
catechisms lie moulding on thy shopboard.</p>
<p>DANTER.
It's true: but, good faith, Master Ingenioso, I lost by your last book;
and, you know, there is many a one that pays me largely for the printing
of their inventions: but, for all this, you shall have forty shillings
and an odd bottle of wine.</p>
<p>INGENIOSO.
Forty shillings! a fit reward for one of your rheumatic poets, that
beslavers all the paper he comes by, and furnishes all the chandlers
with waste-papers to wrap candles in; but as for me, I'll be paid dear
even for the dregs of my wit: little knows the world what belongs to the
keeping of a good wit in waters, diets, drinks, tobacco, &amp;c. It is a
dainty and a costly creature; and therefore I must be paid sweetly.
Furnish me with money, that I may put myself in a new suit of clothes,
and I'll suit thy shop with a new suit of terms. It's the gallantest
child my invention was ever delivered of: the title is, A Chronicle of
Cambridge Cuckolds. Here a man may see what day of the month such a
man's commons were enclosed, and when thrown open; and when any entailed
some odd crowns upon the heirs of their bodies unlawfully begotten.
Speak quickly: else I am gone.</p>
<p>DANTER.
O, this will sell gallantly; I'll have it, whatsoever it cost: will you
walk on, Master Ingenioso? We'll sit over a cup of wine, and agree on it.</p>

London may shortly throw an old shoe after us; and with those shreds of
French that we gathered up in our host's house in Paris, we'll gull the

<p>FUROR POETICUS, <emphasis>rapt with contemplation</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, how now, pedant Phoebus?[71] are you smouching Thaly on her tender</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

lips? There, hoi! peasant, avaunt! Come, pretty short-nosed nymph. O</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

sweet Thalia, I do kiss thy foot. What, Clio? O sweet Clio! Nay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

prythee, do not weep, Melpomene. What, Urania, Polyhymnia, and Calliope!</p>
<empty-line/>

let me do reverence to your deities.</p>

                                   [PHANTASMA <emphasis>pulls him by the sleeve</emphasis>.</p>

<p>

I am your holy swain that, night and day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sit for your sakes, rubbing my wrinkled brow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Studying a month for a epithet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, silver Cynthia, do not trouble me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Straight will I thy Endymion's story write,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To which thou hastest me on day and night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You light-skirt stars, this is your wonted guise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By gloomy light perk out your doubtful heads;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But when Dan[72] Phoebus shows his flashing snout,</p>

You are sky-puppies;[73] straight your light is out.</p>

Who's that runs headlong on my quill's sharp point,</p>

He is a pretty inventor of slight prose;</p>

But there's no spirit in his grov'lling speech.</p>

<p>THEODORE.
[<emphasis>Puts on his spectacles</emphasis>.] Monsieur, here are <emphasis>atomi natantes</emphasis>, which
do make show your worship to be as lecherous as a bull.</p>
<p>BURGESS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Truly, Master Doctor, we are all men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THEODORE.
This vater is intention of heat: are you not perturbed with an ache in
your vace[78] or in your occipit? I mean your headpiece. Let me feel
the pulse of your little finger.</p>
<p>BURGESS.
I'll assure you, Master Theodore, the pulse of my head beats
exceedingly; and I think I have disturbed myself by studying the penal
statutes.</p>
<p>THEODORE.
Tit, tit, your worship takes care of your speeches.
<emphasis>O, Curae leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent</emphasis>: it is an aphorism in Galen.</p>
<p>BURGESS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And what is the exposition of that?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THEODORE.
That your worship must take a gland, <emphasis>ut emittatur sanguis</emphasis>: the sign
is <emphasis>fort</emphasis> excellent, <emphasis>fort</emphasis> excellent.</p>
<p>BURGESS.
Good Master Doctor, use me gently; for, mark you, sir, there is a double
consideration to be had of me: first, as I am a public magistrate;
secondly, as I am a private butcher; and but for the worshipful credit
of the place and office wherein I now stand and live, I would not hazard
my worshipful apparel with a suppository or a glister: but for the
countenancing of the place, I must go oftener to stool; for, as a great
gentleman told me, of good experience, that it was the chief note of a
magistrate not to go to the stool without a physician.</p>
<p>THEODORE.
Ah, vous êtes un gentilhomme, vraiment.—What, ho, Jaques! Jaques,
donnez-vous un fort gentil purgation for Monsieur Burgess.</p>
<p>JAQUES.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Votre très-humble serviteur, à votre commandment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THEODORE.
Donnez-vous un gentil purge à Monsieur Burgess.—I have considered of
the crasis and syntoma of your disease, and here is un fort gentil
purgation per evacuationem excrementorum, as we physicians use to
parley.</p>
<p>BURGESS.
I hope, Master Doctor, you have a care of the country's officer. I tell
you, I durst not have trusted myself with every physician; and yet I am
not afraid for myself, but I would not deprive the town of so careful a
magistrate.</p>
<p>THEODORE.
O Monsieur, I have a singular care of your <emphasis>valetudo</emphasis>. It is requisite
that the French physicians be learned and careful; your English
velvet-cap is malignant and envious.</p>
<p>BURGESS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here is, Master Doctor, fourpence—your due, and eightpence—my bounty.</p>

simony?                           <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Money.
What, is the world a game? are livings gotten
by paying?[82]                   <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Paying.
Paying? But say, what's the nearest way to
come by a living?                <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Giving.
Must his worship's fists be needs then oiled with
angels?                          <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Angels.
Ought his gouty fists then first with gold to be
greased?                          <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Eased.
And is it then such an ease for his ass's back to
carry money?                         <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Ay.
Will, then, this golden ass bestow a vicarage
gilded?                          <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Gelded.
What shall I say to good Sir Raderic, that have
no[83] gold here?            <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Cold cheer.
I'll make it my lone request, that he would be
good to a scholar.               <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Choler.
Yea, will he be choleric to hear of an art or a
science?                          <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Hence.
Hence with liberal arts? What, then, will he
do with his chancel?               <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Sell.
Sell it? and must a simple clerk be fain to compound
then?                       <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Pounds then.
What, if I have no pounds? must then my suit
be prorogued?                    <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Rogued.
Yea? given to a rogue? Shall an ass this
vicarage compass?                   <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Ass.
What is the reason that I should not be as fortunate
as he?                           <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Ass he.
Yet, for all this, with a penniless purse will I
trudge to his worship.      <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Words cheap.
Well, if he give me good words, it's more than I
have from an Echo.                   <emphasis>Echo</emphasis>. Go.</p>

What have we here? old truepenny come to town, to fetch away the living
in his old greasy slops? Then, I'll none: the time hath been when such a

now these fellows are grown the only factors for preferment.  [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>

little money to the bishop's poser;[85] for there are certain questions
I make scruple to be posed in.</p>

My name, sir? Stercutio, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMORETTO.
Why then, Stercutio, I would be very willing to be the instrument to my
father, that this living might be conferred upon your son: marry, I
would have you know that I have been importuned by two or three several
lords, my kind cousins, in the behalf of some Cambridge man, and have
almost engaged my word. Marry, if I shall see your disposition to be
more thankful than other men, I shall be very ready to respect
kind-natured men; for, as the Italian proverb speaketh well, <emphasis>chi ha,
havra</emphasis>.</p>

Why, here is a gallant young drover of livings.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>

And I pray you, sir, what is the lowest thanks that you will take?</p>

<p>

The very same method that he useth at the buying of an ox.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>

I must have some odd sprinkling of an hundred pounds; if so, so—I shall
think you thankful, and commend your son as a man of good gifts to my
father.</p>

A sweet world! give an hundred pounds; and this is but counted
thankfulness!    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>

Hark thou, sir; you shall have eighty thanks.</p>

I tell thee, fellow, I never opened my mouth in this kind so cheap
before in my life: I tell thee, few young gentlemen are found that would
deal so kindly with thee as I do.</p>
<p>STERCUTIO.
Well, sir, because I know my son to be a toward thing, and one that has
taken all his learning on his own head, without sending to the
university, I am content to give you as many thanks as you ask, so you
will promise me to bring it to pass.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
I warrant you for that, if I say it once. Repair you to the place, and
stay there. For my father, he is walked abroad to take the benefit of
the air: I'll meet him, as he returns, and make way for your suit.
Gallant, i'faith.[86]</p>

<p>ACADEMICO.
I see, we scholars fish for a living in these shallow fords without a
silver hook. Why, would it not gall a man to see a spruce gartered youth
of our college, a while ago, be a broker for a living and an old bawd
for a benefice? This sweet sir preferred me much kindness when he was of
our college, and now I'll try what wind remains in his bladder. God save
you, sir.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
By the mass, I fear me, I saw this <emphasis>genus</emphasis> and <emphasis>species</emphasis> in Cambridge
before now: I'll take no notice of him now. [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.] By the faith of a
gentleman, this is pretty elegy. Of what age is the day, fellow? Sirrah
boy, hath the groom saddled my hunting hobby? Can Robin hunter tell
where a hare sits?    [<emphasis>Soliloquising</emphasis>.</p>

See a poor Old friend of yours of S—— College in Cambridge.</p>

<p>

Good faith, sir, you must pardon me: I have forgotten you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My name is Academico, sir; one that made an oration for you once on the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Queen's day, and a show that you got some credit by.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMORETTO.
It may be so, it may be so; but I have forgotten it. Marry, yet I
remember that there was such a fellow that I was beneficial unto in my
time. But, howsoever, sir, I have the courtesy of the town for you.
I am sorry you did not take me at my father's house; but now I am in
exceeding great haste, for I have vowed the death of a hare that we
found this morning musing on her meaze.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
Sir, I am emboldened by that great acquaintance that heretofore I had
with you, as likewise it hath pleased you heretofore—</p>
<p>AMORETTO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Look, sirrah, if you see my hobby come hitherward as yet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ACADEMICO.
—to make me some promises, I am to request your good mediation to the
worshipful your father in my behalf: and I will dedicate to yourself,
in the way of thanks, those days I have to live.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
O good sir, if I had known your mind before; for my father hath already
given the induction to a chaplain of his own—to a proper man—I know
not of what university he is.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Signior Immerito, they say, hath bidden fairest for it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMORETTO.
I know not his name; but he is a grave, discreet man, I warrant him:
indeed, he wants utterance in some measure.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
Nay, methinks he hath very good utterance for his gravity, for he came
hither very grave; but, I think, he will return light enough, when he
is rid of the heavy element he carries about him.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Faith, sir, you must pardon me: it is my ordinary custom to be too
studious; my mistress hath told me of it often, and I find it to hurt
my ordinary discourse: but say, sweet sir, do ye affect the most
gentlemanlike game of hunting?</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
How say you to the crafty gull? he would fain get me abroad to make
sport with me in their hunters' terms, which we scholars are not
acquainted with. [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.] Sir, I have loved this kind of sport; but
now I begin to hate it, for it hath been my luck always to beat the
bush, while another killed the hare.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Hunters' luck, hunters' luck, sir; but there was a fault in your hounds,
that did spend well.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, I have had worse luck always at hunting the fox.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMORETTO.
What, sir, do you mean at the unkennelling, untapezing, or earthing of
the fox?</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
I mean, earthing, if you term it so;—for I never found yellow earth
enough to cover the old fox your father.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Good faith, sir, there is an excellent skill in blowing for the terriers;
it is a word that we hunters use. When the fox is earthed, you must blow
one long, two short; the second wind, one long, two short. Now, sir, in
blowing, every long containeth seven quavers, one short containeth three
quavers.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
Sir, might I find any favour in my suit, I would wind the horn, wherein
your boon[87] deserts should be sounded with so many minims, so many
quavers.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Sweet sir, I would I could confer this or any kindness upon you:—I
wonder, the boy comes not away with my hobby. Now, sir, as I was
proceeding—when you blow the death of your fox in the field or covert,
then must you sound three notes with three winds, and recheat, mark you,
sir, upon the same with three winds.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I pray you, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMORETTO.
Now, sir, when you come to your stately gate, as you sounded the recheat
before, so now you must sound the relief three times.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
Relief, call you it? it were good, every patron would find the horn.
                                                           [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
O sir, but your relief is your sweetest note: that is, sir, when your
hounds hunt after a game unknown; and then you must sound one long and
six short; the second wind, two short and one long; the third wind, one
long and two short.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
True, sir, it is a very good trade nowadays to be a villain; I am the
hound that hunts after a game unknown, and blows the villain.
                                                           [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Sir, I will bless your ears with a very pretty story: my father, out of
his own cost and charges, keeps an open table for all kind of dogs.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he keeps one more by thee.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMORETTO.
He hath your greyhound, your mongrel, your mastiff, your levrier, your
spaniel, your kennets, terriers, butchers' dogs, bloodhounds,
dunghill-dogs, trundle-tails, prick-eared curs, small ladies' puppies,
raches,[88] and bastards.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
What a bawdy knave hath he to his father, that keeps his Rachel, hath
his bastards, and lets his sons be plain ladies' puppies to bewray a
lady's chamber.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
It was my pleasure, two days ago, to take a gallant leash of greyhounds;
and into my father's park I went, accompanied with two or three noblemen
of my near acquaintance, desiring to show them some of the sport. I
caused the keeper to sever the rascal deer from the bucks of the first
head. Now, sir, a buck the first year is a fawn, the second year a
pricket, the third year a sorel, the fourth year a sore, the fifth a
buck of the first head, the sixth year a complete buck; as likewise your
hart is the first year a calf, the second year a brocket, the third year
a spade, the fourth year a stag, the fifth year a great stag, the sixth
year a hart; as likewise the roebuck is the first year a kid, the second
year a girl, the third year a hemuse: and these are your special beasts
for chase, or, as we huntsmen call it, for venery.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
If chaste be taken for venery, thou art a more special beast than any in
thy father's forest. [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.] Sir, I am sorry I have been so
troublesome to you.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
I know this was the readiest way to chase away the scholar, by getting
him into a subject he cannot talk of for his life. [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.] Sir, I
will borrow so much time of you as to finish this my begun story. Now,
sir, after much travel we singled a buck; I rode that same time upon a
roan gelding, and stood to intercept from the thicket; the buck broke
gallantly; my great swift being disadvantaged in his slip was at the
first behind; marry, presently coted and outstripped them, when as the
hart presently descended to the river, and being in the water, proffered
and reproffered, and proffered again: and, at last, he upstarted at the
other side of the water, which we call soil of the hart, and there other
huntsmen met him with an adauntreley;[89] we followed in hard chase for
the space of eight hours; thrice our hounds were at default, and then we
cried <emphasis>A slain</emphasis>! straight, <emphasis>So ho</emphasis>; through good reclaiming my faulty
hounds found their game again, and so went through the wood with gallant
noise of music, resembling so many <emphasis>viols de gambo</emphasis>. At last the hart
laid him down, and the hounds seized upon him; he groaned, and wept, and
died. In good faith, it made me weep too, to think of Actaeon's fortune,
which my Ovid speaks of—
                             [<emphasis>He reads Ovid</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Militat omnis amans, et habet sua castra Cupido</emphasis>.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, can you put me in any hope of obtaining my suit?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AMORETTO.
In good faith, sir, if I did not love you as my soul, I would not make
you acquainted with the mysteries of my art.</p>
<p>ACADEMICO.
Nay, I will not die of a discourse yet, if I can choose.
                                     [<emphasis>Exit unperceived</emphasis>.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
So, sir, when we had rewarded our dogs with the small guts, and the
lights, and the blood, the huntsmen hallooed, <emphasis>So ho! Venué</emphasis>, a coupler;
and so coupled the dogs, and then returned homeward. Another company of
hounds, that lay at advantage, had their couples cast off, and we might
hear the huntsmen cry, <emphasis>Horse, decouple, avant</emphasis>; but straight we heard
him cry, <emphasis>Le amond</emphasis>, and by that I knew that they had the hare, and on
foot; and by and by I might see sore and resore, prick and reprick.

<p>PAGE.
I wonder what is become of that Ovid <emphasis>de arte amandi</emphasis>.[90] My master, he
that for the practice of his discourse is wont to court his hobby abroad
and at home, in his chamber makes a set speech to his greyhound,
desiring that most fair and amiable dog to grace his company in a
stately galliard; and if the dog, seeing him practise his lusty points,
as his cross-point back-caper, chance to bewray the room, he presently
doft's his cap, most solemnly makes a low leg to his ladyship, taking it
for the greatest favour in the world that she would vouchsafe to leave
her civet-box or her sweet glove behind her.</p>
<p>    [<emphasis>Enter</emphasis> AMORETTO, <emphasis>reading Ovid</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>Not a word more. Sir, an't please you, your hobby will meet you at the
lane's end.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
What, Jack? i'faith, I cannot but vent unto thee a most witty jest of
mine.</p>
<p>PAGE.
I hope my master will not break wind. [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.] Will't please you, sir,
to bless mine ears with the discourse of it?</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Good faith, the boy begins to have an elegant smack of my style. Why,
then, thus it was, Jack, a scurvy mere Cambridge scholar, I know not
how to define him—</p>
<p>PAGE.
Nay, master, let me define a mere scholar. I heard a courtier once
define a mere scholar to be <emphasis>animal scabiosum</emphasis>, that is, a living
creature that is troubled with the itch; or, a mere scholar is a
creature that can strike fire in the morning at his tinder-box, put on
a pair of lined slippers, sit rheuming[91] till dinner, and then go to
his meat when the bell rings: one that hath a peculiar gift in a cough,
and a licence to spit. Or, if you will have him defined by negatives, he
is one that cannot make a good leg; one that cannot eat a mess of broth
cleanly; one that cannot ride a horse without spur-galling; one that
cannot salute a woman, and look on her directly; one that cannot—</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Enough, Jack; I can stay no longer; I am so great in childbirth with
this jest. Sirrah, this predicable, this saucy groom, because, when I
was in Cambridge, and lay in a trundlebed under my tutor, I was content,
in discreet humility, to give him some place at the table; and because I
invited the hungry slave sometimes to my chamber, to the canvassing of a
turkey-pie or a piece of venison which my lady grandmother sent me, he
thought himself therefore eternally possessed of my love, and came
hither to take acquaintance of me; and thought his old familiarity did
continue, and would bear him out in a matter of weight. I could not tell
how to rid myself better of the troublesome burr than by getting him
into the discourse of hunting; and then tormenting him a while with our
words of art, the poor scorpion became speechless, and suddenly
vanished![92] These clerks are simple fellows, simple fellows.
                                                   [<emphasis>He reads Ovid</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>PAGE.
Simple, indeed, they are; for they want your courtly composition of a
fool and of a knave. [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.] Good faith, sir, a most absolute jest;
but, methinks, it might have been followed a little further.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As how, my little knave?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PAGE.
Why thus, sir; had you invited him to dinner at your table, and have put
the carving of a capon upon him, you should have seen him handle the
knife so foolishly, then run through a jury of faces, then wagging his
head and showing his teeth in familiarity, venture upon it with the same
method that he was wont to untruss an apple-pie, or tyrannise an egg and
butter: then would I have applied him all dinner-time with clean
trenchers, clean trenchers; and still when he had a good bit of meat, I
would have taken it from him by giving him a clean trencher, and so have
served him in kindness.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
Well said, subtle Jack; put me in mind, when I return again, that I may
make my lady mother laugh at the scholar. I'll to my game; for you,
Jack, I would have you employ your time, till my coming, in watching
what hour of the day my hawk mutes.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>PAGE.
Is not this an excellent office, to be apothecary to his worship's hawk,
to sit scouting on the wall how the physic works? And is not my master
an absolute villain, that loves his hawk, his hobby, and his greyhound,
more than any mortal creature? Do but dispraise a feather of his hawk's
train, and he writhes his mouth, and swears (for he can do that only
with a good grace) that you are the most shallow-brained fellow that
lives. Do but say his horse stales with a good presence, and he's your
bondslave. When he returns, I'll tell twenty admirable lies of his hawk;
and then I shall be his little rogue and his white villain for a whole
week after. Well, let others complain; but I think there is no felicity
to the serving of a fool.</p>

Ay, and please your worship, sir.</p>

<p>

I will, an't please your worship.</p>

<p>SIR RADERIC.
And because I will be sure that I have conferred this kindness upon a
sufficient man, I have desired Master Recorder to take examination of
you.</p>
<p>PAGE.
My master, it seems, takes him for a thief; but he hath small reason for
it. As for learning, it's plain he never stole any; and for the living,
he knows himself how he comes by it; for let him but eat a mess of
furmenty this seven year, and yet he shall never be able to recover
himself. Alas, poor sheep, that hath fallen into the hands of such a
fox!    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
Good Master Recorder, take your place by me, and make trial of his
gifts: is the clerk there to record his examination? O, the page shall
serve the turn.</p>
<p>PAGE.
Trial of his gifts! never had any gifts a better trial: why, Immerito's
gifts have appeared in as many colours as the rainbow; first, to Master
Amoretto, in colour of the satin suit he wears: to my lady, in the
similitude of a loose gown: to my master, in the likeness of a silver
basin and ewer: to us pages, in the semblance of new suits and points.
So Master Amoretto plays the gull in a piece of a parsonage; my master
adorns his cupboard with a piece of a parsonage; my mistress, upon good
days, puts on a piece of a parsonage; and we pages play at blowpoint for
a piece of a parsonage: I think here's trial enough for one man's gifts.
                                                               [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>

<p>RECORDER.
In the next place, some art is requisite for the perfection of nature:
for the trial whereof, at the request of my worshipful friend, I will in
some sort propound questions fit to be resolved by one of your
profession. Say, what is a person that was never at the university?</p>
<p>IMMERITO.
A person that was never in the university is a living creature that can
eat a tithe-pig.</p>
<p>RECORDER.
Very well answered; but you should have added—and must be officious to
his patron. Write down that answer to show his learning in logic.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
Yea, boy, write that down. Very learnedly, in good faith. I pray now,
let me ask you one question that I remember: whether is the masculine
gender or the feminine more worthy?</p>
<p>IMMERITO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The feminine, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
The right answer, the right answer. In good faith, I have been of that
mind always. Write, boy, that to show he is a grammarian.</p>

Ay, we have taken an inventory of his good parts, and prized them
accordingly.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
Signior Immerito, forasmuch as we have made a double trial of thee—the
one of your learning, the other of your erudition—it is expedient also,
in the next place, to give you a few exhortations, considering the
greatest clerks are not the wisest men. This is therefore, first, to
exhort you to abstain from controversies; secondly, not to gird at men
of worship, such as myself, but to use yourself discreetly; thirdly, not
to speak when any man or woman coughs—do so, and in so doing, I will
persevere to be your worshipful friend and loving patron.</p>
<p>IMMERITO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I thank your worship, you have been the deficient cause of my preferment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
Lead Immerito into my son, and let him despatch him; and remember—my
tithes to be reserved, paying twelvepence a year. I am going to
Moorfields to speak with an unthrift I should meet at the Middle-Temple
about a purchase; when you have done, follow us.</p>

<p>    SIR RADERIC <emphasis>and</emphasis> RECORDER.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
Hark you, Master Recorder: I have fleshed my prodigal boy notably,
notably, in letting him deal for this living; that hath done him much
good, much good, I assure you.</p>
<p>RECORDER.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You do well, Sir Raderic, to bestow your living upon such an one as will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

be content to share, and on Sunday to say nothing; whereas your proud</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

university princox thinks he is a man of such merit the world cannot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

sufficiently endow him with preferment. An unthankful viper, an</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

unthankful viper, that will sting the man that revived him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, is't not strange to see a ragged clerk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some stamel weaver or some butcher's son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That scrubb'd a-late within a sleeveless gown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When the commencement, like a morris-dance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath put a bell or two about his legs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Created him a sweet clean gentleman;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How then he 'gins to follow fashions:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He, whose thin sire dwells in a smoky roof,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Must take tobacco, and must wear a lock;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His thirsty dad drinks in a wooden bowl,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But his sweet self is serv'd in silver plate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His hungry sire will scrape you twenty legs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For one good Christmas meal on New-Year's day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But his maw must be capon-cramm'd each day;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He must ere long be triple-beneficed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Else with his tongue he'll thunderbolt the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shake each peasant by his deaf man's ear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, had the world no wiser men than I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'd pen the prating parrots in a cage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A chair, a candle, and a tinder-box,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A thacked[96] chamber and a ragged gown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should be their lands and whole possessions;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Knights, lords, and lawyers should be lodg'd and dwell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within those over-stately heaps of stone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which doating sires in old age did erect.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, it were to be wished, that never a scholar in England might have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

above forty pound a year.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
Faith, Master Recorder, if it went by wishing, there should never an one
of them all have above twenty a year—a good stipend, a good stipend,
Master Recorder. I in the meantime, howsoever I hate them all deadly,
yet I am fain to give them good words. O, they are pestilent fellows,
they speak nothing but bodkins, and piss vinegar. Well, do what I can
in outward kindness to them, yet they do nothing but bewray my house:
as there was one that made a couple of knavish verses on my country
chimney, now in the time of my sojourning here at London; and it was
thus—
Sir Raderic keeps no chimney cavalier,
That takes tobacco above once a year.
And another made a couple of verses on my daughter, that learns to play
on the <emphasis>viol-de-gambo</emphasis>—
Her <emphasis>viol-de-gambo</emphasis> is her best content;
For 'twixt her legs she holds her instrument.
Very knavish, very knavish, if you look into it, Master Recorder. Nay,
they have played many a knavish trick beside with me. Well, 'tis a
shame, indeed, there should be any such privilege for proud beggars as
Cambridge and Oxford are. But let them go; and if ever they light in my
hands, if I do not plague them, let me never return home again to see
my wife's waiting-maid!</p>
<p>RECORDER.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This scorn of knights is too egregious:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But how should these young colts prove amblers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When the old, heavy, galled jades do trot?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There shall you see a puny boy start up,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make a theme against common lawyers;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then the old, unwieldy camels 'gin to dance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This fiddling boy playing a fit of mirth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The greybeards scrub, and laugh, and cry, <emphasis>Good, good!</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

To them again, boy; scourge the barbarians</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But we may give the losers leave to talk;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have the coin, then tell them laugh for me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet knights and lawyers hope to see the day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When we may share here their possessions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make indentures of their chaffer'd skins,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dice of their bones to throw in merriment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR RADERIC.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, good faith, Master Recorder, if I could see that day once?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>RECORDER.
Well, remember another day what I say: scholars are pryed into of late,
and are found to be busy fellows, disturbers of the peace. I'll say no
more; guess at my meaning. I smell a rat.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
I hope at length England will be wise enough, I hope so, i'faith; then
an old knight may have his wench in a corner without any satires or
epigrams. But the day is far spent, Master Recorder; and I fear by this
time the unthrift is arrived at the place appointed in Moorfields. Let
us hasten to him.    [<emphasis>He looks on his watch</emphasis>.</p>
<p>RECORDER.
Indeed, this day's subject transported us too late: [but] I think we

Sirrah boy, remember me when I come in Paul's Churchyard to buy a
Ronsard and [a] Dubartas in French, and Aretine in Italian; and our
hardest writers in Spanish; they will sharpen my wits gallantly. I do
relish these tongues in some sort. O, now I do remember, I hear a
report of a poet newly come out in Hebrew; it is a pretty harsh tongue,
and telleth[97] a gentleman traveller: but come, let's haste after my
father; the fields are fitter to heavenly meditations.

My masters, I could wish your presence at an admirable jest: why
presently this great linguist my master will march through Paul's
Churchyard, come to a bookbinder's shop, and with a big Italian look and
a Spanish face ask for these books in Spanish and Italian; then, turning
(through his ignorance) the wrong end of the book upward, use action on
this unknown tongue after this sort: First, look on the title, and
wrinkle his brow; next make as though he read the first page, and bite
's lip;[98] then with his nail score the margent, as though there were
some notable conceit; and, lastly, when he thinks he hath gulled the
standers-by sufficiently, throws the book away in a rage, swearing that
he could never find books of a true print since he was last in
Joadna;[99] inquire after the next mart, and so departs. And so must I;
for by this time his contemplation is arrived at his mistress's nose
end; he is as glad as if he had taken Ostend.[100] By this time he
begins to spit, and cry, Boy, carry my cloak: and now I go to attend on
his worship.</p>

corner here at London, and affect an old wench in a nook; one that loves
to live in a narrow room, that he may with more facility in the dark
light upon his wife's waiting-maid; one that loves alike a short sermon
and a long play; one that goes to a play, to a whore, to his bed, in
circle: good for nothing in the world but to sweat nightcaps and foul
fair lawn shirts, feed a few foggy servingmen, and prefer dunces to
livings—this old Sir Raderic, Furor, it shall be thy task to cudgel
with thy thick, thwart terms; marry, at the first, give him some

hound, and his mistress; one that more admires the good wrinkle of a
boot, the curious crinkling of a silk-stocking, than all the wit in the

half a day together his fly-blown sonnets of his mistress, and her
loving, pretty creatures, her monkey and her puppy.[104] It shall be thy

<p>SIR RADERIC.
Master Prodigo, Master Recorder hath told you law—your land is
forfeited; and for me not to take the forfeiture were to break the
Queen's law. For mark you, it's law to take the forfeiture; therefore
not to take[110] it is to break the Queen's law; and to break the
Queen's law is not to be a good subject, and I mean to be a good
subject. Besides, I am a justice of the peace; and, being justice of the
peace, I must do justice—that is, law—that is, to take the forfeiture,
especially having taken notice of it. Marry, Master Prodigo, here are a
few shillings over and besides the bargain.</p>
<p>PRODIGO.
Pox on your shillings! 'Sblood, a while ago, before he had me in the
lurch, who but my cousin Prodigo? You are welcome, my cousin Prodigo.
Take my cousin Prodigo's horse. A cup of wine for my cousin Prodigo.
Good faith, you shall sit here, good cousin Prodigo. A clean trencher
for my cousin Prodigo. Have a special care of my cousin Prodigo's
lodging. Now, Master Prodigo with a pox, and a few shillings for a
vantage. A plague on your shillings! Pox on your shillings! If it were
not for the sergeant, which dogs me at my heels, a plague on your
shillings! pox on your shillings! pox on yourself and your shillings!
pox on your worship! If I catch thee at Ostend—I dare not stay for the
sergeant.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

<p>AMORETTO'S PAGE.
He is a good liberal gentleman: he hath bestowed an ounce of tobacco
upon us; and, as long as it lasts, come cut and long tail, we'll spend
it as liberally for his sake.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC'S PAGE.
Come, fill the pipe quickly, while my master is in his melancholy
humour; it's just the melancholy of a collier's horse.</p>
<p>AMORETTO'S PAGE.
If you cough, Jack, after your tobacco, for a punishment you shall kiss
the pantofle.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
It's a foul oversight, that a man of worship cannot keep a wench in his
house, but there must be muttering and surmising. It was the wisest
saying that my father ever uttered, that a wife was the name of
necessity, not of pleasure; for what do men marry for, but to stock
their ground, and to have one to look to the linen, sit at the upper end
of the table, and carve up a capon; one that can wear a hood like a
hawk, and cover her foul face with a fan. But there's no pleasure
always to be tied to a piece of mutton; sometimes a mess of stewed broth
will do well, and an unlaced rabbit is best of all. Well, for mine own
part, I have no great cause to complain, for I am well-provided of three
bouncing wenches, that are mine own fee-simple; one of them I am
presently to visit, if I can rid myself cleanly of this company. Let me
see how the day goes [<emphasis>he pulls his watch out</emphasis>]. Precious coals! the
time is at hand; I must meditate on an excuse to be gone.</p>
<p>RECORDER.
The which, I say, is grounded on the statute I spake of before, enacted
in the reign of Henry VI.</p>
<p>AMORETTO.
It is a plain case, whereon I mooted[111] in our Temple, and that was
this: put case, there be three brethren, John a Nokes, John a Nash, and
John a Stile. John a Nokes the elder, John a Nash the younger, and John
a Stile the youngest of all. John a Nash the younger dieth without issue
of his body lawfully begotten. Whether shall his lands ascend to John a
Nokes the elder, or descend to John a Stile the youngest of all? The
answer is, the lands do collaterally descend, not ascend.</p>
<p>RECORDER.
Very true; and for a proof hereof I will show you a place in Littleton
which is very pregnant in this point.</p>

Nay, that's plain in Littleton; for if that fee-simple and fee-tail be
put together, it is called hotch-potch. Now, this word hotch-potch in
English is a pudding; for in such a pudding is not commonly one thing
only, but one thing with another.</p>

There is tail-general and tail-special, and Littleton is very copious in
that theme; for tail-general is when lands are given to a man and his
heirs of his body begotten; tail-special is when lands are given to a
man and to his wife, and to the heirs of their two bodies lawfully
begotten; and that is called tail-special.</p>
<p>SIR RADERIC.
Very well; and for his oath I will give a distinction. There is a
material oath and a formal oath; the formal oath may be broken, the
material may not be broken: for mark you, sir, the law is to take place
before the conscience, and therefore you may, using me your councillor,
cast him in the suit. There wants nothing to be full meaning of this
place.</p>

An excellent observation, in good faith. See how the old fox teacheth
the young cub to worry a sheep; or rather sits himself, like an old
goose, hatching the addle brain of Master Amoretto. There is no fool to
the satin fool, the velvet fool, the perfumed fool; and therefore the
witty tailors of this age put them under colour of kindness into a pair
of cloth bags, where a voider will not serve the turn. And there is no
knave to the barbarous knave, the moulting knave, the pleading
knave.—What, ho! Master Recorder? Master <emphasis>Noverint universi per

It's his meaning I should come off.[115] Why, here is the true style of
a villain, the true faith of a lawyer; it is usual with them to be
bribed on the one side, and then to take a fee of the other; to plead
weakly, and to be bribed and rebribed on the one side, then to be fee'd
and refee'd of the other; till at length, <emphasis>per varios casus</emphasis>, by putting
the case so often, they make their clients so lank, that they may case
them up in a comb-case, and pack them home from the term, as though they

It's true, indeed, honest Dick, but the slaves are somewhat proud; and

<p>Now for you. Methinks you should belong to my tuition; and your face,
methinks, would be good for a foolish mayor or a foolish justice of
peace. Mark me:—</p>
<p>Forasmuch as there be two states of a commonwealth, the one of peace,
the other of tranquillity; two states of war, the one of discord, the
other of dissension; two states of an incorporation, the one of the
aldermen, the other of the brethren; two states of magistrates, the one
of governing, the other of bearing rule. Now, as I said even now—for a
good thing[125] cannot be said too often. Virtue is the shoeing-horn of
justice; that is, virtue is the shoeing-horn of doing well; that is,
virtue is the shoeing-horn of doing justly; it behoveth me, and is my
part to commend this shoeing-horn unto you. I hope this word
shoeing-horn doth not offend any of you, my worshipful brethren; for
you, being the worshipful headsmen of the town, know well what the horn
meaneth. Now therefore I am determined not only to teach, but also to
instruct, not only the ignorant, but also the simple; not only what is
their duty towards their betters, but also what is their duty towards
their superiors.</p>

<p>

We've run[134] through many trades, yet thrive by none,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Poor in content, and only rich in moan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A shepherd's life, thou know'st I wont t'admire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Turning a Cambridge apple by the fire:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To live in humble dale we now are bent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Spending our days in fearless merriment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>STUDIOSO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'll teach each tree, ev'n of the hardest kind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To keep our woful name within their rind:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'll watch our flock, and yet we'll sleep withal:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'll tune our sorrows to the water's fall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The woods and rocks with our shrill songs we'll bless;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let them prove kind, since men prove pitiless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But say, whither are you and your company jogging? it seems by your</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

apparel you are about to wander.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>INGENIOSO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith we are fully bent to be lords of misrule in the world's wide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

heath: our voyage is to the Isle of Dogs, there where the blatant beast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

doth rule and reign, renting the credit of whom it please.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where serpents' tongues the penmen are to write,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where cats do wawl by day, dogs by night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There shall engorged venom be my ink,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My pen a sharper quill of porcupine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My stained paper this sin-loaden earth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There will I write in lines shall never die,</p>
<empty-line/>

Our seared lordings' crying villany.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>STUDIOSO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And well thou dost from this fond earth to flit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where most men's pens are hired parasites.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>

Go happily; I wish thee store of gall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sharply to wound the guilty world withal.</p>

When I arrive within the Isle of Dogs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dan Phoebus, I will make thee kiss the pump.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy one eye pries in every draper's stall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet never thinks on poet Furor's need.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Furor is lousy, great Furor lousy is;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll make thee rue[135] this lousy case, i-wis.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thou, my sluttish[136] laundress, Cynthia,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ne'er think'st on Furor's linen, Furor's shirt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou and thy squirting boy Endymion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lies slav'ring still upon a lawless couch.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Furor will have thee carted through the dirt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That mak'st great poet Furor want his shirt.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>PHANTASMA.
<emphasis>Canes timidi vehementius latrant</emphasis>. There are certain burrs in the Isle
of Dogs called, in our English tongue, men of worship; certain briars,

them. <emphasis>Quos ego—sed motos praestat componere fluctus</emphasis>.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>PHILOMUSUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We will be gone unto the downs of Kent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sure footing we shall find in humble dale;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our fleecy flock we'll learn to watch and ward,</p>

<p>

In July's heat, and cold of January.</p>
<empty-line/>

We'll chant our woes upon an oaten reed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whiles bleating flock upon their supper feed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>STUDIOSO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So shall we shun the company of men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That grows more hateful, as the world grows old.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'll teach the murm'ring brooks in tears to flow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And steepy rock to wail our passed woe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ACADEMICO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Adieu, you gentle spirits, long adieu;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your wits I love, and your ill-fortunes rue.</p>
<empty-line/>

I'll haste me to my Cambridge cell again;</p>

My fortunes cannot wax, but they may wain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>INGENIOSO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Adieu, good shepherds; happy may you live.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if hereafter in some secret shade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You shall recount poor scholars' miseries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Vouchsafe to mention with tear-swelling eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ingenioso's thwarting destinies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thou, still happy Academico,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That still may'st rest upon the muses' bed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enjoying there a quiet slumbering,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When thou repair'st[138] unto thy Granta's stream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wonder at thine own bliss, pity our case,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That still doth tread ill-fortune's endless maze;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wish them, that are preferment's almoners,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To cherish gentle wits in their green bud;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For had not Cambridge been to me unkind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I had not turn'd to gall a milky mind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHILOMUSUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I wish thee of good hap a plenteous store;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy wit deserves no less, my love can wish no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farewell, farewell, good Academico;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ne'er may'st thou taste of our fore-passed woe.</p>

We wish thy fortunes may attain their due.—</p>

Furor and you, Phantasma, both adieu,</p>

<emphasis>Et longum vale, inquit Iola</emphasis>.</p>
<p>FUROR.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farewell, my masters; Furor's a masty dog,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor can with a smooth glosing farewell cog.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nought can great Furor do but bark and howl,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And snarl, and grin, and carl, and touse the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a great swine, by his long, lean-ear'd lugs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farewell, musty, dusty, rusty, fusty London;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou art not worthy of great Furor's wit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That cheatest virtue of her due desert,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And suffer'st great Apollo's son to want.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>INGENIOSO.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, stay awhile, and help me to content</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So many gentle wits' attention,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who ken the laws of every comic stage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wonder that our scene ends discontent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ye airy wits subtle,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since that few scholars' fortunes are content,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wonder not if our scene ends discontent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When that your fortunes reach their due content,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then shall our scene end here in merriment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHILOMUSUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps some happy wit with seely[139] hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hereafter may record the pastoral</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the two scholars of Parnassus hill,</p>
<empty-line/>

And then our scene may end, and have content.</p>

Meantime, if there be any spiteful ghost,</p>

That smiles to see poor scholars' miseries,</p>

Cold is his charity, his wit too dull:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We scorn his censure, he's a jeering gull.</p>
<empty-line/>

But whatsoe'er refined sprites there be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That deeply groan at our calamity:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose breath is turn'd to sighs, whose eyes are wet,</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>A Pleasant Comedie, called Wily Begvilde. The Chiefe Actors be these:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A poore scholler, a rich Foole, and a Knaue at a shifte. At London,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Printed by H.L. for Clement Knight, and are to be solde at his Shop,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

in Paules Church-yard, at the signe of the Holy Lambe_. 1606. 4to.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[There were later editions in 1623, 1635, and 1638, all in 4to. That of
1606 is the most correct.</p>
<p>Hawkins, who included this piece in his collection, observes: "<emphasis>Wily
Beguiled</emphasis> is a regular and very pleasing Comedy; and if it were
judiciously adapted to the manners of the times, would make no
contemptible appearance on the modern stage."]</p>

<p><strong>SPECTRUM, THE PROLOGUE.</strong></p>
<p>What, ho! where are these paltry players? still poring in their papers,
and never perfect? For shame, come forth; your audience stay so long,
their eyes wax dim with expectation.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter one of the</emphasis> PLAYERS.</p>
<p>How now, my honest rogue? What play shall we have here to-night?</p>
<p>PLAYER.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, you may look upon the title.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PROLOGUE.
What, <emphasis>Spectrum</emphasis> once again? Why, noble Cerberus, nothing but patch-panel
stuff, old gallymawfries, and cotton-candle eloquence? Out, you bawling
bandog! fox-furred slave! you dried stock-fish, you, out of my sight!</p>

<p>Well, 'tis no matter! I'll sit me down and see it; and, for fault of a
better, I'll supply the place of a scurvy prologue.</p>
<p>        Spectrum is a looking-glass, indeed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wherein a man a history may read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of base conceits and damned roguery:</p>

<p>JUGGLER.
Why, how now, humorous George? What, as melancholy as a mantle-tree?
Will you see any tricks of legerdemain, sleight of hand, cleanly
conveyance, or <emphasis>deceptio visus</emphasis>? What will you see, gentleman, to drive
you out of these dumps.</p>
<p>PROLOGUE.
Out, you soused gurnet, you woolfist! Begone, I say, and bid the players
despatch, and come away quickly; and tell their fiery poet that, before
I have done with him I'll make him do penance upon a stage in a calf's
skin.</p>
<p>JUGGLER.
O Lord, sir, ye are deceived in me, I am no tale-carrier; I am a
juggler. I have the superficial skill of all the seven liberal sciences
at my fingers' end. I'll show you a trick of the twelves, and turn him
over the thumbs with a trice; I'll make him fly swifter than meditation.
I'll show you as many toys as there be minutes in a month, and as many
tricks as there be motes in the sun.</p>
<p>PROLOGUE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prythee, what tricks canst thou do?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUGGLER.
Marry, sir, I will show you a trick of cleanly conveyance—<emphasis>Hei, fortuna
furim nunquam credo</emphasis>—with a cast of clean conveyance. Come aloft, Jack,
for thy master's advantage. He's gone, I warrant ye.</p>
<p>     [SPECTRUM <emphasis>is conveyed away, and</emphasis> WILY BEGUILED
     <emphasis>stands in the place of it</emphasis>.</p>

<p><strong>PROLOGUE.</strong></p>
<p>Mass, and 'tis well done! Now I see thou canst do something. Hold thee;
there is twelvepence for thy labour.</p>
<p>Go to that barm-froth poet, and to him say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He quite hath lost the title of his play;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His calf-skin jests from hence are clean exil'd.</p>
<empty-line/>

Thus once you see, that Wily is beguil'd.</p>

You all are welcome to our author's play:</p>

<p>A heavy purse makes a light heart. O, the consideration of this pouch,
this pouch! Why, he that has money has heart's ease, and the world in a
string. O, this rich chink and silver coin! it is the consolation of the
world. I can sit at home quietly in my chair, and send out my angels by
sea and by land, and bid—<emphasis>Fly, villains, and fetch in ten in the
hundred</emphasis>. Ay, and a better penny too. Let me see: I have but two
children in all the world to bestow my goods upon—Fortunatus, my son,
and Lelia, my daughter. For my son, he follows the wars, and that which
he gets with swaggering he spends in swaggering. But I'll curb him; his
allowance, whilst I live, shall be small, and so he shall be sure not to
spend much: and if I die, I will leave him a portion that, if he will be
a good husband, and follow his father's steps, shall maintain him like a
gentleman, and if he will not, let him follow his own humour till he be
weary of it, and so let him go. Now for my daughter, she is my only joy,
and the staff of my age; and I have bestowed good bringing-up upon her,
by'r Lady. Why, she is e'en modesty itself; it does me good to look on
her. Now, if I can hearken out some wealthy marriage for her, I have my
only desire. Mass, and well-remembered: here's my neighbour Plod-all
hard by has but one only son; and let me see—I take it, his lands are
better than five thousand pounds. Now, if I can make a match between his
son and my daughter, and so join his land and my money together—O,
'twill be a blessed union. Well, I'll in, and get a scrivener: I'll
write to him about it presently. But stay, here comes Master Churms the
lawyer; I'll desire him to do so much.</p>

<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good morrow, Master Gripe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRIPE.
O, good morrow, Master Churms. What say my two debtors, that I lent two
hundred pound to? Will they not pay use and charges of suit?</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith, sir, I doubt they are bankrouts: I would you had your principal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRIPE.
Nay, I'll have all, or I'll imprison their bodies. But, Master Churms,
there is a matter I would fain have you do; but you must be very secret.</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O sir, fear not that; I'll warrant you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRIPE.
Why then, this it is: my neighbour Plod-all here by, you know, is a man
of very fair land, and he has but one son, upon whom he means to bestow
all that he has. Now I would make a match between my daughter Lelia and
him. What think you of it?</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Marry, I think 'twould be a good match. But the young man has had very
simple bringing-up.</p>
<p>GRIPE.
Tush! what care I for that? so he have lands and living enough, my
daughter has bringing up will serve them both. Now I would have you to
write me a letter to goodman Plod-all concerning this matter, and I'll
please you for your pains.</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll warrant you, sir; I'll do it artificially.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRIPE.
Do, good Master Churms; but be very secret. I have some business this
morning, and therefore I'll leave you a while; and if you will come to
dinner to me anon, you shall be very heartily welcome.</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Thanks, good sir; I'll trouble you. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> GRIPE.] Now 'twere a good
jest, if I could cosen the old churl of his daughter, and get the wench
for myself. Zounds, I am as proper a man as Peter Plod-all: and though
his father be as good a man as mine, yet far-fetched and dear-bought is
good for ladies; and, I am sure, I have been as far as Cales[141] to
fetch that I have. I have been at Cambridge, a scholar; at Cales, a
soldier; and now in the country a lawyer; and the next degree shall be a
coneycatcher: for I'll go near to cosen old father share-penny[142] of
his daughter; I'll cast about, I'll warrant him: I'll go dine with him,
and write him his letter; and then I'll go seek out my kind companion
Robin Goodfellow: and, betwixt us, we'll make her yield to anything.
We'll ha' the common law o' the one hand, and the civil law o' the
other: we'll toss Lelia like a tennis-ball.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

Ah, tenant, an ill-husband, by'r Lady: thrice at thy house, and never at
home? You know my mind: will you give ten shillings more rent? I must
discharge you else.</p>

Alas! landlord, will you undo me! I sit of a great rent already, and am
very poor.</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Very poor? you're a very ass. Lord, how my stomach wambles at the same
word <emphasis>very poor</emphasis>! Father, if you love your son William, never name that
same word, <emphasis>very poor</emphasis>; for, I'll stand to it, that it's petty larceny
to name <emphasis>very poor</emphasis> to a man that's o' the top of his marriage.</p>
<p>OLD MAN.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, son, art o' the top of thy marriage? To whom, I prythee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Marry, to pretty Peg, Mistress Lelia's nurse's daughter. O, 'tis the
dapp'rest wench that ever danced after a tabor and pipe—</p>
<p>            For she will so heel it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And toe it, and trip it;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O, her buttocks will quake like a custard.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, William, when were you with her?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
O Peter, does your mouth water at that? Truly, I was never with her; but
I know I shall speed: 'for t'other day she looked on me and laughed, and
that's a good sign, ye know. And therefore, old Silver-top, never talk
of charging or discharging: for I tell you, I am my father's heir; and
if you discharge me, I'll discharge my pestilence at you: for to let my
house before my lease be out, is cut-throatery; and to scrape for more
rent, is poll-dennery;[143] and so fare you well, good grandsire Usury.
Come, father, let's be gone.</p>
<p>                                       [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> WILL <emphasis>and his father</emphasis>.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CHURMS <emphasis>with a letter</emphasis>.</p>
<p>But stay, here comes one. O, 'tis Master Churms: I hope he brings me
some good news. Master Churms, you're well-met; I am e'en almost starved
for money: you must take some damnable course with my tenants; they'll
not pay.</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Faith, sir, they are grown to be captious knaves: but I'll move them
with a <emphasis>habeas corpus</emphasis>.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.
Do, good Master Churms, or use any other villanous course shall please
you. But what news abroad?</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Faith, little news; but here's a letter which Master Gripe desired me to
deliver you: and though it stand not with my reputation to be a carrier
of letters, yet, not knowing how much it might concern you, I thought it
better something to abase myself, than you should be anyways hindered.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>

Thanks, good sir; and I'll in and read it.</p>

And mantled round in sweet nymph Flora's robes:</p>

<p>

Here grows th'alluring rose, sweet marigolds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the lovely hyacinth. Come, nurse, gather:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A crown of roses shall adorn my head,</p>

I'll prank myself with flowers of the prime;</p>

A good one, quotha? ha, ha, ha, ha! why, woman, I heard your father say
that he would marry you to Peter Plod-all, that puck-fist, that

meat and drink to me to see how the fool would woo you.</p>

Whose love is lock'd in Lelia's tender breast:</p>

This heart hath vow'd, if heav'ns do not deny,</p>

<p>

My love with his entomb'd in earth shall lie.</p>

<emphasis>Optatis non est spes ulla potiri</emphasis>.</p>

Yet, Phoebus, send down thy tralucent beams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold the earth that mourns in sad attire;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The flowers at Sophos' presence 'gin to droop,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose trickling tears for Lelia's loss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do turn the plains into a standing pool.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet Cynthia, smile, cheer up the drooping flowers;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let Sophos once more see a sunshine-day:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, let the sacred centre of my heart—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I mean fair Lelia, nature's fairest work—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be once again the object to mine eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, but I wish in vain, whilst her I wish to see:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her father he obscures her from my sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He pleads my want of wealth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And says it is a bar in Venus' court.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How hath fond fortune by her fatal doom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Predestin'd me to live in hapless hopes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Still turning false her fickle, wavering wheel!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And love's fair goddess with her Circian cup</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enchanteth so fond Cupid's poison'd darts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That love, the only loadstar of my life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth draw my thoughts into a labyrinth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But stay:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What do I see? what do mine eyes behold?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O happy sight! It is fair Lelia's face!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hail, heav'n's bright nymph, the period of my grief,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sole guidress of my thoughts, and author of my joy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet Sophos, welcome to Lelia;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fair Dido, Carthaginians' beauteous queen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not half so joyful was, when as the Trojan prince</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Aeneas landed on the sandy shores</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Carthage' confines, as thy Lelia is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To see her Sophos here arriv'd by chance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bless'd be chance, that hath conducted me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto the place where I might see my dear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As dear to me as is the dearest life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, you may see that fortune is your friend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet fortune favours fools.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By that conclusion you should not be wise.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Foul fortune sometimes smiles on virtue fair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis then to show her mutability:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But since, amidst ten thousand frowning threats</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of fickle fortune's thrice-unconstant wheel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She deigns to show one little pleasing smile,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let's do our best false fortune to beguile,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And take advantage of her ever-changing moods.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See, see, how Tellus' spangled mantle smiles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And birds do chant their rural sugar'd notes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As ravish'd with our meeting's sweet delights:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since then, there fits for love both time and place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let love and liking hand in hand embrace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
Sir, the next way to win her love is to linger her leisure. I measure my
mistress by my lovely self: make a promise to a man, and keep it. I have
but one fault—I ne'er made promise in my life, but I stick to it tooth
and nail. I'll pay it home, i' faith. If I promise my love a kiss, I'll
give him two; marry, at first I will make nice, and cry <emphasis>Fie, fie</emphasis>; and
that will make him come again and again. I'll make him break his wind
with come-agains.</p>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But what says Lelia to her Sophos' love?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ah, Sophos, that fond blind boy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That wrings these passions from my Sophos' heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath likewise wounded Lelia with his dart;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And force perforce, I yield the fortress up:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here, Sophos, take thy Lelia's hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with this hand receive a loyal heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

High Jove, that ruleth heaven's bright canopy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grant to our love a wish'd felicity!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As joys the weary pilgrim by the way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When Phoebus wanes[144] unto the western deep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To summon him to his desired rest;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or as the poor distressed mariner,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Long toss'd by shipwreck on the foaming waves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At length beholds the long-wish'd haven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Although from far his heart doth dance for joy:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So love's consent at length my mind hath eas'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My troubled thoughts by sweet content are pleas'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father recks not virtue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But vows to wed me to a man of wealth:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And swears his gold shall counterpoise his worth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Lelia scorns proud Mammon's golden mines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And better likes of learning's sacred lore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than of fond fortune's glistering mockeries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, Sophos, try thy wits, and use thy utmost skill</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To please my father, and compass his goodwill.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To what fair Lelia wills doth Sophos yield content;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet that's the troublous gulf my silly ship must pass:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, were that venture harder to atchieve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than that of Jason for the golden fleece,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would effect it for sweet Lelia's sake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or leave myself as witness of my thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How say you by that, mistress? He'll do anything for your sake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thanks, gentle love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, lest my father should suspect—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose jealous head with more than Argus' eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth measure ev'ry gesture that I use—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll in, and leave you here alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Adieu, sweet friend, until we meet again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, nurse, follow me.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Farewell, my love, fair fortune be thy guide!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, Sophos, now bethink thyself, how thou</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May'st win her father's will to knit this happy knot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! thy state is poor, thy friends are few.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fear forbids to tell my fate to friends:[145]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, I'll try my fortunes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And find out some convenient time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When as her father's leisure best shall serve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To confer with him about fair Lelia's love.</p>

Neighbour Plod-all, I sent a letter to you by Master Churms; how like
you of the motion?</p>

Marry, I like well of the motion. My son, I tell you, is e'en all the
stay I have, and all my care is to have him take one that hath
something, for, as the world goes now, if they have nothing, they may
beg. But I doubt he's too simple for your daughter; for I have brought
him up hardly, with brown bread, fat bacon, puddings, and souse; and,
by'r Lady, we think it good fare too.</p>

Prythee, peace, Will! Neighbour Plod-all, what say you to this match?
shall it go forward?</p>

Sir, that must be as our children like. For my son, I think I can rule
him; marry, I doubt your daughter will hardly like of him; for, God wot,
he's very simple.</p>
<p>GRIPE.
My daughter's mine to command; have I not brought her up to this? She
shall have him. I'll rule the roost for that. I'll give her pounds and
crowns, gold and silver. I'll weigh her down in pure angel gold. Say,
man, is't a match?</p>

Yes, marry, that I will, and we'll desire your help for conveyance.</p>

But, landlord, I can tell you news, i' faith. There is one Sophos, a

<p>

But I am sure she loves him not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Nay, I dare take it on my death she loves him, for he's a scholar, and
'ware scholars! they have tricks for love, i' faith; for with a little
logic and <emphasis>Pitome colloquium</emphasis> they'll make a wench do anything.
Landlord, pray ye, be not angry with me for speaking my conscience. In
good faith, your son Peter's a very clown to him. Why, he's as fine a
man as a wench can see in a summer's day.</p>
<p>GRIPE.
Well, that shall not serve his turn; I'll cross him, I warrant ye. I am
glad I know it. I have suspected it a great while. Sophos! Why, what's
Sophos? a base fellow. Indeed he has a good wit, and can speak well.
He's a scholar, forsooth—one that hath more wit than money—and I like
not that; he may beg, for all that. Scholars! why, what are scholars
without money?</p>

<p>A horn plague of this money, for it causeth many horns to bud; and for
money many men are horned; for when maids are forced to love where they
like not, it makes them lie where they should not. I'll be hanged, if
e'er Mistress Lelia will ha' Peter Plod-all; I swear by this button-cap
(do you mark?), and by the round, sound, and profound contents (do you
understand?) of this costly codpiece (being a good proper man, as you
see), that I could get her as soon as he myself. And if I had not a
month's mind in another place, I would have a fling at her, that's flat;
but I must set a good holiday-face on't, and go a wooing to pretty Peg:
well, I'll to her, i' faith, while 'tis in my mind. But stay; I'll see
how I can woo before I go: they say use makes perfectness. Look you now;
suppose this were Peg: now I set my cap o' the side on this fashion (do
ye see?); then say I, sweet honey, honey, sugar-candy Peg.</p>

begin to commend her beauty, and then I will tell her plainly that I am
in love with her over my high shoes; and then I will tell her that I do
nothing of nights but sleep, and think on her, and specially of mornings:
and that does make my stomach so rise, that I'll be sworn I can turn me
three or four bowls of porridge over in a morning afore breakfast.</p>

<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
Mass, the fellow was afraid. I play the bugbear wheresoe'er I come, and
make them all afraid. But here comes Master Churms.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CHURMS.</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Fellow Robin, God save you: I have been seeking for you in every
alehouse in the town.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
What, Master Churms? What's the best news abroad? 'tis long since I
see you.</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Faith, little news: but yet I am glad I have met with you. I have a
matter to impart to you wherein you may stand me in some stead, and make
a good benefit to yourself: if we can deal cunningly, 'twill be worth a
double fee to you, by the Lord.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A double fee? speak, man; what is't? If it be to betray mine own father,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll do it for half a fee; and for cunning let me alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.
Why then, this it is: here is Master Gripe hard by, a client of mine, a
man of mighty wealth, who has but one daughter; her dowry is her weight
in gold. Now, sir, this old pennyfather would marry her to one Peter
Plod-all, rich Plod-all's son and heir; whom though his father means to
leave very rich, yet he's a very idiot and brownbread clown, and one I
know the wench does deadly hate: and though their friends have given
their full consent, and both agreed on this unequal match, yet I know
that Lelia will never marry him. But there's another rival in her
love—one Sophos; and he's a scholar, one whom I think fair Lelia dearly
loves, but her father hates him as he hates a toad; for he's in want,
and Gripe gapes after gold, and still relies upon the old-said saw, <emphasis>Si
nihil attuleris</emphasis>, &amp;c.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wherein can I do you any good in this?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.
Marry, thus, sir: I am of late grown passing familiar with Master Gripe;
and for Plod-all, he takes me for his second self. Now, sir, I'll fit
myself to the old crummy churls' humours, and make them believe I'll
persuade Lelia to marry Peter Plod-all, and so get free access to the
wench at my pleasure. Now, o' the other side, I'll fall in with the
scholar, and him I'll handle cunningly too; I'll tell him that Lelia has
acquainted me with her love to him, and for
Because her father much suspects the same,
He mews her up as men do mew their hawks;
And so restrains her from her Sophos' sight.
I'll say, because she doth repose more trust
Of secrecy in me than in another man,
In courtesy she hath requested me
To do her kindest greetings to her love.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An excellent device, i' faith!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.
Ay, sir, and by this means I'll make a very gull of my fine Diogenes: I
shall know his secrets even from the very bottom of his heart. Nay more,
sir; you shall see me deal so cunningly, that he shall make me an
instrument to compass his desire; when, God knows, I mean nothing less.
<emphasis>Qui dissimulare nescit, nescit vivere</emphasis>.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
Why, this will be sport alone; but what would you have me do in this
action?</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Marry, as I play with th'one hand, play you with t'other. Fall you
aboard with Peter Plod-all; make him believe you'll work miracles, and
that you have a powder will make Lelia love him. Nay, what will he not
believe, and take all that comes? you know my mind: and so we'll make a
gull of the one and a goose of the other. And if we can invent any
device to bring the scholar in disgrace with her, I do not doubt but
with your help to creep between the bark and the tree, and get Lelia
myself.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
Tush! man. I have a device in my head already to do that. But they say
her brother Fortunatus loves him dearly.</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Tut! he's out of the country; he follows the drum and the flag. He may
chance to be killed with a double cannon before he come home again. But
what's your device?</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
Marry, I'll do this: I'll frame an indictment against Sophos in manner
and form of a rape, and the next law-day you shall prefer it, that so
Lelia may loath him, her father still deadly hate him, and the young
gallant her brother utterly forsake him.</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But how shall we prove it?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Zounds, we'll hire some strumpet or other to be sworn against him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.
Now, by the substance of my soul, 'tis an excellent device. Well, let's
in. I'll first try my cunning otherwise, and if all fail, we'll try this
conclusion.

Marry, sir, I hear you're a very cunning man, sir, and sir reverence of
your worship, sir, I am going a-wooing to one Mistress Lelia, a
gentlewoman here hard by. Pray ye, sir, tell me how I should behave
myself, to get her to my wife, for, sir, there is a scholar about her;
now, if you can tell me how I should wipe his nose of her, I would
bestow a fee of you.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
Let me see't, and thou shalt see what I'll say to thee. [<emphasis>He gives him
money</emphasis>.] Well, follow my counsel, and, I'll warrant thee, I'll give thee
a love-powder for thy wench, and a kind of <emphasis>nux vomica</emphasis> in a potion
shall make her come off, i' faith.</p>

Shall I trouble you so far as to take some pains with me? I am loth to
have the dodge.</p>

Tush! fear not the dodge. I'll rather put on my flashing red nose and my
flaming face, and come wrapped in a calf's skin, and cry <emphasis>Bo bo</emphasis>. I'll
fray the scholar, I warrant thee. But first go to her, try what thou
canst do; perhaps she'll love thee without any further ado. But thou
must tell her thou hast a good stock, some hundred or two a year, and
that will set her hard, I warrant thee; for, by the mass, I was once in
good comfort to have cosened a wench, and wott'st thou what I told her?
I told her I had a hundred pound land a year in a place, where I have
not the breadth of my little finger. I promised her to enfeoff her in
forty pounds a year of it, and I think of my conscience, if I had had
but as good a face as thine, I should have made her have cursed the time
that ever she see it. And thus thou must do: crack and lie, and face,
and thou shalt triumph mightily.</p>

I need not do so, for I may say, and say true, I have lands and living
enough for a country fellow.</p>

By'r Lady, so had not I. I was fain to overreach, as many times I do;
but now experience hath taught me so much craft that I excel in cunning.</p>

Well, sir, then I'll be bold to trust to your cunning, and so I'll bid
you farewell, and go forward. I'll to her, that's flat.</p>

take her choice, yet I must confess I love Lelia.</p>

Sir, I must be plain with you. I like not of your love. Lelia's mine.
I'll choose for Lelia, and therefore I would wish you not to frequent my
house any more. It's better for you to ply your book, and seek for some
preferment that way, than to seek for a wife before you know how to
maintain her.</p>

<empty-line/>

Why, how now, mistress? what, is it love that makes you weep, and toss,
and turn so a-nights, when you are in bed? Saint Leonard grant you fall
not love-sick.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ay, that's the point that pierceth to the quick.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would Atropos would cut my vital thread,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so make lavish of my loathed life:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or gentle heav'ns would smile with fair aspect,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so give better fortunes to my love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, is't not a plague to be a prisoner to mine own father?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, and 't's a shame for him to use you so too:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But be of good cheer, mistress; I'll go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Sophos ev'ry day; I'll bring you tidings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tokens too from him, I'll warrant ye;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if he'll send you a kiss or two, I'll bring it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me alone; I am good at a dead lift:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, I cannot blame you for loving of Sophos;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, he's a man as one should picture him in wax.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, mistress—out upon's! wipe your eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>

For here comes another wooer.</p>

<p>

Mistress Lelia, God speed you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>

That's more than we</p>
<empty-line/>

Need at this time, for we are doing nothing.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twere as good say a good word as a bad.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>

But it's more wisdom to say nothing at all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than speak to no purpose.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

My purpose is to wive you.</p>

And mine is never to wed you.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Belike, you are in love with somebody else.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
No, but she's lustily promised. Hear you—you with [the] long rifle by
your side—do you lack a wife?</p>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Call ye this [a] rifle? it's a good backsword.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>

<p>

Why, then, you with [the] backsword, let's see your back.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, I must speak with Mistress Lelia Before I go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What would you with me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
Marry, I have heard very well of you, and so has my father too; and he
has sent me to you a-wooing; and if you have any mind of marriage, I
hope I shall maintain you as well as any husbandman's wife in the
country.</p>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Maintain her? with what?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, with my lands and livings my father has promised me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have heard much of your wealth, but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I never knew you manners before now.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
Faith, I have no manors, but a pretty home-stall; and we have great
store of oxen and horses, and carts and ploughs and household-stuff
'bomination, and great flocks of sheep, and flocks of geese and capons,
and hens and ducks. O, we have a fine yard of pullen! And, thank God,
here's a fine weather for my father's lambs.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot live content in discontent:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For as no music can delight the ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where all the parts of discords are composed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So wedlock-bands will still consist in jars,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where in condition there's no sympathy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then rest yourself contented with this answer—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
It's no matter what you say: for my father told me thus much before I
came, that you would be something nice at first; but he bad me like you
ne'er the worse for that, for I were the liker to speed.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then you were best leave off your suit till</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some other time: and when my leisure serves me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To love you, I'll send you word.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
Will you? well then I'll take my leave of you; and if I may hear from
you, I'll pay the messenger well for his pains. But stay—God's death! I
had almost forgot myself! pray ye, let me kiss your hand, ere I go.</p>
<p>NURSE.
Faith, mistress, his mouth runs a-water for a kiss; a little would serve
his turn, belike: let him kiss your hand.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>

I'll not stick for that.    [<emphasis>He kisseth her hand</emphasis>.</p>

Thus lucre's set in golden chair of state,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When learning's bid stand by, and keeps aloof:</p>

This greedy humour fits my father's vein,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who gapes for nothing but for golden gain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CHURMS.</p>
<p>NURSE.
Mistress, take heed you speak nothing that will bear action, for here
comes Master Churms the pettifogger.</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Mistress Lelia, rest you merry: what's the reason you and your nurse
walk here alone?</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because, sir, we desire no other company but our own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would I were then your own, that I might keep you company.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

O sir, you and he that is her own are far asunder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But if she please, we may be nearer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That cannot be; mine own is nearer than myself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet myself, alas! am not mine own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thoughts, fears, despairs, ten thousand dreadful dreams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those are mine own, and those do keep me company.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before God,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I must confess, your father is too cruel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To keep you thus sequester'd from the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To spend your prime of youth thus in obscurity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seek to wed you to an idiot fool,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That knows not how to use himself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could my deserts but answer my desires,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I swear by Sol, fair Phoebus' silver eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart would wish no higher to aspire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than to be grac'd with Lelia's love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By Jesus, I cannot play the dissembler,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And woo my love with courting ambages,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like one whose love hangs on his smooth tongue's end;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, in a word, I tell the sum of my desires,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I love fair Lelia:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By her my passions daily are increas'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I must die, unless by Lelia's love they be releas'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.
Why, Master Churms, I had thought that you had been my father's great
councillor in all these actions.</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, damn me, if I be: by heav'ns, sweet nymph, I am not!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
Master Churms, you are one can do much with her father: and if you love
as you say, persuade him to use her more kindly, and give her liberty to
take her choice; for these made marriages prove not well.</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I protest I will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So Lelia shall accept thee as her friend:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Meanwhile, nurse, let's in:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My long absence, I know, will make my father muse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                        [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> LELIA and NURSE.</p>
<p>CHURMS.
<emphasis>So Lelia shall accept thee as her friend</emphasis>:—who can but ruminate upon
these words? Would she had said, her love: but 'tis no matter; first
creep, and then go; now her friend: the next degree is Lelia's love.
Well, I'll persuade her father to let her have a little more liberty.
But soft; I'll none of that neither: so the scholar may chance cosen me.
Persuade him to keep her in still: and before she'll have Peter
Plod-all, she'll have anybody; and so I shall be sure that Sophos shall
never come at her. Why, I'll warrant ye, she'll be glad to run away with
me at length. Hang him that has no shifts. I promised Sophos to further
him in his suit; but if I do, I'll be pecked to death with hens. I swore
to Gripe I would persuade Lelia to love Peter Plod-all; but, God forgive
me, 'twas the furthest end of my thought. Tut! what's an oath? every man
for himself: I'll shift for one, I warrant ye.

And wafted safe from Mars his bloody fields,</p>

Where trumpets sound tantara to the fight,</p>

And here arriv'd for to repose myself</p>
<empty-line/>

Upon the borders of my native soil.</p>

Now, Fortunatus, bend thy happy course</p>

Unto thy father's house, to greet thy dearest friends;</p>
<empty-line/>

And if that still thy aged sire survive,</p>

Thy presence will revive his drooping spirits,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cause his wither'd cheeks be sprent with youthful blood,</p>

Where death of late was portray'd to the quick.</p>

But, soft; who comes here?    [<emphasis>Stand aside</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
I wonder I hear not of Master Churms; I would fain know how he speeds,
and what success he has in Lelia's love. Well, if he cosen the scholar
of her, 'twould make my worship laugh; and if he have her, he may
say,—Godamercy, Robin Goodfellow: O, ware a good head as long as you
live. Why, Master Gripe, he casts beyond the moon, and Churms is the
only man he puts in trust with his daughter; and, I'll warrant, the old
churl would take it upon his salvation that he will persuade her to
marry Peter Plod-all. But I will make a fool of Peter Plod-all; I'll
look him in the face, and pick his purse, whilst Churms cosen him of his
wench, and my old grandsire Holdfast of his daughter: and if he can do
so, I'll teach him a trick to cosen him of his gold too. Now, for
Sophos, let him wear the willow garland, and play the melancholy
malcontent, and pluck his hat down in his sullen eyes, and think on
Lelia in these desert groves: 'tis enough for him to have her in his
thoughts, although he ne'er embrace her in his arms. But now there's a
fine device comes into my head to scare the scholar: you shall see, I'll
make fine sport with him. They say that every day he keeps his walk
amongst these woods and melancholy shades, and on the bark of every
senseless tree engraves the tenor of his hapless hope. Now when he's at
Venus' altar at his orisons, I'll put me on my great carnation-nose, and
wrap me in a rowsing calf-skin suit, and come like some hobgoblin, or
some devil ascended from the grisly pit of hell, and like a scarbabe
make him take his legs: I'll play the devil, I warrant ye.</p>

And if you do, by this hand, I'll play the conjuror.</p>

<p>

Blush, Fortunatus, at the base conceit!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To stand aloof, like one that's in a trance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with thine eyes behold that miscreant imp,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose tongue['s] more venom['s] than the serpent's sting,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before thy face thus taunt thy dearest friends—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ay, thine own father—with reproachful terms!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy sister Lelia, she is bought and sold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And learned Sophos, thy thrice-vowed friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is made a stale by this base cursed crew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And damned den of vagrant runagates:</p>

But here, in sight of sacred heav'ns, I swear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By all the sorrows of the Stygian souls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By Mars his bloody blade, and fair Bellona's bowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I vow, these eyes shall ne'er behold my father's face,</p>
<empty-line/>

These feet shall never pass these desert plains;</p>

But pilgrim-like, I'll wander in these woods,</p>

Until I find out Sopho's secret walks.</p>

And sound the depth of all their plotted drifts.</p>

Lelia bid him welcome too, ere I ha' done with her. Come, Peter, follow
us.

<p>CHURNS.
Why, this is excellent: better and better still. This is beyond
expectation; why, now this gear begins to work. But, beshrew my heart, I
was afraid that Lelia would have yielded. When I saw her father take her
by the hand and call me for a witness, my heart began to quake; but, to
say the truth, she had little reason to take a cullian lug-loaf, milksop
slave, when she may have a lawyer, a gentleman that stands upon his
reputation in the country, one whose diminutive defect of law may
compare with his little learning. Well, I see that Churms must be the
man must carry Lelia, when all's done.</p>

How now, Master Churms? What news abroad? Methinks you look very spruce;

Faith, Lelia has e'en given him the doff[148] here, and has made her
father almost stark-mad.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
O, all the better; then I shall be sure of more of his custom. But what
success have you in your suit with her?</p>
<p>CHURMS.
Faith, all hitherto goes well. I have made the motion to her, but as yet
we are grown to no conclusion. But I am in very good hope.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But do you think you shall get her father's goodwill?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.
Tut, if I get the wench, I care not for that; that will come afterward;
and I'll be sure of something in the meantime, for I have outlawed a
great number of his debtors, and I'll gather up what money I can amongst
them, and Gripe shall never know of it neither.</p>

Ay, and of those that are scarce able to pay, take the one half, and
forgive them the other, rather than sit out at all.</p>

Tush! let me alone for that; but, sirrah, I have brought the scholar</p>

I'll attire myself fit for the same purpose,</p>

Like to some hellish hag or damned fiend,</p>

These cypress shades are witness of my woes;</p>

The senseless trees do grieve at my laments;</p>

And here lies wrapp'd in labyrinths of love—</p>

Of his sweet Lelia's love, whose sole idea still</p>

Prolongs the hapless date of Sophos' hopeless life.</p>

Than death? ay, than ten thousand deaths.</p>

Whose absence makes warm blood drop from my heart,</p>

And forceth wat'ry tears from these my weeping eyes.</p>

With gentle murmur summon me to sleep,</p>

Singing a sweet, melodious lullaby.</p>

Hath sorrow lately blear'd thy wat'ry eyes,</p>

That thou forgett'st the lasting league of love,</p>

Long since was vowed betwixt thyself and me?</p>

By Boreas' bitter blast and Ae'lus' whistling winds,</p>

As Lelia's love,</p>

The lofty eagle will not catch at flies.</p>

Denies my course, and sears my waxen wings,</p>

Nurse, what news? How fares my love?</p>

<p>NURSE.
How fares she, quotha? marry, she may fare how she will for you. Neither
come to her nor send to her of a whole fortnight! Now I swear to you by
my maidenhead, if my husband should have served me so when he came a
wooing me, I would never have looked on him with a good face, as long as
I had lived. But he was as kind a wretch as ever laid lips of a woman:
he would a'come through the windows, or doors, or walls, or anything,
but he would have come to me. Marry, after we had been married a while,
his kindness began to slack, for I'll tell you what he did: he made me
believe he would go to Green-goose fair; and I'll be sworn he took his
legs, and ran clean away. And I am afraid you'll prove e'en such another
kind piece to my mistress; for she sits at home in a corner weeping for
you: and, I'll be sworn, she's ready to die upward for you. And her
father o' the other side, he yawls at her, and jawls at her; and she
leads such a life for you, it passes: and you'll neither come to her,
nor send to her. Why, she thinks you have forgotten her.</p>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, then let heav'ns in sorrow end my days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fatal fortune never cease to frown:</p>

<p>

And heav'n and earth, and all conspire to pull me down,</p>
<empty-line/>

If black oblivion seize upon my heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Once to estrange my thoughts from Lelia's love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, nurse, I am sure that Lelia hears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Sophos once a day at least by Churms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The lawyer, who is his only friend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
What, young master! God bless mine eyesight. Now, by my maidenhead,
y'are welcome home: I am sure my mistress will be glad to see you. But
what said you of Master Churms?</p>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, I say he's a well-wisher to my sister Lelia,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And a secret friend to Sophos.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
Marry, the devil he is! trust him, and hang him. Why, he cannot speak a
good word on him to my old master; and he does so ruffle before my
mistress with his barbarian eloquence,[153] and strut before her in a
pair of Polonian legs, as if he were a gentleman-usher to the great Turk
or to the devil of Dowgate. And if my mistress would be ruled by him,
Sophos might go snick-up: but he has such a butter-milk face, that
she'll never have him.</p>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can falsehood lurk in those enticing looks!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And deep dissemblance lie, where truth appears?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Injurious villain, to betray his friend!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, do you know the gentleman?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith, not well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, sir, he looks like a red herring at a nobleman's table on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Easter-day, and he speaks nothing but almond-butter and sugarcandy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That's excellent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This world's the chaos of confusion;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No world at all, but mass of open wrongs,</p>
<empty-line/>

Wherein a man, as in a map, may see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The highroad way from woe to misery.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Content yourself, and leave these passions:</p>

The devil's[154] device and Churms his knavery;</p>

On whom this heart hath vow'd to be reveng'd.</p>

I'll scatter them: the plot's already in my head.</p>

<p>

Nurse, hie thee home, commend me to my sister;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bid her this night send for Master Churms:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him she must recount her many griefs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Exclaim against her father's hard constraint, and so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cunningly temporise with this cunning Catso,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That he may think she loves him as her life;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bid her tell him that, if by any means</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He can convey her forth her father's gate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto a secret friend of hers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The way to whom lies by this forest-side;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That none but he shall have her to his bride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For her departure let her 'ppoint the time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To-morrow night, when Vesper 'gins to shine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here will I be when Lelia comes this way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Accompani'd with her gentleman-usher,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose am'rous thoughts do dream on nought but love:</p>
<empty-line/>

And if this bastinado hold, I'll make</p>

<p>

Him leave his wench with Sophos for a pawn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me alone to use him in his kind;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This is the trap which for him I have laid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus craft by cunning once shall be betray'd:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, for the devil,[155] I will conjure him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good nurse, begone; bid her not fail:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for a token bear to her this ring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which well she knows; for, when I saw her last,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It was her favour, and she gave it me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bear her this from me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with this ring bid her receive my heart—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart! alas, my heart I cannot give;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How should I give her that which is her own?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And your heart be hers, her heart is yours, and so change is no robbery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, I'll give her your tokens, and tell her what ye say.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.
Do, good nurse; but in any case let not my father know that I am here,
until we have effected all our purposes.</p>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll warrant you, I will not play with you, as Master Churms does with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sophos; I would ha' my ears cut from my head first.</p>

<empty-line/>

Come, Sophos, cheer up yourself, man;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let hope expel these melancholy dumps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Meanwhile, let's in, expecting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How the events of this device will fall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until to-morrow at th'appointed time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When we'll expect the coming of your love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, man, I'll work it through the fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But you shall have her.</p>

And I will study to deserve this love.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Look on me, and look of Master Churms, a good, proper man. Marry, Master</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Churms has something a better pair of legs indeed, but for a sweet face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

a fine beard, comely corpse, and a carousing codpiece.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    All England, if it can,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Show me such a man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To win a wench, by Gis,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To clip, to coll, to kiss,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As William Cricket is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Why, look you now: if I had been such a great, long, large, lobcocked,
loselled lurden, as Master Churms is, I'll warrant you, I should never
have got Peg as long as I had lived, for, do you mark, a wench will
never love a man that has all his substance in his legs. But stay: here
comes my landlord; I must go salute him.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter old</emphasis> PLOD-ALL <emphasis>and his son</emphasis> PETER.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.
Come hither, Peter. When didst thou see Robin Goodfellow? He's the man
must do the fact.</p>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
Faith, father, I see him not this two days, but I'll seek him out, for
I know he'll do the deed, and she were twenty Leilas. For, father, he's
a very cunning man for give him but ten groats, and he'll give me a
powder that will make Lelia come to bed to me, and when I have her there,
I'll use her well enough.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will he so? Marry, I will give him vorty shillings, if he can do it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
Nay, he'll do more than that too, for he'll make himself like a devil,
and fray the scholar that hankers about her out on's wits.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.
Marry, Jesus bless us! will he so? Marry, thou shalt have vorty
shillings to give him, and thy mother shall bestow a hard cheese
on him beside.</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Landlord, a pox on you, this good morn!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How now, fool? what, dost curse me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
How now, fool! How now, caterpillar? It's a sign of death, when such
vermin creep hedges so early in the morning.</p>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sirrah foul manners, do you know to whom you speak?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Indeed, Peter, I must confess I want some of your wooing manners, or
else I might have turned my fair bushtail to you instead of your father,
and have given you the ill salutation this morning.</p>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
Let him alone, Peter; I'll temper him well enough. Sirrah, I hear say,
you must be married shortly. I'll make you pay a sweet fine for your
house for this. Ha, sirrah! am not I your landlord?</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Yes, for fault of a better; but you get neither sweet fine nor sour
fine of me.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My masters, I pray you bear witness I do discharge him then.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
My masters, I pray you bear witness my landlord has given me a general
discharge. I'll be married presently. My fine's paid; I have a discharge
for it.    [<emphasis>He offers to go away</emphasis>.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, prythee, stay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
No, I'll not stay. I'll go call the clerk. I'll be cried out upon i' the
church presently. What, ho! what, clerk, I say? where are you?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CLERK.</p>
<p>CLERK.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who calls me? what would you with me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Marry, sir, I would have you to make proclamation that, if any manner of
man, o' the town or the country, can lay any claim to Peg Pudding, let
him bring word to the crier, or else William Cricket will wipe his nose
of her.</p>
<p>CLERK.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You mean, you would be asked i' the church?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Ay, that's it. A bots on't, I cannot hit of these marrying terms yet.
And I'll desire my landlord here and his son to be at the celebration of
my marriage too. I' faith, Peter, you shall cram your guts full of
cheesecakes and custards there; and, sirrah clerk, if thou wilt say amen
stoutly, i' faith, my powder-beef-slave, I'll have a rump of beef for
thee, shall make thy mouth stand o' the tother side.</p>
<p>CLERK.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When would you have it done?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Marry, e'en as soon as may be. Let me see; I will be asked i' the church
of Sunday morning prayer, and again at evening prayer, and the next
holyday that comes, I will be asked i' the forenoon and married i' the
afternoon, for, do you mark, I am none of these sneaking fellows that
will stand thrumming of caps and studying upon a matter, as long as
Hunks with the great head has been about to show his little wit in the
second part of his paltry poetry,[156] but if I begin with wooing, I'll
end with wedding, and therefore, good clerk, let me have it done with
all speed; for, I promise you, I am very sharp-set.</p>
<p>CLERK.
Faith, you may be asked i' the church on Sunday at morning prayer, but
Sir John cannot 'tend[157] to do it at evening prayer, for there comes a
company of players to the town on Sunday i' the afternoon, and Sir John
is so good a fellow that I know he'll scarce leave their company to say
evening prayer; for, though I say it, he's a very painful man, and takes
so great delight in that faculty, that he'll take as great pain about
building of a stage or so, as the basest fellow among them.</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Nay, if he have so lawful an excuse, I am content to defer it one day
the longer; and, landlord, I hope you and your son Peter will make bold
with us, and trouble us.</p>
<p>PLOD-ALL.
Nay, William, we would be loth to trouble you; but you shall have our
company there.</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Faith, you shall be very heartily welcome, and we will have good merry
rogues there, that will make you laugh till you burst.</p>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, William, what company do you mean to have?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Marry, first and foremost, there will be an honest Dutch cobbler, that
will sing <emphasis>I will noe meare to Burgaine[158] go</emphasis>, the best that ever you
heard.</p>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, must a cobbler be your chief guest? Why, he's a base fellow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
A base fellow! You may be ashamed to say so, for he's an honest fellow
and a good fellow; and he begins to carry the very badge of
good-fellowship upon his nose, that I do not doubt but in time he will
prove as good a cup-companion as Robin Goodfellow himself. Ay, and he's
a tall fellow, and a man of his hands too, for, I'll tell you what—tie
him to the bull-ring, and for a bag-pudding, a custard, a cheesecake, a
hog's cheek, or a calf's head, turn any man i' the town to him, and if
he do not prove himself as tall a man as he, let blind Hugh bewitch him,
and turn his body into a barrel of strong ale, and let his nose be the
spigot, his mouth the faucet, and his tongue a plug for the bunghole.
And then there will be Robin Goodfellow, as good a drunken rogue as
lives, and Tom Shoemaker; and I hope you will not deny that he's an
honest man, for he was constable o' the town; and a number of other
honest rascals which, though they are grown bankrouts, and live at the
reversion of other men's tables, yet, thanks be to God, they have a
penny amongst them at all times at their need.</p>
<p>PETER PLOD-ALL.
Nay, if Robin Goodfellow be there, you shall be sure to have our
company; for he's one that we hear very well of, and my son here has
some occasion to use him, and therefore, if we may know when 'tis,
we'll make bold to trouble you.</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, I'll send you word.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PLOD-ALL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why then farewell, till we hear from you.</p>
<empty-line/>

Well, clerk, you'll see this matter bravely performed; let it be
done as it should be.</p>
<p>CLERK.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll warrant ye; fear it not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Why, then, go you to Sir John, and I'll to my wench, and bid her give
her maidenhead warning to prepare itself; for the destruction of it is
at hand.

How love and fortune both with eager mood,</p>

<p>

Like greedy hounds, do hunt my tired heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rous'd forth the thickets of my wonted joys!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Cupid winds his shrill-note buglehorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For joy my silly heart so near is spent:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Desire, that eager cur, pursues the chase,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fortune rides amain unto the fall;</p>

Now sorrow sings, and mourning bears a part,</p>

<p>Nurse, what news?</p>
<p>NURSE.
Faith, a whole sackful of news. You love Sophos, and Sophos loves you,
and Peter Plod-all loves you, and you love not him, and you love not
Master Churms, and he loves you; and so, here's love and no love, and I
love and I love not, and I cannot tell what; but of all and of all
Master Churms must be the man you must love.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, first I'll mount me on the winged wind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fly for succour to the furthest Ind.</p>
<empty-line/>

Must I love Master Churms?</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith, you must, and you must not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As how, I pray thee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, I have commendations to you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>

From whom?</p>

<empty-line/>

From your brother Fortunatus.</p>

My brother Fortunatus!</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

No, from Sophos.</p>

<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From my love?</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prythee, leave thy foolery, and let me know thy news.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
Your brother Fortunatus and your love to-morrow night will meet you by
the forest-side, there to confer about I know not what: but it is like
that Sophos will make you of his privy council, before you come again.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is Fortunatus then returned from the wars?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
He is with Sophos every day: but in any case you must not let your
father know; for he hath sworn he will not be descried, until he have
effected your desires; for he swaggers and swears out of all cry, that
he will venture all,</p>
<p>    Both fame and blood, and limb and life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But Lelia shall be Sophos' wedded wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! nurse, my father's jealous brain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth scarce allow me once a month to go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beyond the compass of his watchful eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor once afford me any conference</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With any man, except with Master Churms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose crafty brain beguiles my father so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That he reposeth trust in none but him:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And though he seeks for favour at my hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He takes his mark amiss, and shoots awry;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I had rather see the devil himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than Churms the lawyer. Therefore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How I should meet them by the forest-side</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot possibly devise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
And Master Churms must be the man must work the means: you must this
night send for him; make him believe you love him mightily; tell him you
have a secret friend dwells far away beyond the forest, to whom, if he
can secretly convey you from your father, tell him, you will love him
better than ever God loved him: and when you come to the place
appointed, let them alone to discharge the knave of clubs: and that you
must not fail, here receive this ring, which Fortunatus sent you for a
token, that this is the plot that you must prosecute; and this from
Sophos, as his true love's pledge.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This ring my brother sent, I know right well:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But this my true love's pledge I more esteem</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than all the golden mines the solid earth contains—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see, in happy time, here comes Master Churms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CHURMS.</p>
<p>Now love and fortune both conspire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sort their drifts to compass my desire.</p>

Master Churms, y'are well met; I am glad to see you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I as glad to see fair Lelia,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As ever Paris was to see his dear;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For whom so many Trojans' blood was spilt:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor think I would do less than spend my dearest blood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To gain fair Lelia's love, although by loss of life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>NURSE.
'Faith, mistress, he speaks like a gentleman. Let me persuade you; be
not hard-hearted. Sophos? Why, what's he? If he had loved you but half
so well, he would ha' come through stone walls, but he would have come
to you ere this.</p>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I must confess, I once lov'd Sophos well;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now I cannot love him, whom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All the world knows to be a dissembler.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ere I would wrong my love with one day's absence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would pass the boiling Hellespont,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As once Leander did for Hero's love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or undertake a greater task than that,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ere I would be disloyal to my love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if that Lelia give her free consent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That both our loves may sympathise in one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My hand, my heart, my love, my life, and all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall ever tend on Lelia's fair command.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Master Churms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Methinks 'tis strange you should make such a motion:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Say, I should yield and grant you love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When most you did expect a sunshine day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father's will would mar your hop'd-for hay;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when you thought to reap the fruits of love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His hard constraint would blast it in the bloom:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For he so doats on Peter Plod-all's pelf,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That none but he forsooth must be the man:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will rather match myself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto a groom of Pluto's grisly den,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than unto such a silly golden ass.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bravely resolved, i' faith!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, to be short—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have a secret friend, that dwells from hence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some two days' journey, that's the most;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if you can, as well I know you may,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Convey me thither secretly—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For company I desire no other than your own—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here take my hand:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That once perform'd, my heart is next.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If on th'adventure all the dangers lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That Europe or the western world affords;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were it to combat Cerberus himself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or scale the brazen walls of Pluto's court,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When as there is so fair a prize propos'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I shrink back, or leave it unperform'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let the world canonise me for a coward:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Appoint the time, and leave the rest to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When night's black mantle overspreads the sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And day's bright lamp is drenched in the west—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To-morrow night I think the fittest time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That silent shade[s] may give us[159] safe convoy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto our wished hopes, unseen of living eye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>

And at that time I will not fail</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In that, or ought may make for our avail.</p>

<p>NURSE.
But what if Sophos should meet you by the forest-side, and encounter
you with his single rapier?</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sophos? a hop of my thumb!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wretch, a wretch! Should Sophos meet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Us there accompani'd with some champion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With whom 'twere any credit to encounter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were he as stout as Hercules himself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then would I buckle with them hand to hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bandy blows, as thick as hailstones fall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And carry Lelia away in spite of all their force.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What? love will make cowards fight—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Much more a man of my resolution.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on your resolution I'll depend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until to-morrow at th'appointed time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I look for you: till when I leave you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And go make preparation for our journey.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.
Farewell, fair love, until we meet again. Why so: did I not tell you she
would be glad to run away with me at length? Why, this falls out, e'en
as a man would say, thus I would have it. But now I must go cast about
for some money too. Let me see, I have outlawed three or four of Gripe's
debtors; and I have the bonds in mine own hands. The sum that is due to
him is some two or three hundred pounds. Well, I'll to them; if I can
get but one half, I'll deliver them their bonds, and leave the other
half to their own consciences: and so I shall be sure to get money to
bear charges. When all fails, well fare a good wit! But soft; no more of
that. Here comes Master Gripe.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> GRIPE.</p>
<p>GRIPE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, Master Churms? what, all alone? How fares your body?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.
Faith, sir, reasonable well: I am e'en walking here to take the
fresh air.</p>
<p>GRIPE.
'Tis very wholesome, this fair weather. But, Master Churms, how like you
my daughter? Can you do any good on her? Will she be ruled yet? How
stands she affected to Peter Plod-all?</p>
<p>CHURMS.
O, very well, sir; I have made her very conformable. O, let me alone to
persuade a woman. I hope you shall see her married within this week at
most,—(<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>) I mean to myself.</p>
<p>GRIPE.
Master Churms, I am so exceedingly beholding to you, I cannot tell how I
shall requite your kindness. But, i' the meantime, here's a brace of
angels for you to drink for your pains. This news hath e'en lightened my
heart. O sir, my neighbour Plod-all is very wealthy. Come, Master
Churms, you shall go home with me: we'll have good cheer, and be merry
for this to-night, i' faith.</p>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, let them laugh that win.    [<emphasis>Aside. Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> PEG <emphasis>and her</emphasis> GRANAM.</p>
<p>PEG.
Granam, give me but two crowns of red gold, and I'll give you twopence
of white silver, if Robin the devil be not a water-witch.</p>
<p>MOTHER MIDNIGHT.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, Jesus bless us! why, prythee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PEG.
Marry, I'll tell you why. Upon the morrow after the blessed new year, I
came trip, trip, trip, over the market hill, holding up my petticoat to
the calves of my legs, to show my fine coloured stockings, and how
finely I could foot it in a pair of new corked shoes I had bought; and
there I spied this Monsieur Muffe lie gaping up into the skies, to know
how many maids would be with child in the town all the year after. O,
'tis a base vexation slave! How the country talks of the large-ribbed
varlet!</p>
<p>MOTHER MIDNIGHT.
Marry, out upon him. What a Friday-faced slave it is: I think in my
conscience, his face never keeps holiday.</p>
<p>PEG.
Why, his face can never be at quiet. He has such a choleric nose, I
durst ha' sworn by my maidenhead (God forgive me, that I should take
such an oath), that if William had had such a nose, I would never ha'
loved him.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> WILLIAM CRICKET.</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
What a talking is here of noses? Come, Peg, we are toward marriage; let
us talk of that may do us good. Granam, what will you give us toward
housekeeping?</p>
<p>MOTHER MIDNIGHT.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, William, we are talking of Robin Goodfellow. What think you of him?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Marry, I say, he looks like a tankard-bearer that dwells in Petticoat
Lane at the sign of the Mermaid; and I swear by the blood of my
codpiece, and I were a woman, I would lug off his lave[160] ears, or
run him to death with a spit. And, for his face, I think 'tis pity there
is not a law made, that it should be felony to name it in any other
places than in bawdy-houses. But, Granam, what will you give us?</p>
<p>MOTHER MIDNIGHT.
Marry, I will give Peg a pot and a pan, two platters, a dish and a
spoon, a dog and a cat. I trow, she'll prove a good huswife, and love
her husband well too.</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
If she love me, I'll love her. I' faith, my sweet honeycomb, I'll love
thee <emphasis>A per se A</emphasis>. We must be asked in church next Sunday; and we'll be
married presently.</p>
<p>PEG.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I' faith, William, we'll have a merry day on't.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MOTHER MIDNIGHT.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That we will, i' faith, Peg; we'll have a whole noise of fiddlers there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Peg, let's hie us home; we'll make a bag-pudding to supper, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

William shall go and sup with us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Come on, i' faith.
                      [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>

<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, how now, Sophos? all <emphasis>amort</emphasis>? still languishing in love?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will not the presence of thy friend prevail,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor hope expel these sullen fits?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cannot mirth wring if but a forged smile</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From those sad drooping looks of thine?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rely on hope, whose hap will lead thee right</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To her, whom thou dost call thy heart's delight:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Look cheerly, man; the time is near at hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That Hymen, mounted on a snow-white coach,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall tend on Sophos and his lovely bride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis impossible: her father, man, her father—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He's all for Peter Plod-all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should I but see that Plod-all offer love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This sword should pierce the peasant's breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And chase his soul from his accursed corpse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By an unwonted way unto the grisly lake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now th'appointed time is near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That Churms should come with his supposed love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then sit we down under these leafy shades,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wait the time of Lelia's wish'd approach.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                               [<emphasis>They sit down</emphasis>.</p>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ay, here I'll wait for Lelia's wish'd approach;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More wish'd to me than is a calm at sea[161]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To shipwreck'd souls, when great god Neptune frowns.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though sad despair hath almost drown'd my hopes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet would I pass the burning vaults of Ork[162],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As erst did Hercules to fetch his love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I might meet my love upon the strond,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And but enjoy her love one minute of an hour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<p>But stay; what man or devil, or hellish fiend comes here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Transformed in this ugly, uncouth shape?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, peace a while; you shall see good sport anon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now I am clothed in this hellish shape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I could meet with Sophos in these woods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, he would take me for the devil himself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I should ha' good laughing, beside the forty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shillings Peter Plod-all has given me; and if</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I get no more, I'm sure of that. But soft;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now I must try my cunning, for here he sits.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The high commander of the damned souls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great Dis, the duke of devils, and prince of Limbo lake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

High regent of Acheron, Styx, and Phlegeton,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By strict command from Pluto, hell's great monarch,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fair Proserpina, the queen of hell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By full consent of all the damned hags,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all the fiends that keep the Stygian plains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath sent me here from depth of underground</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To summon thee to appear at Pluto's court.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A man or devil, or whatsoe'er thou art,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll try if blows will drive thee down to hell:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Belike, thou art the devil's parator,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The basest officer that lives in hell;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For such thy words import thee for to be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis pity you should come so far without a fee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And because I know money goes low with Sophos,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll pay you your fees:    [<emphasis>He beats him</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Take that and that, and that, upon thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O good sir, I beseech you; I'll do anything.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then down to hell; for sure thou art a devil.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, hold your hands; I am not a devil, by my troth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.
Zounds, dost thou cross me? I say thou art a devil.
                                [<emphasis>Beats him again</emphasis>.</p>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Lord! sir, save my life, and I'll say as you say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or anything else you'll ha' me do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then stand up,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make a preachment of thy pedigree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And how at first thou learn'dst this devilish trade:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Up, I say.    [<emphasis>Beats him</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, I will, sir: although in some places    [<emphasis>Stands upon a stool</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I bear the title of a scurvy gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By birth I am a boat-wright's son of Hull,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father got me of a refus'd hag,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Under the old ruins of Booby's barn;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who, as she liv'd, at length she likewise died,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for her good deeds went unto the devil:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, hell not wont to harbour such a guest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her fellow-fiends do daily make complaint</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto grim Pluto and his lady queen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of her unruly misbehaviour;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Entreating that a passport might be drawn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For her to wander till the day of doom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On earth again, to vex the minds of men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And swore she was the fittest fiend in hell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To drive men to desperation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To this intent her passport straight was drawn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in a whirlwind forth of hell she came:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er hills she hurls, and scours along the plains;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The trees flew up by th'roots, the earth did quake for fear;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The houses tumble down; she plays the devil and all:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At length, not finding any one so fit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To effect her devilish charge as I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She comes to me, as to her only child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And me her instrument on earth she made:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And by her means I learn'd that devilish trade.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O monstrous villain!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But tell me, what's thy course of life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And how thou shift'st for maintenance in the world?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith, sir, I am in a manner a promoter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or (more fitly term'd) a promoting knave;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I creep into the presence of great men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, under colour of their friendships,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Effect such wonders in the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That babes will curse me that are yet unborn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the best men I raise a common fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And honest women rob of their good name:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus daily tumbling in comes all my thrift;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I get best, is got but by a shift:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But the chief course of all my life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is to set discord betwixt man and wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Out upon thee, cannibal!    [<emphasis>He beats him</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dost thou think thou shalt ever come to heaven?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I little hope for heav'n or heavenly bliss:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But if in hell doth any place remain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of more esteem than is another room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hope, as guerdon for my just desert,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To have it for my detestable acts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were't not thy tongue condemns thy guilty soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I could not think that on this living earth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Did breathe a villain more audacious.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go, get thee gone, and come not in my walk;    [<emphasis>Beats him</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For, if thou dost, thou com'st unto thy woe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ROBIN GOODFELLOW.
The devil himself was never conjur'd so.

<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>

Sure, he's no man, but an incarnate devil,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose ugly shape bewrays his monstrous mind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if he be a devil, I am sure he's gone:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Churms the lawyer will be here anon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with him comes my sister Lelia;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis he I am sure you look for.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, she it is that I expect so long.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then sit we down, until we hear more news,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This but a prologue to our play ensues.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                         [<emphasis>They sit down</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CHURMS <emphasis>and</emphasis> LELIA.</p>
<p>But see where Churms and Lelia comes along:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He walks as stately as the great baboon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Zounds, he looks as though his mother were a midwife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, gentle Jove, great monarch of the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grant good success unto my wand'ring hopes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now Phoebus' silver eye is drench'd in western deep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Luna 'gins to show her splendent rays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all the harmless quiristers of woods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do take repose, save only Philomel;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose heavy tunes do evermore record</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With mournful lays the losses of her love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus far, fair love, we pass in secret sort</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beyond the compass of thy father's bounds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whilst he on down-soft bed securely sleeps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And not so much as dreams of our depart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The dangers pass'd, now think on nought but love;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll be thy dear, be thou my heart's delight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, first I'll send thy soul to coal-black night.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou promis'dst love, now seal it with a kiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, soft, sir; your mark is at the fairest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forswear her love, and seal it with a kiss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the burnish'd splendour of this blade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or it shall rip the entrails of thy peasant heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, let me do it, that's my part.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You wrong me much, to rob me of my love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Avaunt, base braggard! Lelia's mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She lately promis'd love to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Peace, night-raven, peace! I'll end this controversy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Lelia, stand between them both,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As equal judge to end this strife:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Say which of these shall have thee to his wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I can devise no better way than this.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now choose thy love, and greet him with a kiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.
My choice is made, and here it is.
                          [<emphasis>She kisses Sophos</emphasis>.</p>
<p>SOPHOS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See here the mirror of true constancy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose steadfast love deserves a prince's worth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Master Churms, are you not well?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I must confess I would have chosen you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But that I ne'er beheld your legs till now;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Trust me, I never look'd so low before.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I know, you use to look aloft.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet not so high as your crown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, if you had?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LELIA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith, I should ha' spied but a calf's head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Zounds, cosen'd of the wench, and scoff'd at too!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis intolerable; and shall I lose her thus?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How it mads me, that I brought not my sword</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And buckler with me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, are you in your sword-and-buckler terms?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll put you out of that humour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There, Lelia sends you that by me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that, to recompense your love's desires;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that, as payment for your well-earn'd hire.    [<emphasis>Beats him</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go, get thee gone, and boast of Lelia's love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CHURMS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where'er I go, I'll leave with her my curse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And rail on you with speeches vild.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A crafty knave was never so beguil'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now Sophos' hopes have had their lucky haps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he enjoys the presence of his love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My vow's perform'd, and I am full reveng'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon this hell-bred race of cursed imps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now rests nought but my father's free consent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To knit the knot that time can ne'er untwist,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that, as this, I likewise will perform.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No sooner shall Aurora's pearled dew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'erspread the mantled earth with silver drops,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Phoebus bless the orient with a blush,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To chase black night to her deformed cell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I'll repair unto my father's house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And never cease with my enticing words,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To work his will to knit this Gordian knot:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till when I'll leave you to your am'rous chat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dear friend, adieu; fair sister, too, farewell:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betake yourselves unto some secret place,</p>

Master Gripe, I was coming to desire that I might have your absence at
my wedding; for I hear say you are very liberal grown o' late. For I
spake with three or four of your debtors this morning, that ought you
hundred pounds a piece; and they told me that you sent Master Churms to
them, and took of some ten pounds, and of some twenty, and delivered
them their bonds, and bad them pay the rest when they were able.</p>
<p>GRIPE.
I am undone, I am robbed! My daughter! my money! Which way are they
gone?</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Faith, sir, it's all to nothing, but your daughter and Master Churms are
gone both one way. Marry, your money flies, some one way, and some
another; and therefore 'tis but a folly to make hue and cry after it.</p>
<p>GRIPE.
Follow them, make hue and cry after them. My daughter! my money! all's
gone! what shall I do?</p>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Faith, if you will be ruled by me, I'll tell you what you shall do. Mark
what I say; for I'll teach you the way to come to heaven, if you stumble
not—give all you have to the poor but one single penny, and with that
penny buy you a good strong halter; and when you ha' done so, come to
me, and I'll tell you what you shall do with it.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>

What moves my father to these uncouth fits?</p>

Faith, sir, he's almost mad; I think he cannot tell you: and therefore
I—presuming, sir, that my wit is something better than his at this
time—do you mark, sir?—out of the profound circumambulation of my
supernatural wit, sir—do you understand?—will tell you the whole
superfluity of the matter, sir. Your sister Lelia, sir, you know, is a
woman, as another woman is, sir.</p>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, and what of that?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Nay, nothing, sir; but she fell in love with one Sophos, a very proper,
wise young man, sir. Now, sir, your father would not let her have him,
sir; but would have married her to one, sir, that would have fed her
with nothing but barley bag-puddings and fat bacon. Now, sir, to tell
you the truth, the fool, ye know, has fortune to land; but Mistress
Lelia's mouth doth not hang for that kind of diet.</p>
<p>FORTUNATUS.</p>

<p>

And how then?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
Marry then, there was a certain cracking, cogging, pettifogging,
butter-milk slave, sir, one Churms, sir, that is the very quintessence
of all the knaves in the bunch: and if the best man of all his kin had
been but so good as a yeoman's son, he should have been a marked knave
by letters patents. And he, sir, comes me sneaking, and cosens them both
of their wench, and is run away with her. And, sir, belike, he has
cosened your father here of a great deal of his money too.</p>

Sir, your father did trust him but too much; but I always thought he
would prove a crafty knave.</p>

Both joys and hopes hang of a silly twine,</p>

daughter.</p>

I curse the time I cross'd her in her choice;</p>

Her choice was virtuous, but my will was base:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I sought to grace her from the Indian mines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But she sought honour from the starry mount.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What frantic fit possess'd my foolish brain?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What furious fancy fired so my heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hate fair virtue, and to scorn desert?</p>
<empty-line/>

And he usurps fair Lelia's nuptial bed.</p>

But if you give your full consent,</p>

That Sophos may enjoy his long-wish'd love,</p>
<empty-line/>

And have fair Lelia to his lovely bride,</p>

I'll follow Churms whate'er betide;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll be as swift as is the light-foot roe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And overtake him ere his journey's end,</p>

And bring fair Lelia back unto my friend.</p>

Ay, here's my hand; I do consent,</p>

And think her happy in her happy choice;</p>

Yet half forejudge my hopes will be deceiv'd.</p>

But, Fortunatus, I must needs commend</p>

Thy constant mind thou bear'st unto thy friend:</p>

Of planets' course, or secret magic spells,</p>

And he sued you upon wilful murder?</p>

No; but he went to law with me, and would make me either pay for his
sow, or hang my dog. Now, sir, to the same returna[164] I went.</p>
<p>NURSE.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To beg a pardon for your dog?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILL CRICKET.
No; but to have some of his wit for my money. I gave him his fee, and
promised him a goose beside for his counsel. Now, sir, his counsel was
to deny all was asked me, and to crave a longer time to answer, though I
knew the case was plain. So, sir, I take his counsel; and always when he
sends to me for his goose, I deny it, and crave a longer time to answer.</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Of the author of "Lingua" nothing is known. By some of our earlier
bibliographers the play was ascribed, without the slightest authority,
to Anthony Brewer.</p>
<p>In the former edition it was pointed out that Winstanley gave to the
same writer (among other pieces which he probably did <emphasis>not</emphasis> write)
"Pathomachia; or, Love's Loadstone," published in 1630, upon which
point Reed observes:—"Whoever was the real author of 'Lingua,' there
is some plausibility in assigning to him also 'Pathomachia; or, Love's
Lodestone,' for they are certainly written upon the same plan, and very
much in the same stile, although the former is considerably superior
to the latter, both in design and execution. The first scene of
'Pathomachia' contains an allusion by Pride, one of the characters, to
'Lingua,' where it is said, 'Methinks it were fit now to renew the claim
to our old title of Affections, which we have lost, as sometimes Madame
Lingua did to the title of a Sense, for it is good fishing in troubled
waters.'</p>
<p>"'Pathomachia' was not printed until 1630, and most likely was not
written until some years after 'Lingua,' from the allusion it contains
in act ii. to the stile of the stage, and the mention in act i. of
Coriat, the traveller, who did not become notorious until after the
publication of his 'Crudities' in 1611….</p>
<p>"The first edition of 'Lingua' is dated 1607, but from a passage in act
iv. sc. 7, it is evident that it was produced before the death of
Elizabeth. The last edition, in 1657, is rendered curious by the
circumstance that the bookseller, Simon Miller, asserts that it was
acted by Oliver Cromwell, the late usurper. This fact is not stated on
the title-page to the play, but in a list of works printed for the same
stationer, placed at the end of Heath's 'New Book of Loyal Martyrs'
[12mo, 1663][166]…. Winstanley adds that the late usurper Cromwell
[when a young man] had therein the part of <emphasis>Tactus</emphasis>; and this mock
ambition for the Crown is said to have swollen his ambition so high,
that afterwards he contended for it in earnest…."</p>
<p>The present text is taken from the 4to of 1607.]</p>

<p>ACTUS PRIMUS, SCAENA PRIMA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LINGUA <emphasis>apparelled in a crimson satin gown, a dressing of
    white roses, a little skene[168] tied in a purple scarf,
    a pair of white buskins[169] drawn with white ribbon, silk
    garters, gloves, &amp;c</emphasis>. AUDITUS <emphasis>in a garland of bays
    intermingled with red and white roses upon a false hair,
    a cloth of silver mantle upon a pair of satin bases, wrought

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    LINGUA, AUDITUS.</strong></p>
<p>LIN. Nay, good Auditus, do but hear me speak.</p>
<p>AUD. Lingua, thou strik'st too much upon one string,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy tedious plain-song[170] grates my tender ears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. 'Tis plain indeed, for truth no descant needs;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Una's her name, she cannot be divided.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AUD. O, but the ground[171] itself is naught, from whence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou canst not relish out a good division:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Therefore at length surcease, prove not stark-mad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hopeless to prosecute a hapless suit:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For though (perchance) thy first strains pleasing are,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I dare engage mine ear the close[172] will jar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. If then your confidence esteem my cause</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be so frivolous and weakly wrought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why do you daily subtle plots devise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To stop me from the ears of common sense?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom since our great queen Psyche hath ordain'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For his sound wisdom, our vice-governor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him and to his two so wise assistants,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nimble Phantastes and firm Memory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Myself and cause I humbly do commit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let them but hear and judge; I wish no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AUD. Should they but know thy rash presumption,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They would correct it in the sharpest sort:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good Jove! what sense hast thou to be a sense!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since from the first foundation of the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We never were accounted more than five.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet you, forsooth, an idle prating dame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would fain increase the number, and upstart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To our high seats, decking your babbling self</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With usurp'd titles of our dignity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. An idle prating dame! know, fond Auditus,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Records affirm my title full as good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As his amongst the five is counted best.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AUD. Lingua, confess the truth: thou'rt wont to lie.</p>
<p>LIN. I say so too, therefore I do not lie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now, spite of you all, I speak the truth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You five among us subjects tyrannise;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Making the sacred name of Common Sense</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A cloak to cover your enormities:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He bears the rule; he's judge, but judgeth still,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As he's inform'd by your false evidence:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So that a plaintiff cannot have access,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But through your gates. He hears, but what? nought else,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But what thy crafty ears to him conveys:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all he sees is by proud Visus show'd him:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And what he touches is by Tactus' hand;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And smells, I know, but through Olfactus' nose;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gustus begins to him whate'er he tastes:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By these quaint tricks free passage hath been barr'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I could never equally be heard.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But well, 'tis well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AUD.                 Lingua, thy feeble sex</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath hitherto withheld my ready hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That long'd to pluck that nimble instrument.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. O horrible ingratitude! that thou—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That thou of all the rest should'st threaten me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who by my means conceiv'st as many tongues,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As Neptune closeth lands betwixt his arms:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ancient Hebrew clad with mysteries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The learned Greek rich in fit epithets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bless'd in the lovely marriage of pure words:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Chaldee wise, th'Arabian physical,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Roman eloquent and Tuscan grave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The braving Spanish and the smooth-tongu'd French:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These precious jewels that adorn thine ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All from my mouth's rich cabinet are stolen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How oft hast thou been chain'd unto my tongue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hang'd at my lips, and ravish'd with my words;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So that a speech fair-feather'd could not fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But thy ear's pitfall caught it instantly?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now, O heavens!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AUD. O heavens! thou wrong'st me much,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou wrong'st me much thus falsely to upbraid me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had not I granted thee the use of hearing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That sharp-edged tongue whetted against her master,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those puffing lungs, those teeth, those drowsy lips,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That scalding throat, those nostrils full of ire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy palate, proper instrument of speech,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like to the winged chanters of the wood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Uttering nought else but idle sifflements,[173]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tunes without sense, words inarticulate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had ne'er been able t' have abus'd me thus.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Words are thy children, but of my begetting.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. Perfidious liar, how can I endure thee!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Call'st my unspotted chastity in question?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, could I use the breath mine anger spends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'd make thee know—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>AUD.                Heav'ns look on my distress,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Defend me from this railing viperess!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For if I stay, her words' sharp vinegar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will fret me through. Lingua, I must be gone:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hear one call me more than earnestly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> AUDITUS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. May the loud cannoning of thunderbolts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Screeking of wolves, howling of tortur'd ghosts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pursue thee still, and fill thy amaz'd ears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With cold astonishment and horrid fears!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, how these senses muffle Common Sense!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And more and more with pleasing objects strive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To dull his judgment and pervert his will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To their behests: who, were he not so wrapp'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'the dusky clouds of their dark policies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would never suffer right to suffer wrong.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fie, Lingua, wilt thou now degenerate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Art not a woman? dost not love revenge?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Delightful speeches, sweet persuasions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have this long time us'd to get my right.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My right—that is, to make the senses six;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And have both name and power with the rest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oft have I season'd savoury periods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With sugar'd words, to delude Gustus' taste,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And oft embellish'd my entreative phrase</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With smelling flow'rs of vernant rhetoric,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Limning and flashing it with various dyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To draw proud Visus to me by the eyes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And oft perfum'd my petitory[174] style</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With civet-speech, t'entrap Olfactus' nose;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And clad myself in silken eloquence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To allure the nicer touch of Tactus' hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But all's become lost labour, and my cause</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is still procrastinated: therefore now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hence, ye base offspring of a broken mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Supple entreaties and smooth flatteries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go kiss the love-sick lips of puling gulls,[175]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That 'still their brain to quench their love's disdain:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go gild the tongues of bawds and parasites;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come not within my thoughts. But thou, deceit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Break up the pleasure of my brimful breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enrich my mind with subtle policies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well then, I'll go; whither? nay, what know I?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And do, in faith I will, the devil knows what.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, if I set them all at variance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so obtain to speak? it must be so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It must be so, but how? there lies the point:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How? thus: tut, this device will never prove,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Augment it so: 'twill be too soon descried;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or so, nor so; 'tis too-too dangerous.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pish, none of these! what, if I take this course? ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, there it goes; good, good; most excellent!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that will catch eels must disturb the flood;</p>

<p>LIN. Whilome this crown and gorgeous ornament</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were the great prize for which five orators</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With the sharp weapons of their tongues contended:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But all their speeches were so equal wrought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And alike gracious,[178] that, if his were witty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His was as wise; the third's fair eloquence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Did parallel the fourth's firm gravity;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The last's good gesture kept the balance even</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all the rest; so that the sharpest eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And most judicious censor could not judge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To whom the hanging victory should fall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Therefore with one consent they all agreed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To offer up both crown and robe to me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the chief patroness of their profession,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which heretofore I holily have kept,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like to a miser's gold, to look on only.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now I'll put them to a better use,</p>
<empty-line/>

And venture both, in hope to—</p>

<p>LIN. They say a golden Ball</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bred enmity betwixt three goddesses;</p>

So shall this crown be author of debate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betwixt five senses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MEN. Where shall it be laid!</p>
<p>LIN. There, there, there; 'tis well; so, so, so.</p>
<p>MEN. A crown's a pleasing bait to look upon;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The craftiest fox will hardly 'scape this trap.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. Come, let us away, and leave it to the chance.</p>
<p>MEN. Nay, rather let me stand close hereabouts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see the event.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LIN. Do so, and if they doubt,</p>

How it came there, feign them some pretty fable,</p>

How now? what makes you sit so nicely?</p>

Tactus! Tactus!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>TAC. For this is true, man's life is wondrous brittle.</p>

<p>TAC. And many have been metamorphosed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To stranger matters and more uncouth forms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. I must go nearer him; he doth not hear.</p>
<p>TAC. And yet methinks, I speak as I was wont;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. Tactus, Tactus!</p>
<p>TAC. Olfactus, as thou lov'st me, come not near me.</p>
<p>OLF. Why, art thou hatching eggs? th'art afeard[185] to break them?</p>
<p>TAC. Touch me not, lest thou chance to break my life.</p>
<p>OLF. What's this under thee?</p>
<p>TAC. If thou meddle with me, I am utterly undone.</p>
<p>OLF. Why, man, what ails thee?</p>
<p>TAC. Let me alone, and I'll tell thee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lately I came from fine Phantastes' house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. So I believe, for thou art very foolish.</p>
<p>TAC. No sooner had I parted out of doors[186],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But up I held my hands before my face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To shield mine eyes from th'light's piercing beams;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I protest I saw the sun as clear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through these my palms, as through a perspective.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No marvel; for when I beheld my fingers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw my fingers were transform'd to glass;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Opening my breast, my breast was like a window,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through which I plainly did perceive my heart:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In whose two concaves[187] I discern'd my thoughts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Confus'dly lodged in great multitudes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. Ha, ha, ha, ha! why, this is excellent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Momus himself can find no fault with thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou'dst make a passing live anatomy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And decide the question much disputed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betwixt the Galenists and Aristotle.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>TAC. But when I had arriv'd, and set me down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Viewing myself—myself, ay me! was changed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As thou now seest, to a perfect urinal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. T'a perfect urinal? O monstrous, monstrous!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Art not mad to think so?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>TAC. I do not think so, but I say I am so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Therefore, Olfactus, come not near, I advise you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. See the strange working of dull melancholy!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose drossy thoughts, drying the feeble brain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Corrupts the sense, deludes the intellect,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in the soul's fair table falsely graves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whole squadrons of fantastical chimeras</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thousand vain imaginations,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Making some think their heads as big as horses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some that th'are dead[188], some that th'are turn'd to wolves[189],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As now it makes him think himself all glass.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tactus, dissuade thyself; thou dost but think so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>TAC. Olfactus, if thou lov'st me, get thee gone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am an urinal, I dare not stir</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For fear of cracking in the bottom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. Wilt thou sit thus all day?</p>
<p>TAC. Unless thou help me.</p>
<p>OLF. Bedlam must help thee. What wouldst have me do?</p>
<p>TAC. Go to the city, make a case for me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stuff it with wool, then come again and fetch me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OLF. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou'lt be laughed out of case and countenance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>TAC. I care not. So it must be, or I cannot stir.</p>
<p>OLF. I had best leave troubling him; he's obstinate. Urinal, I leave you,
but above all things take heed Jupiter sees you not; for, if he do, he'll
ne'er make water in a sieve again; thou'lt serve his turn so fit, to
carry his water unto Esculapius. Farewell, Urinal, farewell.

<p>TAC. Speak not so loud; the sound's enough to crack me. What, is he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

gone? I an urinal! ha, ha, ha! I protest I might have had my face washed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

finely if he had meant to abuse me. I an urinal! ha, ha, ha! Go to,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Urinal; you have 'scaped a fair scouring. Well, I'll away, and get me to</p>

Augmenting this one crown to troops of angels,</p>

<p>AUD. Tactus, Tactus!</p>
<p>TAC. O Jupiter, 'tis Auditus, all's marred, I doubt: the sly knave
hears so far; but yet I'll grope him. How now, Ears[195], what make
you here, ha?</p>
<p>AUD. Nay, what make you here, I pray? What were you talking even now
of an ass, and a crown, and an urinal, and a plague?</p>
<p>TAC. A plague on you! what, I?</p>
<p>AUD. O, what you!</p>
<p>TAC. O, I had well-nigh forgot; nothing; but I say—</p>
<p>AUD. What?</p>
<p>TAC. That if a man (do you mark, sir?), being sick of the plague (do you
see, sir?), had a, a, a—hem, hem (this cold troubles me; it makes me
cough sometimes extremely)—had a French crown, sir, (you understand
me?) lying by him, and (come hither, come hither), and would not bestow
twopence (do you hear?) to buy an urinal (do you mark me?) to carry his
water to the physician, hem!</p>
<p>AUD. What of all this?</p>
<p>TAC. I say such a one was a very ass. This was all. I use to speak to
myself, when I am alone; but, Auditus, when shall we hear a new set of
singing-books? Or the viols? Or the concert of instruments?</p>
<p>AUD. This was not all, for I heard mention of a tomb and an epitaph.</p>
<p>TAC. True, true, I made myself merry with this epitaph upon such a
fool's tomb thus a—thus, thus: plague brought this man—foh, I have
forgotten—O, thus, plague brought this man (so, so, so), unto his
burial, because, because, because (hem, hem)—because he would not buy
an urinal. Come, come, Auditus, shall we hear thee play the lyreway or
the luteway, shall we? Or the cornet, or any music? I am greatly
revived, when I hear.</p>

<p>

But this I'm sure, his hat had wings upon't.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>VIS. Doubtless 'twas he; but say, my boy, what did he?</p>
<p>MEN. First I beheld him hovering in the air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then down stooping with an hundred gyres:[196]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His feet he fixed on Mount Cephalon;[197]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From whence he flew and lighted on that plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with disdainful steps soon glided thither:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whither arrived, he suddenly unfolds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A gorgeous robe and glittering ornament,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lays them all upon that hillock:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This done, he wafts his wand, took wing again,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in a moment vanish'd out of sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With that mine eyes 'gan stare, and heart grew cold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all my quiv'ring joints with sweat bedew'd:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heels (methought) had wings as well as his,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so away I ran; but by the way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I met a man, as I thought, coming thither.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>GUS. Neither of yours, but mine as much as both.</p>
<p>AUD. And mine the most of any of you all.</p>
<p>VIS. Give me it, or else—</p>
<p>TAC. I'll make you late repent it—</p>
<p>GUS. Presumptuous as you are—</p>

<p>MEN. Never till now. Ha, ha! it works apace.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

But that your title, Tactus, is so good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gustus, I would swear the coronet were yours:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, will you all go brawl about a trifle?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

View but the pleasant coast of Microcosm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is't not great pity to be rent with wars?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is't not a shame to stain with brinish tears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The smiling cheeks of ever-cheerful peace?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is't not far better to live quietly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than broil in fury of dissension?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give me the crown, ye shall not disagree,</p>
<empty-line/>

    in a soldier's coat, a sword, &amp;c</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    MENDACIO, APPETITUS.</strong></p>
<p>MEN. I long to see those hotspur Senses at it: they say they have
gallant preparations, and not unlikely, for most of the soldiers are
ready in arms, since the last field fought against their yearly enemy
Meleager[201] and his wife Acrasia; that conquest hath so fleshed them,
that no peace can hold them. But had not Meleager been sick, and
Acrasia drunk, the Senses might have whistled for the victory.</p>
<p>APP. Foh, what a stink of gunpowder is yonder!</p>
<p>MEN. Who's this? O, O, 'tis Appetitus, Gustus's hungry parasite.
                                                       [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>APP. I cannot endure the smoking of guns, the thundering of drums: I
had rather hear the merry hacking of pot-herbs, and see the reeking of
a hot capon. If they would use no other bucklers in war but shields of
brawn, brandish no swords but sweards of bacon,[202] trail no spears
but spare-ribs of pork, and instead of arquebuss pieces discharge
artichoke-pies: toss no pikes but boiled pickrels, then Appetitus would
rouse up his crest, and bear up himself with the proudest.</p>
<p>MEN. Ah! here's a youth stark naught at a trench, but an old dog at a
trencher, a tall squire at a square table.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>APP. But now my good masters must pardon me; I am not one for their
service, for their service is without service, and indeed their service
is too hot for my diet. But what, if I be not myself, but only this be
my spirit that wanders up and down, and Appetitus be killed in the camp?
the devil he is as soon. How's that possible? tut, tut, I know I am. I
am Appetitus, and alive, too—by this infallible token, that I feel
myself hungry.</p>
<p>MEN. Thou mightest have taken a better token of thyself, by knowing thou
art a fool.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>APP. Well, then, though I made my fellow-soldiers admire the beauty of
my back, and wonder at the nimbleness of my heels, yet now will I, at
safety at home, tell in what dangers they are in abroad. I'll speak
nothing but guns and glaves,[203] and staves and phalanges,[204] and
squadrons and barricadoes, ambuscadoes, palmedoes, blank-point,
demi-point,[205] counterpoint, counterscarp, sallies and lies, saladoes,

<p>MEN. Why, who am I?</p>
<p>APP. Are you a soldier?</p>
<p>MEN. No.</p>
<p>APP. Then you are Master Helluo the bearward.</p>
<p>MEN. No, no; he's dead.</p>
<p>APP. Or Gulono the gutty serjeant, or Delphino the vintner, or else I
know you not; for these are all my acquaintance.</p>
<p>MEN. Would I were hanged, if I be any of these!</p>
<p>APP. What, Mendacio! By the faith of a knight, thou art welcome; I must
borrow thy whetstone, to sharpen the edges of my martial compliments.</p>
<p>MEN. By the faith of a knight! What a pox, where are thy spurs?[207]</p>
<p>APP. I need no spurs; I ride, like Pegasus, on a winged horse—on a
swift jennet, my boy, called Fear.</p>
<p>MEN. What shouldst thou fear in the wars? He's not a good soldier that
hath not a good stomach.</p>
<p>APP. O, but the stink of powder spoils Appetitus's stomach, and then
thou knowest, when 'tis gone, Appetitus is dead; therefore I very
manfully drew my sword, and flourished it bravely about mine ears,
hist![208] and finding myself hurt, most manfully ran away.</p>
<p>MEN. All heart indeed, for thou rann'st like a hart out of the field. It
seems, then, the Senses mean to fight it out.</p>
<p>APP. Ay, and outfight themselves, I think; and all about a trifle, a
paltry bauble found, I know not where.</p>
<p>MEN. Thou art deceived: they fight for more than that; a thing called
superiority, of which the crown is but an emblem.</p>
<p>APP. Mendacio, hang this superiority; crown me no crown, but Bacchus's
crown of roses; give me no sceptre but a fat capon's leg, to show that I
am the great king of Hungary! Therefore, I prythee, talk no more of
state-matters: but in brief, tell me, my little rascal, how thou hast
spent thy time this many a day.</p>
<p>MEN. Faith, in some credit, since thou sawest me last.</p>
<p>APP. How so? where?</p>
<p>MEN. Everywhere. In the court your gentlewomen hang me at their
apron-strings, and that makes them answer so readily. In the city I am
honoured like a god; none so well acquainted with your tradesmen. Your
lawyers, all the termtime, hire me of my lady; your gallants, if they
hear my name abused, they stab for my sake; your travellers so doat upon
me as passes.[209] O, they have good reason; for I have carried them to
many a good meal under the countenance of my familiarity. Nay, your
statesmen have oftentimes closely conveyed me under their tongues, to
make their policies more current. As for old men, they challenge my
company by authority.</p>
<p>APP. I am exceeding glad of your great promotion.</p>
<p>MEN. Now, when I am disposed, I can philosophy it in the university with
the subtlest of them all.</p>
<p>APP. I cannot be persuaded that thou art acquainted with scholars, ever
since thou wert pressed to death in a printing-house.</p>
<p>MEN. No? why, I was the first founder of the three sects of philosophy,
except one of the Peripatetics, who acknowledge Aristotle, I confess,
their great grandfather.</p>
<p>APP. Thou boy! how is this possible? Thou art but a child, and there
were sects of philosophy, before thou wert born.</p>
<p>MEN. Appetitus, thou mistakest me. I tell thee, three thousand years ago
was Mendacio born in Greece,[210] nursed in Crete, and ever since
honoured everywhere. I'll be sworn I held old Homer's pen, when he writ
his Iliads and his Odysseys.</p>
<p>APP. Thou hadst need, for I hear say he was blind.</p>
<p>MEN. I helped Herodotus to pen some part of his "Muses";[211] lent Pliny
ink to write his history; rounded Rabelais in the ear,[212] when he
historified Pantagruel: as for Lucian, I was his genius. O, those two
books "De Vera Historia," howsoever they go under his name, I'll be
sworn I writ them every tittle.</p>
<p>APP. Sure as I am hungry, thou'st have it for lying. But hast thou
rusted this latter time for want of exercise?</p>
<p>MEN. Nothing less. I must confess I would fain have jogged Stow and
great Hollingshed on their elbows, when they were about their
chronicles; and, as I remember, Sir John Mandeville's "Travels" and a
great part of the "Decads"[213] were of my doing. But for the "Mirror of
Knighthood," "Bevis of Southampton," "Palmerin of England," "Amadis of
Gaul," "Huon de Bordeaux," "Sir Guy of Warwick," "Martin Marprelate,"
"Robin Hood," "Garragantua," "Gerileon," and a thousand such exquisite
monuments as these, no doubt but they breathe in my breath up and down.</p>
<p>APP. Downwards, I'll swear, for there's stinking lies in them.</p>
<p>MEN. But what, should I light a candle to the bright sunshine of my
glorious renown? The whole world is full of Mendacio's fame.</p>
<p>APP. And so it will be so long as the world is full of fame.</p>
<p>MEN. But, sirrah, how hast thou done this long time?</p>
<p>APP. In as much request as thyself. To begin with the court, as thou
didst: I lie with the ladies all night, and that's the reason they call
for cullies and gruellies so early before their prayers. Your gallants
never sup, breakfast, or bever[214] without me.</p>
<p>MEN. That's false, for I have seen them eat with a full stomach.</p>
<p>APP. True, but because they know a little thing drives me from them,
therefore in midst of meat they present me with some sharp sauce or a
dish of delicate anchovies, or a caviare,[215] to entice me back again.
Nay, more: your old sires, that hardly go without a prop, will walk a
mile or two every day to renew their acquaintance with me. As for the
academy, it is beholding to me for adding the eighth province unto the
noble Heptarchy of the liberal sciences.[216]</p>
<p>MEN. What's that, I prythee?</p>
<p>APP. The most desired and honourable art of cookery. Now, sirrah, in the
city I am———'st, 'st! O, the body of a louse!</p>
<p>MEN. What, art a louse in the city?</p>
<p>APP. Not a word more; for yonder comes Phantastes and somebody else.</p>
<p>MEN. What a pox can Phantastes do?</p>
<p>APP. Work a miracle, if he would prove wise.</p>
<p>MEN. 'Tis he indeed, the vilest nup.[217] Yet the fool loves me
exceedingly; but I care not for his company, for if he once catch me,
I shall never be rid of him.</p>

<p>HEU. Three things have troubled my brain this many a day, and just now,
when I was laying hold on the invention of them, your sudden call made
them, like Tantalus's apples, fly from my fingers.</p>
<p>PHA. Some great matters, questionless; what were they?</p>
<p>HEU. The quadrature of a circle, the philosopher's stone, and the next
way to the Indies.</p>
<p>PHA. Thou dost well to meditate on these three things at once, for
they'll be found out altogether—<emphasis>ad Graecas Calendas</emphasis>; but let them
pass, and carry the conceit I told you this morning to the party you wot
of. In my imagination 'tis capricious; 'twill take, I warrant thee.</p>
<p>HEU. I will, sir. But what say you to the gentleman that was with you
yesterday?</p>
<p>PHA. O, I think thou meanest him that made nineteen sonnets of his
mistress's busk-point.[219]</p>
<p>HEU. The same, the same, sir. You promised to help him out with the
twentieth.</p>

heart</emphasis>.</p>
<p>HEU. But what trick shall I invent for the conclusion?</p>
<p>PHA. Pish, anything, love will minister ink for the rest. He that [hath]
once begun well, hath half done; let him begin again, and there's all.</p>
<p>HEU. Master Gullio spoke for a new fashion; what for him?</p>
<p>PHA. A fashion for his suit! Let him button it down the sleeve with four
elbows, and so make it the pure hieroglyphic of a fool.</p>
<p>HEU. Nay, then let me request one thing of you.</p>
<p>PHA. What's that, boy? By this fair hand, thou shalt have it.</p>
<p>HEU. Mistress Superbia, a gentlewoman of my acquaintance, wished me to
devise her a new set for her ruff and an odd tire. I pray, sir, help me
out with it.</p>
<p>PHA. Ah, boy, in my conceit 'tis a hard matter to perform. These women
have well-nigh tired me with devising tires for them, and set me at a
nonplus for new sets. Their heads are so light, and their eyes so coy,
that I know not how to please them.</p>
<p>HEU. I pray, sir, she hath a bad face, and fain would have suitors.
Fantastical and odd apparel would perchance draw somebody to look on
her.</p>

Bid her wear the multitude of her deformities under a mask, till my
leisure will serve to devise some durable and unstained blush of
painting.</p>
<p>HEU. Very good, sir.</p>
<p>PHA. Away, then, hie thee again; meet me at the court within this hour
at the farthest. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> HEURESIS.] O heavens! how have I been troubled
these latter times with women, fools, babes, tailors, poets, swaggerers,
gulls, ballad-makers! They have almost disrobed me of all the toys and
trifles I can devise. Were it not that I pity the multitude of printers,
these sonnet-mongers should starve for conceits for all Phantastes. But
these puling lovers—I cannot but laugh at them, and their encomiums of
their mistresses. They make, forsooth, her hair of gold, her eyes of
diamond, her cheeks of roses, her lips of rubies, her teeth of pearl,
and her whole body of ivory; and when they have thus idoled her like
Pygmalion, they fall down and worship her.[222] Psyche, thou hast laid a
hard task upon my shoulders to invent at every one's ask. Were it not
that I refresh my dulness once a day with thy most angelical presence,
'twere impossible for me to undergo it.</p>

<p><strong>    COMMUNIS SENSUS, PHANTASTES.</strong></p>
<p>COM. SEN. I cannot stay, I tell you. 'Tis more than time I were at
court. I know my sovereign Psyche hath expected me this hour.</p>
<p>PHA. In good time; yonder comes Common Sense. I imagine it should be
he by his voice.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Crave my counsel! Tell me what manner of man he is? Can he
entertain a man in his house? Can he hold his velvet cap in one hand,
and vail[223] his bonnet with the other? Knows he how to become a
scarlet gown? Hath he a pair of fresh posts at his door?[224]</p>
<p>PHA. He's about some hasty state matters. He talks of posts, methinks.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Can he part a couple of dogs brawling in the street? Why,
then, choose him mayor. Upon my credit, he'll prove a wise officer.</p>
<p>PHA. Save you, my lord; I have attended your leisure this hour.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Fie upon't! What a toil have I had to choose them a mayor
yonder? There's a fusty currier will have this man; there's a chandler
wipes his nose on his sleeve, and swears it shall not be so; there's a
mustard-maker looks as keen as vinegar will have another. O, this
many-headed multitude, 'tis a hard matter to please them!</p>
<p>PHA. Especially where the multitude is so well-headed. But I pray you,
where's Master Memory? Hath he forgotten himself, that he is not here?</p>
<p>COM. SEN. 'Tis high time he were at court. I would he would come.</p>

<p>MEM. How soon a wise man shall have his wish!</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Memory, the season of your coming is very ripe.</p>
<p>PHA. Had you stayed a little longer, 'twould have been stark rotten.</p>
<p>MEM. I am glad I saved it from the swine. 'Sprecious, I have forgot
something. O, my purse, my purse! Why, Anamnestes, Remembrance? that
wild boy is always gadding. I remember he was at my heels even now, and
now the vile rascal is vanished.</p>

<p>MEM. Ha, sirrah, what a brawling's here?</p>
<p>ANA. I do but give you an answer with, anon, sir.</p>
<p>MEM. You answer sweetly; I have called you three or four times one
after another.</p>
<p>ANA. Sir, I hope I answered you three or four times, one in the neck of
another. But if your good worship have lent me any more calls, tell me,
and I'll repay them, as I'm a gentleman.</p>
<p>MEM. Leave your tattle. Had you come at first, I had not spent so much
breath in vain.</p>
<p>ANA. The truth is, sir, the first time you called I heard you not: the
second, I understood you not: the third, I knew not whether it were you
or no: the fourth, I could not tell where you were, and that's the
reason I answered so suddenly.</p>

                                                  [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> ANAMNESTES.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Come, good Master Register, I wonder you be so late now-a-days.</p>
<p>MEM. My good lord, I remember that I knew your grandfather in this your
place, and I remember your grandfather's great grandfather's
grandfather's father's father; yet in those days I never remember that
any of them could say that Register Memory ever broke one minute of his
appointment.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Why, good father, why are you so late now-a-days?</p>
<p>MEM. Thus 'tis; the most customers I remember myself to have, are, as
your lordship knows, scholars; and now-a-days the most of them are
become critics, bringing me home such paltry things to lay up for them,
that I can hardly find them again.</p>
<p>PHA. Jupiter, Jupiter, I had thought these flies had bit none but
myself: do critics tickle you, i'faith?</p>
<p>MEM. Very familiarly: for they must know of me, forsooth, how every idle
word is written in all the musty moth-eaten manuscripts, kept in all the
old libraries in every city betwixt England and Peru.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Indeed, I have noted these times to affect antiquities more
than is requisite.</p>
<p>MEM. I remember, in the age of Assaracus and Ninus, and about the wars
of Thebes and the siege of Troy, there were few things committed to my
charge, but those that were well worthy the preserving; but now every
trifle must be wrapped up in the volume of eternity. A rich pudding-wife
or a cobbler cannot die but I must immortalise his name with an epitaph;
a dog cannot piss in a nobleman's shoe, but it must be sprinkled into
the chronicles; so that I never could remember my treasure more full,
and never emptier of honourable and true heroical actions.</p>
<p>PHA. By your leave, Memory, you are not alone troubled; chronologers
many of them are so fantastic, as when they bring a captain to the
combat, lifting up his revengeful arm to dispart the head of his enemy,
they'll hold up his arms so long, till they have bestowed three or four
pages in describing the gold hilts of his threatening falchion: so that
in my fancy the reader may well wonder his adversary stabs him not,
before he strikes. Moreover, they are become most palpable flatterers,
always begging at my gates for invention.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. This is a great fault in a chronologer to turn parasite: an
absolute historian should be in fear of none;[227] neither should he
write anything more than truth for friendship, or less for hate; but
keep himself equal and constant in all his discourses. But, for us, we
must be contented; for, as our honours increase, so must the burthen of
the cares of our offices urge us to wax heavy.</p>
<p>PHA. But not till our backs break; 'slud, there was never any so haunted
as I am: this day there comes a sophister to my house, knocks at my
door; his errand being asked, forsooth his answer was to borrow a fair
suit of conceits out of my wardrobe, to apparel a show he had in hand:
and what think you is the plot?</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Nay, I know not, for I am little acquainted with such toys.</p>
<p>PHA. Meanwhile, he's somewhat acquainted with you, for he's bold to
bring your person upon the stage.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. What, me? I can't remember that I was ever brought upon the
stage before.</p>
<p>PHA. Yes, you, and you, and myself with all my fantastical tricks and
humours: but I trow I have fitted him with fooleries: I trust he'll
never trouble me again.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. O times! O manners! when boys dare to traduce men in
authority; was ever such an attempt heard?</p>
<p>MEM. I remember there was: for, to say the truth, at my last being at
Athens—it is now, let me see, about one thousand eight hundred years
ago—I was at a comedy of Aristophanes' making.[228] I shall never
forget it; the arch-governor of Athens took me by the hand, and placed
me; and there, I say, I saw Socrates abused most grossly, himself being
then a present spectator: I remember he sat full against me, and did not
so much as show the least countenance of discontent.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. In those days it was lawful; but now the abuse of such liberty
is insufferable.</p>
<p>PHA. Think what you will of it, I think 'tis done, and I think it is
acting by this time: hark, hark; what drumming's yonder! I'll lay my
life they are come to present the show I spake of.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. It may be so; stay, we'll see what 'tis.</p>

all past overtaking.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Is not this Lingua, that is in such haste?</p>
<p>PHA. Yes, yes, stand still.</p>
<p>MEN. I must speak with him.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. With whom?</p>
<p>MEN. Assure yourself they are all at court ere this.</p>
<p>LIN. Run after them, for, unless he know it—</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Lingua!</p>
<p>LIN. O, is't your lordship? I beseech you, pardon me. Haste and fear, I
protest, put out mine eyes: I looked so long for you, that I knew not,
when I had found you.</p>
<p>PHA. In my conceit that's like the man that inquired who saw his ass,
when himself rid on him.</p>
<p>LIN. O, my heart beats so! fie, fie, fie, fie!</p>
<p>MEN. I am so weary; so, so, so, so.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. I prythee, Lingua, make an end.</p>
<p>LIN. Let me begin first, I beseech you; but if you will needs have the
end first—thus 'tis: the commonwealth of Microcosm at this instant
suffers the pangs of death, 'tis gasping for breath. Will you have all?
'tis poisoned.</p>
<p>PHA. What apothecary durst be so bold as make such a confection? ha,
what poison is't?</p>
<p>LIN. A golden crown.</p>
<p>MEN. I mistake; or else Galen, in his book "De Sanitate Tuenda,"
commends gold as restorative.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Lingua, express yourself.</p>
<p>MEN. Madam, if you want breath, let me help you out.</p>
<p>LIN. I prythee do, do.</p>
<p>MEN. My lord, the report is that Mercury, coming late into this country,
in this very place left a coronet with this inscription, <emphasis>that the best

<p>LIN. Challenge each other, and are now in arms, and't like your

<p>COM. SEN. I protest it likes not me.</p>
<p>LIN. Their battles are not far hence; ready ranged.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. O monstrous presumption! what shall we do?</p>
<p>MEM. My lord, in your great grandfather's time there was, I remember,
such a breach amongst them; therefore my counsel is that, after his
example, by the strength of your authority you convene them before you.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Lingua, go presently; command the Senses, upon their
allegiance to our dread sovereign Queen Psyche, to dismiss their
companies, and personally to appear before me without any pretence of
excuse.</p>
<p>LIN. I go, my lord.</p>

with us a little, till you return again.</p>

<p>

But O, 'tis far beyond my reach of wit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or strength of utterance to describe their forces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>COM. SEN. Go to; speak what thou canst.</p>
<p>MEN. Upon the right hand of a spacious hill</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Proud Visus marshalleth a puissant army,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Three thousand eagles strong, whose valiant captain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is Jove's swift thunder-bearer, that same bird,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That hoist up Ganymede from the Trojan plains.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The vanguard strengthened with a wondrous flight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of falcons, haggards, hobbies, terselets,[231]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lanards and goshawks, sparhawks, and ravenous birds.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The rearward granted to Auditus' charge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is stoutly follow'd with an impetuous herd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of stiff-neck'd bulls and many horn-mad stags,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the best head the forest can afford.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. I promise you, a fearful troop of soldiers.</p>
<p>MEN. Right opposite stands Tactus, strongly mann'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With three thousand bristled urchens[232] for his pikemen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Four hundred tortoises for elephants;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Besides a monstrous troop of ugly spiders,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within an ambushment he hath commanded</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of their own guts to spin a cordage fine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whereof t'have fram'd a net (O wondrous work!)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That, fastened by the concave of the moon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Spreads down itself to th'earth's circumference.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MEM. 'Tis very strange; I cannot remember the like engine at any time.</p>
<p>MEN. Nay more, my lord, the masks[233] are made so strong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I myself upon them scal'd the heavens,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And boldly walk'd about the middle region,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where, in the province of the meteors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw the cloudy shops of hail and rain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Garners of snow, and crystals full of dew;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rivers of burning arrows, dens of dragons,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Huge beams of flames, and spears like firebrands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where I beheld hot Mars and Mercury,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With rackets made of spheres and balls of stars,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Playing at tennis for a tun of Nectar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that vast gaping of the firmament</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Under the southern pole is nothing else</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But the great hazard[234] of their tennis-court;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Zodiac is the line; the shooting stars,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which in an eye-bright evening seem to fall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are nothing but the balls they lose at bandy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus, having took my pleasure with those sights,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By the same net I went up I descended.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>COM. SEN. Well, sirrah, to what purpose tends this stratagem?</p>
<p>MEN. None know directly; but I think it is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'entrap the eagles, when the battles join.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. Who takes Tactus his part?</p>
<p>MEN. Under the standard of thrice-hardy Tactus,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thrice-valiant Gustus leads his warlike forces;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An endless multitude of desperate apes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Five hundred marmosets and long-tail'd monkeys,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All trained to the field, and nimble gunners.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. I imagine there's old moving[235] amongst them: methinks a handful
of nuts would turn them all out of their soldiers' coats.</p>
<p>MEN. Ramparts of pasty-crust and forts of pies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Entrench'd with dishes full of custard stuff,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath Gustus made, and planted ordinance—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Strange ordinance, cannons of hollow canes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose powder's rape-seed, charg'd with turnip-shot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MEM. I remember, in the country of Utopia[236] they use no other kind of
artillery.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. But what's become of Olfactus?</p>
<p>MEN. He politicly leans to neither part,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But stands betwixt the camps as at receipt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Having great swine[237] his pioneers to entrench them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. In my foolish imagination Olfactus is very like the Goddess of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Victory, that never takes any part but the conqueror's.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MEN. And in the woods be[238] placed secretly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two hundred couple of hounds and hungry mastiffs;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er his head hover at his command</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A cloud of vultures, which o'erspread the light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Making a night before the day be done:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But to what end not known, but fear'd of all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. I conjecture he intends to see them fight, and after the battle to
feed his dogs, hogs, and vultures upon the murdered carcases.</p>
<p>MEN. My lord, I think the fury of their anger will not be obedient to
the message of Lingua; for otherwise, in my conceit, they should have
been here ere this. With your lordship's good liking, we'll attend upon
you to see the field for more certainty.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. It shall be so; come, Master Register, let's walk.</p>

ha! is he not here? O excellent! would I were hanged, but I looked for a
sound rap on the pate, and that made me beforehand to lift up this
excuse for a buckler. I know he's not at court, for here is his purse,
without which warrant there's no coming thither; wherefore now,
Anamnestes, sport thyself a little, while thou art out of the prison of
his company. What shall I do? by my troth, anatomise his purse in his
absence. Plutus send there be jewels in it, that I may finely geld it of
the stones—the best, sure, lies in the bottom; pox on't, here's nothing
but a company of worm-eaten papers: what's this? Memorandum that Master
Prodigo owes me four thousand pounds, and that his lands are in pawn for
it. Memorandum that I owe. That he owes? 'Tis well the old slave hath
some care of his credit; to whom owes he, trow I? that I owe Anamnestes;
what, me? I never lent him anything; ha, this is good, there's something
coming to me more than I looked for. Come on; what is't? Memorandum that
I owe Anamnestes———a breeching;[239] i'faith, sir, I will ease you
of that payment. [<emphasis>He rends the bill</emphasis>.] Memorandum that, when I was a
child, Robusto tripped up my heels at football: what a revengeful
dizard[240] is this?</p>

<p>    MENDACIO, <emphasis>with cushions under his arms,

<p><strong>    MENDACIO, ANAMNESTES.</strong></p>
<p>ANA. How now?</p>
<p>MEN. Nothing, but lay you upon the cushion, sir, or so.</p>
<p>ANA. Nothing, but lay the cushion upon you, sir.</p>
<p>MEN, What, my little Nam? By this foot, I am sorry I mistook thee.</p>
<p>ANA. What, my little Men? By this hand, it grieves me I took thee so
right. But, sirrah, whither with these cushions?</p>
<p>MEN. To lay them here, that the judges may sit softly, lest my Lady</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lingua's cause go hard with her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ANA. They should have been wrought with gold; these will do nothing. But
what makes my lady with the judges?</p>
<p>MEN. Pish! know'st not? She sueth for the title of a Sense, as well as
the rest that bear the name of the Pentarchy.</p>
<p>ANA. Will Common Sense and my master leave their affairs to determine
that controversy?</p>
<p>MEN. Then thou hear'st nothing.</p>
<p>ANA. What should I hear?</p>
<p>MEN. All the Senses fell out about a crown fallen from heaven, and
pitched a field for it; but Vicegerent Common Sense, hearing of it, took
upon him to umpire the contention, in which regard he hath appointed
them (their arms dismissed) to appear before him, charging every one to
bring, as it were in a show, their proper objects, that by them he may
determine of their several excellencies.</p>
<p>ANA. When is all this?</p>
<p>MEN. As soon as they can possibly provide.</p>
<p>ANA. But can he tell which deserves best by their objects?</p>
<p>MEN. No, not only; for every Sense must describe his instrument, that
is, his house, where he performs his daily duty, so that by the object
and the instrument my lord can with great ease discern their place and
dignities.</p>
<p>ANA. His lordship's very wise.</p>
<p>MEN. Thou shalt hear all anon. Fine Master Phantastes and thy master
will be here shortly. But how is't, my little rogue? methinks thou
look'st lean upon't!</p>
<p>ANA. Alas! how should I do otherwise, that lie all night with such a
raw-boned skeleton as Memory, and run all day on his errands? The
churl's grown so old and forgetful, that every hour he's calling,
Anamnestes, Remembrance; where art, Anamnestes? Then presently
something's lost. Poor I must run for it, and these words, <emphasis>Run, boy;
come, sirrah, quick, quick, quick</emphasis>! are as familiar with him as the
cough, never out on's mouth.</p>
<p>MEN. Alack, alack! poor rogue, I see my fortunes are better. My lady
loves me exceedingly; she's always kissing me, so that I tell thee, Nam,
Mendacio's never from betwixt her lips.</p>
<p>ANA. Nor I out of Memory's mouth,[241] but in a worse sort, always
exercising my stumps, and, which is more, when he favours best, then I
am in the worst taking.</p>
<p>MEN. How so?</p>
<p>ANA. Thus: when we are friends, then must I come and be dandled upon his
palsy-quaking knees, and he'll tell me a long story of his acquaintance
with King Priamus and his familiarity with Nestor, and how he played at
blowpoint[242] with Jupiter, when he was in his sidecoats, and how he
went to look bird-nests with Athous,[243] and where he was at
Deucalion's flood, and twenty such old wives' tales.</p>
<p>MEN. I wonder he, being so old, can talk so much.</p>
<p>ANA. Nature, thou know'st, knowing what an unruly engine the tongue is,
hath set teeth round about for watchmen. Now, sir, my master's old age
hath coughed out all his teeth, and that's the cause it runs so much at
liberty.</p>
<p>MEN. Philosophical!</p>
<p>ANA. O, but there's one thing stings me to the very heart—to see an
ugly, foul, idle, fat, dusty cloghead, called Oblivio, preferred before
me. Dost know him?</p>
<p>MEN. Who, I? Ay, but care not for his acquaintance. Hang him, blockhead!
I could never abide him. Thou, Remembrance, are the only friend that the
arms of my friendship shall embrace. Thou hast heard <emphasis>Oportet mendacem
esse memorem</emphasis>. But what of Oblivio?</p>
<p>ANA. The very naming of him hath made me forget myself. O, O, O, O, that
rascal is so made of everywhere!</p>
<p>MEN. Who, Oblivio?</p>
<p>ANA. Ay, for our courtiers hug him continually in their ungrateful
bosoms, and your smooth-bellied,[244] fat-backed, barrel-paunched,
tun-gutted drones are never without him. As for Memory, he's a
false-hearted fellow; he always deceives them; they respect not him,
except it be to play a game at chests,[245] primero,[246] saunt,[247]
maw,[248] or such like.</p>

never got anything to forget.</p>
<p>ANA. Again, these prodigal swaggerers that are so much bound to their
creditors, if they have but one cross about them, they'll spend it in
wine upon Oblivio.</p>
<p>MEN. To what purpose, I prythee?</p>
<p>ANA. Only in hope he'll wash them in the Lethe of their cares.</p>
<p>MEN. Why, then, no man cares for thee.</p>
<p>ANA. Yes, a company of studious paperworms and lean scholars, and
niggarly scraping usurers, and a troop of heart-eating, envious persons,
and those canker-stomached, spiteful creatures that furnish up
commonplace books with other men's faults. The time hath been, in those
golden days when Saturn reigned, that, if a man received a benefit of
another, I was presently sent for to put him in mind of it; but now, in
these iron afternoons, save your friend's life, and Oblivio will be more
familiar with him than you.</p>

<p>HEU. Phantastes not at court? Is't possible? 'Tis the strangest accident
that ever was heard of. I had thought the ladies and gallants would
never lie without him.</p>
<p>ANA. Hist, hist, Mendacio; I prythee observe Heuresis. It seems he
cannot find his master, that's able to find out all things. And art thou
now at a fault? Canst not find out thine own master?</p>
<p>HEU. I'll try one more way. O yes![249]</p>

<p>ANA. Ay, ay, his nimble head is always full of proclamations.</p>

<p>ANA. O good sir, and good reason, for every beast hath Phantasy at his
pleasure.</p>
<p>HEU. O yes! If any man can tell any tidings of a spruce, neat, apish,
nimble, fine, foolish, absurd, humorous, conceited, fantastic gallant,
with hollow eyes, sharp look, swart complexion, meagre face, wearing as
many toys in his apparel as fooleries in his looks and gesture, let him
come forth and certify me thereof, and he shall have for his
reward—</p>
<p>ANA. I can tell you where he is. What shall he have?</p>
<p>HEU. A box o' the ear, sirrah.    [<emphasis>Snap</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>ANA. How now, Invention, are you so quick-fingered? I'faith, there's
your principal, sirrah, [<emphasis>snap</emphasis>], and here's the interest ready in my

<p>ANA. An't like your worship, your cloghead Oblivio went before me, and
foiled the trail of your footsteps, that I could hardly undertake the

hither: what, must you go round about? Goodly, goodly, you are full of

the city, sought you in every alehouse, inn, tavern, dicing-house,
tennis-court, stews, and such like places, likely to find your worship
in.</p>
<p>MEM. Ha, villain! am I a man likely to be found in such places, ha?</p>

worship was seeking me; therefore I inquired for you in those places,
where I knew you would ask for me, an it please your worship.</p>

<p>SCAENA QUINTA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    COMMUNIS SENSUS, LINGUA, PHANTASTES, MEMORY, ANAMNESTES.</strong></p>
<p>COM. SEN. Lingua, the Senses, by our appointment, anon are to present
their objects before us. Seeing, therefore, they be not in readiness, we
license you in the meanwhile, either in your own person or by your
advocate, to speak what you can for yourself.</p>
<p>LIN. My lord, if I should bring before your honour all my friends, ready
to importune you in my behalf, I should have so many rhetoricians,
logicians, lawyers, and (which is more) so many women, to attend me,
that this grove would hardly contain the company; wherefore, to avoid
the tediousness, I will lay the whole cause upon the tip of mine own
tongue.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Be as brief as the necessity of our short time requires.</p>
<p>LIN. My lord, though the <emphasis>imbecillitas</emphasis> of my feeble sex might draw me
back from this tribunal, with the <emphasis>habenis</emphasis>, to wit <emphasis>timoris</emphasis> and the
<emphasis>Catenis pudoris</emphasis>, notwithstanding being so fairly led on with the
gracious [Greek: epiecheia] of your <emphasis>justissime</emphasis> [Greek: dikaiosynaes].
Especially so <emphasis>aspremente spurd' con gli sproni di necessita mia
pugente</emphasis>, I will without the help of orators commit the <emphasis>totam salutem</emphasis>
of my action to the <emphasis>volutabilitati</emphasis> [Greek: ton gynaicheion logon],
which <emphasis>avec vostre bonne plaisir</emphasis>, I will finish with more than
<emphasis>Laconicâ brevitate</emphasis>.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. What's this? here's a gallimaufry of speech indeed.</p>
<p>MEM. I remember about the year 1602 many used this skew kind of language
which, in my opinion, is not much unlike the man Platony,[251] the son
of Lagus, king of Egypt, brought for a spectacle, half-white, half-black.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. I am persuaded these same language-makers have the very
quality of cold in their wit, that freezeth all heterogeneal languages
together, congealing English tin, Grecian gold, Roman latten[252] all in
a lump.</p>
<p>PHA. Or rather, in my imagination, like your fantastical gull's apparel,
wearing a Spanish felt, a French doublet, a Granado stocking, a Dutch
slop, an Italian cloak, with a Welsh freeze jerkin.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Well, leave your toying: we cannot pluck the least feather
from the soft wing of time. Therefore, Lingua, go on, but in a less
formal manner. You know an ingenious oration must neither swell above
the banks with insolent words, nor creep too shallow in the ford with
vulgar terms; but run equally, smooth and cheerful, through the clean
current of a pure style.</p>
<p>LIN. My lord, this one thing is sufficient to confirm my worth to be
equal or better than the Senses, whose best operations are nothing till
I polish them with perfection; for their knowledge is only of things
present, quickly sublimed with the deft[253] file of time: whereas the
tongue is able to recount things past, and often pronounce things to
come, by this means re-edifying such excellences as time and age do
easily depopulate.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. But what profitable service do you undertake for our dread
queen Psyche?</p>
<p>LIN. O, how I am ravished to think how infinitely she hath graced me
with her most acceptable service! But above all (which you, Master
Register, well remember), when her highness, taking my mouth for her
instrument, with the bow of my tongue struck so heavenly a touch upon my
teeth, that she charmed the very tigers asleep, the listening bears and
lions to couch at her feet, while the hills leaped, and the woods danced
to the sweet harmony of her most angelical accents.</p>
<p>MEM. I remember it very well. Orpheus played upon the harp, while she
sung, about some four years after the contention betwixt Apollo and Pan,
and a little before the excoriation of Marsyas.</p>
<p>ANA. By the same token the river Alpheus, at that time pursuing his
beloved Arethusa, dischannelled himself of his former course, to be
partaker of their admirable consort[254], and the music being ended,
thrust himself headlong into earth, the next way to follow his amorous
chace. If you go to Arcadia, you shall see his coming up again.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Forward, Lingua, with your reason.</p>
<p>LIN. How oft hath her excellency employed me as ambassador in her most
urgent affairs to foreign kings and emperors—I may say to the gods
themselves? How many bloodless battles have my persuasions attained,
when the Senses' forces have been vanquished? how many rebels have I
reclaimed, when her sacred authority was little regarded? Her laws
(without exprobation be it spoken) had been altogether unpublished, her
will unperformed, her illustrious deeds unrenowned, had not the silver
sound of my trumpet filled the whole circuit of the universe with her
deserved fame. Her cities would dissolve, traffic would decay,
friendships be broken, were not my speech the knot, mercury, and mastic,
to bind, defend, and glue them together. What should I say more? I can
never speak enough of the unspeakable praise of speech, wherein I can
find no other imperfection at all, but that the most exquisite power and
excellency of speech cannot sufficiently express the exquisite power and
excellency of speaking.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Lingua, your service and dignity we confess to be great;
nevertheless these reasons prove you not to have the nature of a Sense.</p>
<p>LIN. By your ladyship's favour, I can soon prove that a Sense is a
faculty, by which our queen sitting in her privy chamber hath
intelligence of exterior occurrences. That I am of this nature, I prove
thus. The object which I challenge is—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> APPETITUS <emphasis>in haste</emphasis>.</p>
<p>APP. Stay, stay, my lord; defer, I beseech you, defer the judgment.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Who's this that boldly interrupts us thus?</p>
<p>APP. My name is Appetitus, common servant to the pentarchy of the Senses
who, understanding that your honour was handling this action of
Lingua's, sent me hither thus hastily, most humbly requesting the Bench
to consider these articles they allege against her, before you proceed
to judgment.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Hum, here's good stuff; Master Register, read them. Appetitus,
you may depart, and bid your mistress make convenient speed.</p>
<p>APP. At your lordship's pleasure.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> APPETITUS.</p>
<p>MEM. I remember that I forgot my spectacles; I left them in the 349th
page of Hall's "Chronicles," where he tells a great wonder of a
multitude of mice, which had almost destroyed the country, but that
there resorted a great mighty flight of owls, that destroyed them.
Anamnestes, read these articles distinctly.</p>
<p>ANA. Art. 1. Imprimis, We accuse Lingua of high treason and sacrilege
against the most honourable commonwealth of letters; for, under pretence
of profiting the people with translations, she hath most vilely
prostituted the hard mysteries of unknown languages to the profane ears
of the vulgar.</p>
<p>PHA. This is as much as to make a new hell in the upper world; for in
hell they say Alexander is no better than a cobbler, and now by these
translations every cobbler is as familiar with Alexander as he that
wrote his life.</p>
<p>ANA. Art. 2. Item, that she hath wrongfully imprisoned a lady called</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Veritas.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Art. 3. Item, That she's a witch, and exerciseth her tongue in exorcisms.</p>
<p>Art. 4. Item, That she's a common whore, and lets every one lie with her.</p>
<p>Art. 5. Item, that she rails on men in authority, depraving their honours
with bitter jests and taunts; and that she's a backbiter, setting strife
betwixt bosom friends.</p>
<p>Art. 6. Item, that she lends wives weapons to fight against their
husbands.</p>
<p>Art. 7. Item, that she maintains a train of prating pettifoggers,
prowling sumners[255], smooth-tongued bawds, artless[256] empirics,
hungry parasites, newscarriers, janglers[257], and such like idle
companions, that delude the commonalty.</p>
<p>Art. 8. Item, that she made rhetoric wanton, logic to babble, astronomy
to lie.</p>
<p>Art. 9. Item that she's an incontinent tell-tale.</p>
<p>Art. 10. Item (which is the last and worst), that she's a woman in every
respect, and for these causes not to be admitted to the dignity of a
Sense. That these articles be true, we pawn our honours, and subscribe
our names.</p>

Makes the abashed heavens soon to shun</p>
<empty-line/>

The ugly darkness it embrac'd beforn;[258]</p>

The utmost relics of the hell-born night.</p>

To wanderers by sea and land gives aid;</p>

And all the skill in deep astronomy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. Visus, you have made Coelum a heavenly speech, past earthly
capacity; it had been as good for him he had thundered. But I pray
you, who taught him to speak and use no action? methinks it had been
excellent to have turned round about in his speech.</p>
<p>VIS. He hath so many motions, he knows not which to begin withal.</p>

<p>MEM. You are deceived; for I remember, when Phaeton ruled the sun (I
shall never forget him, he was a very pretty youth), the Earth opened
her mouth wide, and spoke a very good speech to Jupiter.</p>
<p>ANA. By the same token Nilus hid his head then, he could never find it
since.</p>
<p>PHA. You know, Memory, that was an extreme hot day, and 'tis likely
Terra sweat much, and so took cold presently after, that ever since she
hath lost her voice.</p>
<p>HER. A canton ermine added to the field</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is a sure sign the man that bore these arms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was to his prince as a defensive shield,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Saving him from the force of present harms[260].</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. I know this fellow of old, 'tis a herald: many a centaur,
chimaera[261], barnacle[262], crocodile, hippopotame, and such like
toys hath he stolen out of the shop of my Invention, to shape new coats
for his upstart gentlemen. Either Africa must breed more monsters,[263]
or you make fewer gentlemen, Master Herald, for you have spent all my
devices already. But since you are here, let me ask you a question in
your own profession: how comes it to pass that the victorious arms of
England, quartered with the conquered coat of France, are not placed on
the dexter side, but give the flower-de-luce the better hand?</p>
<p>HER. Because that the three lions are one coat made of two French
dukedoms, Normandy and Aquitain.</p>
<p>[PHA.][264] But I pray you, Visus, what joy is that, that follows him?</p>
<p>VIS. 'Tis Colour, an object of mine, subject to his commandment.</p>
<p>PHA. Why speaks he not?</p>
<p>VIS. He is so bashful, he dares not speak for blushing:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What thing is that? tell me without delay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BOY. That's nothing of itself, yet every way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As like a man as a thing like may be:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet so unlike as clean contrary,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For in one point it every way doth miss,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The right side of it a man's left side is;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis lighter than a feather, and withal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It fills no place nor room, it is so small.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>COM. SEN. How now, Visus, have you brought a boy with a riddle to pose
us all?</p>
<p>PHA. Pose us all, and I here? That were a jest indeed. My lord, if he
have a Sphinx, I have an Oedipus, assure yourself; let's hear it once
again.</p>
<p>BOY. What thing is that, sir, &amp;c.</p>
<p>PHA. This such a knotty enigma? Why, my lord, I think 'tis a woman, for
first a woman is nothing of herself, and, again, she is likest a man of
anything.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. But wherein is she unlike?</p>
<p>PHA. In everything: in peevishness, in folly. 'St, boy?</p>
<p>HEU. In pride, deceit, prating, lying, cogging, coyness, spite, hate,
sir.</p>
<p>PHA. And in many more such vices. Now, he may well say, the left side a
man's right side is, for a cross wife is always contrary to her husband,
ever contradicting what he wisheth for, like to the verse in Martial,
<emphasis>Velle tuum</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MEM. <emphasis>Velle tuum nolo, Dindyme, nolle volo</emphasis>.</p>
<p>PHA. Lighter than a feather—doth any man make question of that?</p>
<p>MEM. They need not, for I remember I saw a cardinal weigh them once, and
the woman was found three grains lighter.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. 'Tis strange, for I have seen gentlewomen wear feathers
oftentimes. Can they carry heavier things than themselves?</p>
<p>MEM. O, sir, I remember, 'tis their only delight to do so.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. But how apply you the last verse? it fills no place, sir.</p>
<p>PHA. By my faith, that spoils all the former, for these farthingales
take up all the room now-a-days; 'tis not a woman, questionless. Shall I
be put down with a riddle? Sirrah Heuresis, search the corners of your
conceit, and find it me quickly.</p>
<p>HEU. Eh, [Greek: heureka, heureka] I have it: 'tis a man's face in a
looking-glass.</p>
<p>PHA. My lord, 'tis so indeed. Sirrah let's see it, for do you see my
right eye here?</p>
<p>COM. SEN. What of your eye?</p>
<p>PHA. O lord, sir, this kind of frown is excellent, especially when 'tis
sweetened with such a pleasing smile.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Phantastes!</p>
<p>PHA. O sir, my left eye is my right in the glass, do you see? By these
lips, my garters hang so neatly, my gloves and shoes become my hands and
feet so well. Heuresis, tie my shoe-strings with a new knot—this point
was scarce well-trussed, so, 'tis excellent. Looking-glasses were a
passing invention. I protest the fittest books for ladies to study on—</p>
<p>MEM. Take heed you fall not in love with yourself. Phantastes, as I
remember—Anamnestes, who was't that died of the looking disease?</p>
<p>ANA. Forsooth, Narcissus: by the same token he was turned to a daffodil,
and as he died for love of himself, so, if you remember, there was an
old ill-favoured, precious-nosed, babber-lipped, beetle-browed,
blear-eyed, slouch-eared slave that, looking himself by chance in a
glass, died for pure hate.</p>
<p>PHA. By the lip of my —— I could live and die with this face.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Fie, fie, Phantastes, so effeminate! for shame, leave off.
Visus, your objects I must needs say, are admirable, if the house and
instrument be answerable. Let's hear therefore in brief your
description.</p>
<p>VIS. Under the forehead of Mount Cephalou,[265]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That overpeers the coast of Microcosm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All in the shadow of two pleasant groves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stand by two mansion-houses, both as round</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the clear heavens: both twins, as like each other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As star to star, which by the vulgar sort,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For their resplendent composition,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are named the bright eyes of Mount Cephalon:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With four fair rooms those lodgings are contrived,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Four goodly rooms in form most spherical,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Closing each other like the heavenly orbs:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The first whereof, of nature's substance wrought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As a strange moat the other to defend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is trained movable by art divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stirring the whole compacture of the rest:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The second chamber is most curiously</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Compos'd of burnish'd and transparent horn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. That's a matter of nothing. I have known many have such
bed-chambers.</p>
<p>MEM. It may be so, for I remember, being once in the town's library, I
read such a thing in their great book of monuments, called "Cornucopia,"
or rather their "Copiacornu."</p>
<p>VIS. The third's a lesser room of purest glass;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fourth's smallest, but passeth all the former</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In worth of matter: built most sumptuously,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With walls transparent of pure crystalline.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This the soul's mirror and the body's guide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Love's cabinet, bright beacons of the realm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Casements of light, quiver of Cupid's shafts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wherein I sit, and immediately receive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The species of things corporeal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Keeping continual watch and sentinel;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lest foreign hurt invade our Microcosm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And warning give (if pleasant things approach),</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To entertain them. From this costly room</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Leadeth, my lord, an entry to your house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through which I hourly to yourself convey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Matters of wisdom by experience bred:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Art's first invention, pleasant vision,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Deep contemplation, that attires the soul</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In gorgeous robes of flowing literature:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then, if that Visus have deserved best,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let his victorious brow with crown be blest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>COM. SEN. Anamnestes, see who's to come next.</p>
<p>ANA. Presently, my lord.</p>
<p>PHA. Visus, I wonder that amongst all your objects, you presented us
not with Plato's idea, or the sight of Nineveh,[266] Babylon, London, or
some Stourbridge-fair monsters; they would have done passing well. Those
motions, in my imagination, are very delightful.</p>
<p>VIS. I was loth to trouble your honours with such toys, neither could I
provide them in so short a time.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. We will consider your worth; meanwhile, we dismiss you.</p>
<p>      [VISUS <emphasis>leads his show about the stage, and so goeth out with it</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>SCAENA ULTIMA.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    AUDITUS, <emphasis>&amp;c</emphasis>.</p>
<p>AUD. Hark, hark, hark, hark! peace, peace, O, peace! O sweet, admirable,
swanlike, heavenly! hark, O most mellifluous strain! O, what a pleasant
close was there! O fall[267] most delicate!</p>
<p>COM. SEN. How now, Phantastes! is Auditus mad?</p>
<p>PHA. Let him alone, his musical head is always full of old crotchets.</p>
<p>AUD. Did you mark the dainty driving of the last point, an excellent
maintaining of the song; by the choice timpan of mine ear, I never heard
a better! hist, 'st, 'st, hark! why, there's a cadence able to ravish
the dullest stoic.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. I know not what to think on him.</p>
<p>AUD. There how sweetly the plain-song was dissolved into descant, and
how easily they came off with the last rest. Hark, hark, the
bitter'st[268] sweetest achromatic.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Auditus!</p>
<p>AUD. Thanks, good Apollo, for this timely grace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Never couldst thou in fitter hour indulge it:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O more than most musical harmony!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O most admirable concert! have you no ears?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do you not hear this music?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. It may be good; but, in my opinion, they rest too long in the
beginning.</p>
<p>AUD. Are you then deaf? do you not yet perceive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The wondrous sound the heavenly orbs do make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With their continual motion? hark, hark,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O honey-sweet!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>COM. SEN. What tune do they play?</p>
<p>AUD. Why such a tune as never was, nor ever shall be heard.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mark now, now mark: now, now!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. List, list, list.</p>
<p>AUD. Hark! O sweet, sweet, sweet.</p>
<p>PHA. List! how my heart envies my happy ears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hist, by the gold-strung harp of Apollo,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hear the celestial music of the spheres,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As plainly as ever Pythagoras did.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O most excellent diapason! good, good.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It plays <emphasis>Fortune my foe</emphasis>,[269] as distinctly as may be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>COM. SEN. As the fool thinketh, so the bell clinketh. I protest I hear
no more than a post.</p>
<p>PHA. What, the Lavolta![270] eh? nay, if the heavens fiddle, Fancy must
needs dance.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Prythee, sit still, thou must dance nothing but the passing
measures[271]. Memory, do you hear this harmony of the spheres?</p>
<p>MEM. Not now, my lord; but I remember about some four thousand years
ago, when the sky was first made, we heard very perfectly.</p>
<p>ANA. By the same token, the first tune the planets played, I remember
Venus the treble ran sweet division upon Saturn the bass. The first tune
they played was Sellenger's round[272], in memory whereof ever since it
hath been called "the beginning of the world."</p>
<p>COM. SEN. How comes it we cannot hear it now?</p>
<p>MEM. Our ears are so well acquainted with the sound, that we never mark
it. As I remember, the Egyptian Catadupes[273] never heard the roaring
of the fall of Nilus, because the noise was so familiar unto them.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Have you no other objects to judge by than these, Auditus?</p>
<p>AUD. This is the rarest and most exquisite:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Most spherical, divine, angelical;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But since your duller ears cannot perceive it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May it please your lordship to withdraw yourself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto this neighbouring grove: there shall you see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How the sweet treble of the chirping birds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the soft stirring of the moved leaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Running delightful descant to the sound</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the base murmuring of the bubbling brook[274],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Becomes a concert of good instruments;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While twenty babbling echoes round about,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Out of the stony concave of their mouths,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Restore the vanished music of each close,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fill your ears full with redoubled pleasure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>COM. SEN. I will walk with you very willingly, for I grow weary of
sitting. Come, Master Register and Master Phantastes.</p>
<p>                                     [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis> OMNES.</p>

<p><strong>ACTUS QUARTUS, SCAENA PRIMA.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    MENDACIO, ANAMNESTES, HEURESIS.</strong></p>
<p>MEN. Prythee, Nam, be persuaded: is't not better to go to a feast, than
stay here for a fray?</p>
<p>ANA. A feast? dost think Auditus will make the judges a feast?</p>
<p>MEN. Faith, ay. Why should he carry them to his house else?</p>
<p>ANA. Why, sirrah, to hear a set or two of songs: 'slid, his banquets are
nothing but fish, all sol, sol, sol.[275] I'll teach thee wit, boy;
never go thee to a musician's house for junkets, unless thy stomach lies
in thine ears; for there is nothing but commending this song's delicate
air, that ode's dainty air, this sonnet's sweet air, that madrigal's
melting air, this dirge's mournful air: this church air, that chamber
air: French air, English air, Italian air. Why, lad, they be pure
camelions; they feed only upon air.</p>
<p>MEN. Camelions? I'll be sworn some of your fiddlers be rather camels,
for by their good wills they will never leave eating.</p>
<p>ANA. True, and good reason, for they do nothing all the day but stretch
and grate their small guts. But, O, yonder's the ape Heuresis; let me
go, I prythee.</p>
<p>MEN. Nay, good-now, stay a little, let's see his humour.</p>
<p>HEU. I see no reason to the contrary, for we see the quintessence of
wine will convert water into wine; why therefore should not the elixir
of gold turn lead into pure gold?    [<emphasis>Soliloquises</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>MEN. Ha, ha, ha, ha! He is turned chemic, sirrah; it seems so by his
talk.</p>
<p>HEU. But how shall I devise to blow the fire of beechcoals with a
continual and equal blast? ha? I will have my bellows driven with a
wheel, which wheel shall be a self-mover.</p>
<p>ANA. Here's old turning[276]; these chemics, seeking to turn lead into
gold, turn away all their own silver.</p>
<p>HEU. And my wheel shall be geometrically proportioned into seven or nine
concave encircled arms, wherein I will put equal poises: ay, ay; [Greek:
heureka, heureka] I have it, I have it, I have it.</p>
<p>MEN. Heuresis!</p>
<p>HEU. But what's best to contain the quicksilver, ha?</p>
<p>ANA. Do you remember your promise, Heuresis?</p>
<p>HEU. It must not be iron; for quicksilver is the tyrant of metals, and
will soon fret it.</p>
<p>ANA. Heuresis? Heuresis?</p>
<p>HEU. Nor brass, nor copper, nor mastlin[277], nor mineral: [Greek:
heureka, heureka] I have it, I have it, it must be—</p>
<p>ANA. You have, indeed, sirrah, and thus much more than you looked for.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>MEN. You shall not fight; but if you will always disagree, let us have
words and no blows. Heuresis, what reason have you to fall out with him?</p>
<p>HEU. Because he is always abusing me, and takes the upper hand of me
everywhere.</p>
<p>ANA. And why not, sirrah? I am thy better in any place.</p>
<p>HEU. Have I been the author of the seven liberal sciences, and
consequently of all learning, have I been the patron of all mechanical
devices, to be thy inferior? I tell thee, Anamnestes, thou hast not so
much as a point, but thou art beholding to me for it.</p>
<p>ANA. Good, good; but what had your invention been, but for my
remembrance? I can prove that thou, belly-sprung invention, art the most
improfitable member in the world; for ever since thou wert born, thou
hast been a bloody murderer; and thus I prove it: In the quiet years of
Saturn (I remember Jupiter was then but in his swathe-bands), thou
rentest the bowels of the earth, and broughtest gold to light, whose
beauty, like Helen, set all the world by the ears. Then, upon that, thou
foundest out iron, and puttest weapons in their hands, and now in the
last populous age thou taughtest a scabshin friar the hellish invention
of powder and guns.</p>
<p>HEU. Call'st it hellish? thou liest! It is the admirablest invention of
all others, for whereas others imitate nature, this excels nature
herself.</p>
<p>MEM. True; for a cannon will kill as many at one shot as thunder doth
commonly at twenty.</p>
<p>ANA. Therefore more murdering art thou than the light-bolt[278].</p>
<p>HEU. But to show the strength of my conceit, I have found out a means to
withstand the stroke of the most violent culverin. Mendacio, thou saw'st
it, when I demonstrated the invention.</p>
<p>ANA. What, some woolpacks or mud walls, or such like?</p>
<p>HEU. Mendacio, I prythee tell it him, for I love not to be a trumpeter
of mine own praises.</p>
<p>MEN. I must needs confess this device to pass all that ever I heard or
saw, and thus it was—first he takes a falcon, and charges it (without
all deceits) with dry powder well-camphired[279], then did he put in a
single bullet, and a great quantity of drop-shot both round and
lachrymal. This done, he sets me a boy sixty paces off, just point blank
over against the mouth of the piece. Now in the very midst of the direct
line he fastens a post, upon which he hangs me in a cord a siderite of
Herculean stone[280].</p>
<p>ANA. Well, well, I know it well, it was found out in Ida, in the year of
the world —— by one Magnes, whose name it retains, though vulgarly
they call it the Adamant.</p>
<p>MEN. When he had hanged this adamant in a cord, he comes back, and gives
fire to the touchhole: now the powder consumed to a void vacuum—</p>
<p>HEU. Which is intolerable in nature, for first shall the whole machine
of the world, heaven, earth, sea, and air, return to the misshapen house
of Chaos, than the least vacuum be found in the universe.</p>
<p>MEN. The bullet and drop-shot flew most impetuously from the fiery
throat of the culverin; but, O, strange, no sooner came they near the
adamant in the cord, but they were all arrested by the serjeant of
nature, and hovered in the air round about it, till they had lost the
force of their motion, clasping themselves close to the stone in most
lovely manner, and not any one flew to endanger the mark; so much did
they remember their duty to nature, that they forgot the errand they
were sent of.</p>
<p>ANA. This is a very artificial lie.</p>
<p>MEN. Nam, believe it, for I saw it, and which is more, I have practised
this device often. Once when I had a quarrel with one of my lady
Veritas' naked knaves, and had 'ppointed him the field, I conveyed into
the heart of my buckler an adamant, and when we met, I drew all the
foins of his rapier, whithersoever he intended them, or howsoever I
guided mine arm, pointed still to the midst of my buckler, so that by
this means I hurt the knave mortally, and myself came away untouched, to
the wonder of all the beholders.</p>
<p>ANA. Sirrah, you speak metaphorically, because thy wit, Mendacio, always
draws men's objections to thy forethought excuses.</p>
<p>HEU. Anamnestes, 'tis true, and I have an addition to this, which is to
make the bullet shot from the enemy to return immediately upon the
gunner. But let all these pass, and say the worst thou canst against me.</p>
<p>ANA. I say, guns were found out for the quick despatch of mortality; and
when thou sawest men grow wise, and beget so fair a child as Peace of so
foul and deformed a mother as War, lest there should be no murder, thou
devisedst poison.</p>
<p>MEN. Nay, fie, Nam, urge him not too far.</p>
<p>ANA. And last and worst, thou foundest out cookery, that kills more than
weapons, guns, wars, or poisons, and would destroy all, but that thou
invented'st physic, that helps to make away some.</p>
<p>HEU. But, sirrah, besides all this, I devised pillories for such forging
villains as thyself.</p>
<p>ANA. Call'st me villain?</p>
<p>                      [<emphasis>They fight, and are parted by</emphasis> MENDACIO.</p>
<p>MEN. You shall not fight as long as I am here. Give over, I say.</p>
<p>HEU. Mendacio, you offer me great wrong to hold me: in good faith,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall fall out with you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MEN. Away, away, away; you are Invention, are you not?</p>
<p>HEU. Yes, sir; what then?</p>

<p>MEN. Then I will be Judicium, the moderator betwixt you, and make you
both friends; come, come, shake hands, shake hands.</p>
<p>HEU. Well, well, if you will needs have it so.</p>

change of motherless rosewater; then take the best ladanum, benzoine,
both storaxes, ambergris, civet, and musk: incorporate them together,
and work them into what form you please. This, if your breath be not too

you should have made Thirst lead him by the hand.</p>

besides, I could not get red herrings and dried neats' tongues enough to
apparel him in.</p>

<p>GUS. Near to the lowly base of Cephalon,</p>

Yet arch'd above by wondrous workmanship,</p>

<p>

With hewen stones wrought smoother and more fine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than jet or marble fair from Iceland brought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Over the door directly doth incline</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A fair percullis of compacture strong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To shut out all that may annoy the state</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or health of Microcosm; and within</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is spread a long board like a pliant tongue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At which I hourly sit, and trial take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of meats and drinks needful and delectable:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Twice every day do I provision make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For the sumptuous kitchen of the commonwealth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which, once well-boil'd, is soon distributed</p>

To all the members, well refreshing them</p>

With good supply of strength-renewing food.</p>

Wherefore considering that, of all the things</p>

a nice gentlewoman; but there is such doing with their looking-glasses,
pinning, unpinning, setting, unsetting, formings and conformings;
painting blue veins and cheeks; such stir with sticks and combs,
cascanets, dressings, purls, falls, squares, busks, bodies, scarfs,
necklaces, carcanets, rebatoes, borders, tires, fans, palisadoes, puffs,
ruffs, cuffs, muffs, pusles, fusles, partlets, frislets, bandlets,
fillets, crosslets, pendulets, amulets, annulets, bracelets, and so many
lets, that yet she's scarce dressed to the girdle; and now there is such
calling for fardingales, kirtles, busk-points, shoe-ties, &amp;c., that
seven pedlars' shops—nay, all Stourbridge fair, will scarce furnish
her. A ship is sooner rigged by far, than a gentlewoman made ready.</p>

Will never change in changing their apparel.</p>

The blind man's candle, and his forehead's buckler,</p>

Through all the parts and climes of Microcosm.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

By sinews, that extend from head to foot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To every living part.</p>

<p>

For as a subtle spider, closely sitting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In centre of her web that spreadeth round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If the least fly but touch the smallest thread,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She feels it instantly; so doth myself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Casting my slender nerves and sundry nets</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er every particle of all the body,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By proper skill perceive the difference</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of several qualities, hot, cold, moist, and dry;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hard, soft, rough, smooth, clammy, and slippery:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet pleasure and sharp pain profitable,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That makes us (wounded) seek for remedy.</p>
<empty-line/>

By these means do I teach the body fly</p>

<p>

From such bad things as may endanger it.</p>
<empty-line/>

Unto a town than I to Microcosm.</p>

Tell me what Sense is not beholden to me?</p>

The nose is hot or cold, the eyes do weep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ears do feel, the taste's a kind of touching:</p>

And make them tremble, when I threaten them.</p>

<p>COM. SEN. Though you deserve no small punishment for these uproars, yet
at the request of these my assistants I remit it; and by the power of
judgment our gracious sovereign Psyche hath given me, thus I determine
of your controversies: hum! By your former objects, instruments and
reasons, I conceive the state of sense to be divided into two parts; one
of commodity, the other of necessity; both which are either for our
queen or for our country; but as the soul is more excellent than the
body, so are the Senses that profit the soul to be estimated before
those that are needful for the body. Visus and Auditus, serve
yourselves. Master Register, give me the crown; because it is better to
be well, than simply to be, therefore I judge the crown by right to
belong to you of the commodity's part, and the robe to you of the
necessity's side: and since you, Visus, are the author of invention, and
you, Auditus, of increase and addition to the same, seeing it is more
excellent to invent than to augment, I establish you, Visus, the better
of the two, and chief of all the rest: in token whereof I bestow upon
you this crown, to wear at your liberty.</p>
<p>VIS. I most humbly thank your lordships.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. But lest I should seem to neglect you, Auditus, I here choose
you to be the lord intelligencer to Psyche her majesty: and you,
Olfactus, we bestow upon you the chief priesthood of Microcosm,
perpetually to offer incense in her majesty's temple. As for you,
Tactus, upon your reasons alleged I bestow upon you the robe.</p>

the dear remembrance of your good lordship.</p>

great purveyor for all her dominions both by sea and land, in her realm

arbitrament.</p>

<p>LIN. I beseech your honour, let me speak; I will neither trouble the
company, nor offend your patience.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. I cannot stay so long; we have consulted about you, and find
your cause to stand upon these terms and conditions. The number of the
Senses in this world is answerable to the first[295] bodies in the great
world: now, since there be but fire in the universe, the four elements
and the pure substance of the heavens, therefore there can be but five
Senses in our Microcosm, correspondent to those; as the sight to the
heavens, hearing to the air, touching to the earth, smelling to the
fire, tasting to the water, by which five means only the understanding
is able to apprehend the knowledge of all corporeal substances:
wherefore we judge you to be no sense simply: only thus much we from
henceforth pronounce, that all women for your sake shall have six
senses—that is, seeing hearing, tasting, smelling, touching, and the
last and feminine sense, the sense of speaking.</p>

friendship) to grace my table with your most welcome presence this night

omit our daily attendance at the court, therefore I pray you pardon us.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

To bring thy foes together to a banquet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To lose thy crown, and be deluded thus!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, now I see my cause is desperate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The judgment's pass'd, sentence irrevocable,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Therefore I'll be content and clap my hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And give a plaudite to their proceedings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, shall I leave my hate begun unperfect?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So foully vanquish'd by the spiteful Senses!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall I, the embassadress of gods and men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That pull'd proud Phoebe from her brightsome sphere,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And dark'd Apollo's countenance with a word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Raising at pleasure storms, and winds, and earthquakes,</p>

Be overcrow'd, and breathe without revenge?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet they forsooth, base slaves, must be preferred,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And deck themselves with my right ornaments.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth the all-knowing Phoebus see this shame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without redress? will not the heavens help me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then shall hell do it; my enchanting tongue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can mount the skies, and in a moment fall</p>
<empty-line/>

From the pole arctic to dark Acheron.</p>

Told all the world of Midas' ass's ears.</p>

Pish, pish—madam—do you think me so foolish?—Tut, tut, doubt not.</p>

<p>MEN. My Lady Lingua is just like one of these lean-witted comedians
who, disturbing all to the fifth act, bring down some Mercury or Jupiter
in an engine to make all friends: so she, but in a contrary manner,
seeing her former plots dispurposed, sends me to an old witch called
Acrasia to help to wreak her spite upon the Senses. The old hag, after
many an encircled circumstance, and often naming of the direful Hecate
and Demogorgon. gives me this bottle of wine, mingled with such hellish
drugs and forcible words that, whosoever drinks of it shall be presently
possessed with an enraged and mad kind of anger.</p>

<p>CRA. You filthy long crane, you mean slave, will you kill your guests
with blowing continual hunger in them? The Senses have overcharged their
stomachs already, and you, sirrah, serve them up a fresh appetite with
every new dish. They had burst their guts if thou hadst stayed but a
thought longer. Begone, or I'll set thee away; begone, ye gnaw-bone,
raw-bone rascal![299]    [<emphasis>Beats him</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MEN. Then my device is clean spoiled. Appetitus should have been as the
bowl to present this medicine to the Senses, and now Crapula hath beaten
him out of doors; what shall I do?    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>CRA. Away, sirrah.    [<emphasis>Beats him</emphasis>.</p>
<p>APP. Well, Crapula, well; I have deserved better at your hands than so.
I was the man, you know, first brought you into Gustus's service. I
lined your guts there, and you use me thus? but grease a fat sow, &amp;c.</p>

of doors finely. Well, this is my comfort, I may walk now in liberty at
my own pleasure.</p>
<p>MEN. Appetitus, Appetitus!</p>
<p>APP. Ah, Mendacio, Mendacio!</p>
<p>MEN. Why, how now, man, how now? how is't? canst not speak?</p>
<p>APP. Faith, I am like a bagpipe, that never sounds but when the belly
is full.</p>
<p>MEN. Thou empty, and com'st from a feast?</p>
<p>APP. From a fray. I tell thee, Mendacio, I am now just like the ewe that
gave suck to a wolf's whelp; I have nursed up my fellow Crapula so long,
that he's grown strong enough to beat me.</p>
<p>MEN. And whither wilt thou go, now thou art banished out of service?</p>
<p>APP. Faith, I'll travel to some college or other in an university.</p>
<p>MEN. Why so?</p>
<p>APP. Because Appetitus is well-beloved amongst scholars, for there I can
dine and sup with them, and rise again as good friends as we sat down.
I'll thither, questionless.</p>
<p>MEN. Hear'st thou? give me thy hand. By this, I love thee: go to, then.</p>

<p>

Thou shalt not forsake thy masters thus, I say thou shalt not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>APP. Alas! I am very loth; but how should I help it?</p>
<p>MEN. Why, take this bottle of wine, come on; go thy ways to them again.</p>
<p>APP. Ha, ha, ha! what good will this do?</p>
<p>MEN. This is the Nepenthe that reconciles the gods. Do but let the
Senses taste of it, and fear not, they'll love thee as well as ever
they did.</p>
<p>APP. I pray thee, where hadst it?</p>
<p>MEN. My lady gave it me to bring her. Mercury stole it from Hebe for
her. Thou knowest there were some jars betwixt her and thy masters, and
with this drink she would gladly wash out all the relics of their
disagreement. Now, because I love thee, thou shalt have the grace of
presenting it to them, and so come in favour again.</p>
<p>APP. It smells well. I would fain begin to them.</p>
<p>MEN. Nay, stay no longer, lest they have supped before thou come.</p>
<p>APP. Mendacio, how shall I requite thy infinite courtesy?</p>
<p>MEN. Nay, pray thee leave, go catch occasion by the foretop. But hear'st
thou? As soon as it is presented, round[301] my Lady Lingua in the ear,

Answering so right my expectation.</p>

By this time Appetite is at the table,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with a lowly cringe presents the wine</p>

To his old master Gustus; now he takes it,</p>

<p>

And drinks, perchance, to Lingua; she craftily</p>

<p>

Kisses the cup, but lets not down a drop,</p>

And gives it to the rest: 'tis sweet, they'll swallow it:</p>

Wrath gives them weapons; pots and candlesticks,</p>

How now, Hunger? How dost thou, my fine maypole, ha?</p>
<p>APP. I may well be called a maypole, for the Senses do nothing but dance
a morrice about me.</p>

thee?</p>
<p>APP. Friends with me! nay, rather frenzy. I never knew them in such a
case in all my life.</p>
<p>MEN. Sure, they drank too much, and are mad for love of thee.</p>
<p>APP. They want Common Sense amongst them. There's such a hurlyburly.
Auditus is stark deaf, and wonders why men speak so softly that he
cannot hear them. Visus hath drunk himself stark blind, and therefore
imagineth himself to be Polyphemus. Tactus is raging mad, and cannot be

there! ah, ware counter![319]</p>
<p>VIS. Do you see the full moon yonder, and not the man in it? why,
methinks 'tis too-too evident: I see his dog very plain, and look you,
just under his tail is a thorn-bush of furze.</p>
<p>GUS. 'Twill make a fine toothpick, that lark's heel there: O, do not
burn it.</p>
<p>PHA. Boy Heuresis, what think'st thou I think, when I think nothing?</p>
<p>HEU. And it please you, sir, I think you are devising how to answer a
man that asks you nothing.</p>
<p>PHA. Well-guessed, boy; but yet thou mistook'st it, for I was thinking
of the constancy of women[320]. [APPETITUS <emphasis>snores aloud</emphasis>.] Beware,
sirrah, take heed; I doubt me there's some wild boar lodged hereabout.
How now? methinks these be the Senses; ha? in my conceit the elder
brother of death has kissed them.</p>
<p>TAC. O, O, O, I am stabbed, I am stabbed; hold your hand, O, O, O.</p>
<p>PHA. How now? do they talk in their sleep? are they not awake, Heuresis?</p>
<p>HEU. No, questionless, they be all fast asleep.</p>
<p>GUS. Eat not too many of those apples, they be very flative[321].</p>
<p>OLF. Foh, beat out this dog here; foh, was it you, Appetitus?</p>
<p>AUD. In faith, it was most sweetly-winded, whosoever it was; the warble
is very good, and the horn is excellent.</p>
<p>TAC. Put on, man, put on; keep your head warm, 'tis cold.</p>
<p>PHA. Ha, ha, ha, ha? 'st: Heuresis, stir not, sirrah.</p>
<p>APP. Shut the door, the pot runs over, sirrah. Cook, that will be a
sweet pasty, if you nibble the venison so.</p>
<p>GUS. Say you so? is a marrow-pie the Helena of meats? give me't; if I
play not Paris, hang me. Boy, a clean trencher.</p>
<p>APP. Serve up, serve up; this is a fat rabbit, would I might have the
maidenhead of it: come, give me the fish there; who hath meddled with
these maids, ha?</p>
<p>OLF. Fie, shut your snuffers closer for shame; 'tis the worst smell that
can be.</p>
<p>TAC. O, the cramp, the cramp, the cramp: my leg, my leg!</p>
<p>LIN. I must abroad presently: reach me my best necklace presently.</p>
<p>PHA. Ah, Lingua, are you there?</p>
<p>AUD. Here take this rope, and I'll help the leader close with the second
bell. Fie, fie, there's a goodly peal clean-spoiled.</p>
<p>VIS. I'll lay my life that gentlewoman is painted: well, well, I know
it; mark but her nose: do you not see the complexion crack out? I must
confess 'tis a good picture.</p>
<p>TAC. Ha, ha, ha! fie, I pray you leave, you tickle me so: oh, ha, ha,
ha! take away your hands, I cannot endure; ah, you tickle me, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>VIS. Hai, Rett, Rett, Rett, now, bird, now,—look about that bush, she
trussed her thereabout.—Here she is, ware wing, Cater,[322] ware wing,
avaunt.</p>
<p>LIN. Mum, mum, mum, mum.</p>
<p>PHA. Hist, sirrah, take heed you wake her not.</p>
<p>HEU. I know, sir, she is fast asleep, for her mouth is shut.</p>
<p>LIN. This 'tis to venture upon such uncertainties; to lose so rich a
crown to no end, well, well.</p>
<p>PHA. Ha, ha, ha! we shall hear anon where she lost her maidenhead: 'st,
boy, my Lord Vicegerent and Master Register are hard by: run quickly;
tell them of this accident, wish them come softly.</p>
<p>                                                      [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> HEURESIS.</p>
<p>LIN. Mendacio, never talk farther, I doubt 'tis past recovery, and my
robe likewise: I shall never have them again. Well, well.</p>
<p>PHA. How? her crown and her robe, never recover them? hum, was it not
said to be left by Mercury, ha? I conjecture here's some knavery,—fast
locked with sleep, in good faith. Was that crown and garment yours,
Lingua?</p>
<p>LIN. Ay, marry were they, and that somebody hath felt, and shall feel
more, if I live.</p>
<p>PHA. O, strange, she answers in her sleep to my question: but how come
the Senses to strive for it?</p>
<p>LIN. Why, I laid it on purpose in their way, that they might fall
together by the ears.</p>
<p>PHA. What a strange thing is this!</p>

<p>    <emphasis>The Senses</emphasis>, APPETITUS, <emphasis>and</emphasis> LINGUA, <emphasis>asleep</emphasis>.
    PHANTASTES, COMMUNIS SENSUS, MEMORIA, ANAMNESTES.</p>
<p>PHA. Hist, my lord: softly, softly! here's the notablest piece of
treason discovered; how say you? Lingua set all the Senses at odds, she
hath confessed it to me in her sleep.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Is't possible, Master Register? did you ever know any talk in
their sleep.</p>
<p>MEM. I remember, my lord, many have done so very oft; but women are
troubled especially with this talking disease; many of them have I heard
answer in their dreams, and tell what they did all day awake.</p>
<p>ANA. By the same token, there was a wanton maid, that being asked by her
mother what such a one did with her so late one night in such a room,
she presently said that—</p>
<p>MEM. Peace, you vile rake-hell, is such a jest fit for this company? no
more, I say, sirrah.</p>
<p>PHA. My lord, will you believe your own ears? you shall hear her answer
me as directly and truly as may be. Lingua, what did you with the crown
and garments?</p>
<p>LIN. I'll tell thee, Mendacio.</p>
<p>PHA. She thinks Mendacio speaks to her; mark now, mark how truly she
will answer. What say you, madam?</p>
<p>LIN. I say Phantastes is a foolish, transparent gull; a mere fanatic
napson[323], in my imagination not worthy to sit as a judge's assistant.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Ha, ha, ha! how truly and directly she answers.</p>
<p>PHA. Faw, faw, she dreams now; she knows not what she says. I'll try her
once again. Madam, what remedy can you have for your great losses?</p>
<p>LIN. O, are you come, Acrasia? welcome, welcome! boy, reach a cushion,
sit down, good Acrasia: I am so beholding to you, your potion wrought
exceedingly; the Senses were so mad: did not you see how they raged
about the woods?</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Hum, Acrasia? is Acrasia her confederate? my life, that witch
hath wrought some villainy. [LINGUA <emphasis>riseth in her sleep, and walketh</emphasis>.]
How is this? is she asleep? have you seen one walk thus before?</p>
<p>MEM. It is a very common thing; I have seen many sick of the peripatetic
disease.</p>
<p>ANA. By the same token, my lord, I knew one that went abroad in his
sleep, bent his bow, shot at a magpie, killed her, fetched his arrow,
came home, locked the doors, and went to bed again.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. What should be the reason of it?</p>
<p>MEM. I remember Scaliger told me the reason once, as I think thus: the
nerves that carry the moving faculty from the brains to the thighs,
legs, feet, and arms, are wider far than the other nerves; wherefore
they are not so easily stopped with the vapours of sleep, but are night
and day ready to perform what fancy shall command them.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. It may be so. But, Phantastes, inquire more of Acrasia.</p>
<p>PHA. What did you with the potion Acrasia made you?</p>
<p>LIN. Gave it to the Senses, and made them as mad as—well, if I cannot
recover it—let it go. I'll not leave them thus.
                                               [<emphasis>She lies down again</emphasis>.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Boy, awake the Senses there.</p>
<p>ANA. Ho, ho, Auditus, up, up; so ho, Olfactus, have at your nose; up,
Visus, Gustus, Tactus, up: what, can you not feel a pinch? have at you
with a pin.</p>
<p>TAC. O, you stab me, O!</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Tactus, know you how you came hither?</p>
<p>TAC. No, my lord, not I; this I remember,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We supp'd with Gustus, and had wine good store,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whereof I think I tasted liberally.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Amongst the rest, we drunk a composition</p>

<p>HEU. My lord, here's a fat rascal was lurking in a bush very
suspiciously: his name, he says, is Crapula.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Sirrah, speak quickly what you know of these troubles.</p>
<p>CRA. Nothing, my lord, but that the Senses were mad, and that Somnus, at
my request, laid them asleep, in hope to recover them.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Why then, 'tis too evident Acrasia, at Lingua's request,
bewitched the Senses: wake her quickly, Heuresis.</p>
<p>LIN. Heigho, out alas, ah me, where am I? how came I here?
where am I? ah!</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Lingua, look not so strangely upon the matter; you have
confessed in your sleep, that with a crown and a robe you have disturbed
the Senses, using a crafty help to enrage them: can you deny it?</p>
<p>LIN. Ah me, most miserable wretch! I beseech your lordship forgive me.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. No, no, 'tis a fault unpardonable.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                           [<emphasis>He consults with</emphasis> MEMORY.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PHA. In my conceit, Lingua, you should seal up your lips when you go to
bed, these feminine tongues be so glib.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Visus, Tactus, and the rest, our former sentence concerning
you we confirm as irrevocable, and establish the crown to you, Visus,
and the robe to you, Tactus; but as for you, Lingua—</p>
<p>LIN. Let me have mine own, howsoever you determine, I beseech you.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. That may not be: your goods are fallen into our hands; my
sentence cannot be recalled: you may see, those that seek what is not
theirs, oftentimes lose what's their own: therefore, Lingua, granting
you your life, I commit you to close prison in Gustus's house, and
charge you, Gustus, to keep her under the custody of two strong doors,
and every day, till she come to eighty years of age, see she be
well-guarded with thirty tall watchmen, without whose licence she shall
by no means wag abroad. Nevertheless, use her ladylike, according to her
estate.</p>
<p>PHA. I pray you, my lord, add this to the judgment—that, whensoever
she obtaineth licence to walk abroad, in token the tongue was the cause
of her offence, let her wear a velvet hood, made just in the fashion of
a great tongue. In my conceit, 'tis a very pretty emblem of a woman.</p>
<p>TAC. My lord, she hath a wild boy to her page, a chief agent in this
treason: his name's Mendacio.</p>
<p>COM. SEN. Ha! well, I will inflict this punishment on him for this time:
let him be soundly whipped, and ever after, though he shall strengthen
his speeches with the sinews of truth, yet none shall believe him.</p>
<p>PHA. In my imagination, my lord, the day is dead to the great toe, and
in my conceit it grows dark, by which I conjecture it will be cold; and
therefore, in my fancy and opinion, 'tis best to repair to our lodgings.</p>

<p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>George Wilkins, like many other minor poets of his time, has had no
memorials concerning him transmitted to us. He wrote no play alone,
except that which is here reprinted; but he joined with John Day and
William Rowley in "The Travels of the Three English Brothers, Sir
Thomas, Sir Anthony, and Sir Robert Shirley," an historical play,
printed in 4to, 1607[325]. He was also the author of "Three Miseries
of Barbary: Plague, Famine, Civill warre." [1603.] 4to. B.L.[326]</p>
<p>[There was a second writer of both these names, probably a son,
who published in 1608 a prose novel, founded on the play of
"Pericles."[327]]</p>

<p>BAR. But Frank, Frank, now we are come to the house, what shall we make
to be our business?</p>
<p>ILF. Tut, let us be impudent enough, and good enough.</p>
<p>WEN. We have no acquaintance here, but young Scarborow.</p>
<p>ILF. How no acquaintance? Angels guard me from thy company. I tell thee,
Wentloe, thou art not worthy to wear gilt spurs[330], clean linen, nor
good clothes.</p>
<p>WEN. Why, for God's sake?</p>
<p>ILF. By this hand, thou art not a man fit to table at an ordinary, keep
knights company to bawdy-houses, nor beggar thy tailor.</p>
<p>WEN. Why, then, I am free from cheaters, clear from the pox, and escape
curses.</p>
<p>ILF. Why, dost thou think there is any Christians in the world?</p>
<p>WEN. Ay, and Jews too, brokers, puritans, and sergeants.</p>
<p>ILF. Or dost thou mean to beg after charity, that goes in a cold suit
already, that thou talkest thou hast no acquaintance here? I tell thee,
Wentloe, thou canst not live on this side of the world, feed well, drink
tobacco[331], and be honoured into the presence, but thou must be
acquainted with all sorts of men; ay, and so far in too, till they
desire to be more acquainted with thee.</p>
<p>BAR. True, and then you shall be accounted a gallant of good credit.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CLOWN.</p>
<p>ILF. But stay, here is a scrape-trencher arrived:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How now, blue-bottle,[332] are you of the house?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLOWN. I have heard of many black-jacks, sir, but never of a
blue-bottle.</p>
<p>ILF. Well, sir, are you of the house?</p>
<p>CLOWN. No, sir, I am twenty yards without, and the house stands
without me.</p>
<p>BAR. Prythee, tell's who owes[333] this building?</p>
<p>CLOWN. He that dwells in it, sir.</p>
<p>ILF. Who dwells in it, then?</p>
<p>CLOWN. He that owes it.</p>
<p>ILF. What's his name?</p>
<p>CLOWN. I was none of his god-father.</p>
<p>ILF. Does Master Scarborow lie here?</p>
<p>CLOWN. I'll give you a rhyme for that, sir—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sick men may lie, and dead men in their graves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Few else do lie abed at noon, but drunkards, punks, and knaves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. What am I the better for thy answer?</p>
<p>CLOWN. What am I the better for thy question?</p>
<p>ILF. Why, nothing.</p>
<p>CLOWN. Why, then, of nothing comes nothing.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SCARBOROW.</p>
<p>WEN. 'Sblood, this is a philosophical fool.</p>
<p>CLOWN. Then I, that am a fool by art, am better than you, that are fools
by nature.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>SCAR. Gentlemen, welcome to Yorkshire.</p>
<p>ILF. And well-encountered, my little villain of fifteen hundred a year.
'Sfoot, what makest thou here in this barren soil of the North, when
thy honest friends miss thee at London?</p>
<p>SCAR. Faith, gallants, 'tis the country where my father lived, where
first I saw the light, and where I am loved.</p>
<p>ILF. Loved! ay, as courtiers love usurers, and that is just as long as
they lend them money. Now, dare I lay—</p>
<p>WEN. None of your land, good knight, for that is laid to mortgage
already.</p>
<p>ILF. I dare lay with any man, that will take me up.</p>
<p>WEN. <emphasis>Who list to have a lubberly load</emphasis>.    [<emphasis>Sings this</emphasis>.[334]</p>
<p>ILF. Sirrah wag, this rogue was son and heir to Antony Now-now[335] and
Blind Moon. And he must needs be a scurvy musician, that hath two
fiddlers to his fathers: but tell me, in faith, art thou not—nay, I
know thou art, called down into the country here by some hoary knight or
other who, knowing thee a young gentleman of good parts and a great
living, hath desired thee to see some pitiful piece of his workmanship
—a daughter, I mean. Is't not so?</p>
<p>SCAR. About some such preferment I came down.</p>
<p>ILF. Preferment's a good word. And when do you commence into the
cuckold's order—the preferment you speak of? when shall we have
gloves;[336] when, when?</p>
<p>SCAR. Faith, gallants, I have been guest here but since last night.</p>
<p>ILF. Why, and that is time enough to make up a dozen marriages, as
marriages are made up nowadays. For look you, sir; the father, according
to the fashion, being sure you have a good living, and without
encumbrance, comes to you thus:—takes you by the hand thus:—wipes his
long beard thus:—or turns up his moustachio thus:—walks some turn or
two thus:—to show his comely gravity thus:—and having washed his foul
mouth thus: at last breaks out thus.——</p>
<p>WEN. O God! let us hear no more of this?</p>
<p>ILF.——Master Scarborow, you are a young gentleman; I knew your
father well, he was my worshipful good neighbour, for our demesnes lay
near together. Then, sir, you and I must be of more near acquaintance,
at which you must make an eruption thus:—O God (sweet sir)—</p>
<p>BAR. 'Sfoot, the knight would have made an excellent Zany in an Italian
comedy.</p>
<p>ILF. When he goes forward thus: Sir, myself am lord of some thousand a
year, a widower (Master Scarborow). I have a couple of young gentlewomen
to my daughters: a thousand a year will do well divided among them; ha,
will't not, Master Scarborow? At which you out of your education must
reply thus: The portion will deserve them worthy husbands: on which
tinder he soon takes fire, and swears you are the man his hopes shot at,
and one of them shall be yours.</p>
<p>WEN. If I did not like her, should he swear himself[337] to the devil, I
would make him foresworn.</p>
<p>ILF. Then putting you and the young pug[338] too in a close room
together——</p>
<p>WEN. If he should lie with her there, is not the father partly the bawd?</p>
<p>ILF.——Where the young puppet, having the lesson before from the old
fox, gives the son half a dozen warm kisses which, after her father's
oaths, takes such impression in thee, thou straight call'st, By Jesu,
mistress, I love you!—when she has the wit to ask, But, sir, will you
marry me? and thou, in thy cock-sparrow humour, repliest, Ay, before
God, as I am a gentleman, will I; which the father overhearing, leaps
in, takes you at your word, swears he is glad to see this; nay, he will
have you contracted straight, and for a need makes the priest of
himself.
Thus in one hour, from a quiet life,
Thou art sworn in debt, and troubled with a wife.</p>
<p>BAR. But can they love one another so soon?</p>
<p>ILF. O, it is no matter nowadays for love; 'tis well, and they can but
make shift to lie together.</p>
<p>WEN. But will your father do this too, if he know the gallant breathes
himself at some two or three bawdy-houses in a morning?</p>
<p>ILF. O, the sooner; for that and the land together tell the old lad, he
will know the better how to deal with his daughter.
The wise and ancient fathers know this rule,
Should both wed maids, the child would be a fool.
Come, wag, if thou hast gone no further than into the ordinary fashion—
meet, see, and kiss—give over; marry not a wife, to have a hundred
plagues for one pleasure: let's to London, there's variety: and change
of pasture makes fat calves.</p>
<p>SCAR. But change of women bald knaves, sir knight.</p>
<p>ILF. Wag, and thou beest a lover but three days, thou wilt be heartless,
sleepless, witless, mad, wretched, miserable, and indeed a stark fool;
and by that thou hast been married but three weeks, though thou shouldst
wed a <emphasis>Cynthia rara avis</emphasis>, thou wouldst be a man monstrous—a cuckold,
a cuckold.</p>
<p>BAR. And why is a cuckold monstrous, knight?</p>
<p>ILF. Why, because a man is made a beast by being married. Take but
example thyself from the moon: as soon as she is delivered of her great
belly, doth she not point at the world with a pair of horns, as who
would say: Married men, ye are cuckolds.</p>
<p>SCAR. I construe more divinely of their sex:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Being maids, methinks they are angels; and being wives,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They are sovereign cordials that preserve our lives,[339]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They are like our hands that feed us; this is clear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They renew man, as spring renews the year.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. There's ne'er a wanton wench that hears thee, but thinks thee a
coxcomb for saying so: marry none of them; if thou wilt have their true
characters, I'll give it thee. Women are the purgatory of men's purses,
the paradise of their bodies, and the hell of their minds; marry none of
them. Women[340] are in churches saints, abroad angels, at home devils.
Here are married men enough know this: marry none of them.</p>
<p>SCAR. Men that traduce by custom, show sharp wit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Only in speaking ill; and practice it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against the best creatures, divine women,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who are God's agents' here, and the heavenly eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By which this orb hath her maturity:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beauty in women gets the world with child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without whom she were barren, faint and wild.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They are the stems on which do angels grow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From whence virtue is still'd, and arts do flow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SIR JOHN HARCOP <emphasis>and his daughter</emphasis> CLARE.</p>
<p>ILF. Let them be what flowers they will; and they were roses, I will
pluck none of them for pricking my fingers. But soft, here comes a
voider for us: and I see, do what I can, as long as the world lasts,
there will be cuckolds in it. Do you hear, child, here's one come to
blend you together: he has brought you a kneading-tub, if thou dost
take her at his hands.
Though thou hadst Argus' eyes, be sure of this,
Women have sworn with more than one to kiss.</p>
<p>HAR. Nay, no parting, gentlemen. Hem!</p>
<p>WEN. 'Sfoot, does he make punks of us, that he hems already?</p>
<p>HAR. Gallants,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Know old John Harcop keeps a wine-cellar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Has travell'd, been at court, known fashions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And unto all bear habit like yourselves—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The shapes of gentlemen and men of sort,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have a health to give them, ere they part.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WEN. Health, knight! not as drunkards give their healths, I hope: to go
together by the ears when they have done?</p>
<p>HAR. My healths are Welcome: Welcome, gentlemen.</p>
<p>ILF. Are we welcome, knight, in faith?</p>
<p>HAR. Welcome, in faith, sir.</p>
<p>ILF. Prythee, tell me, hast not thou been a whoremaster?</p>
<p>HAR. In youth I swill'd my fill at Venus' cup,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Instead of full draughts now I am fain to sup.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. Why then thou art a man fit for my company:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dost thou hear? (<emphasis>to</emphasis> WEN. <emphasis>and</emphasis> BAR.) he is a good fellow of our stamp.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make much of this[341] father.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                  [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Manent</emphasis> SCARBOROW <emphasis>and</emphasis> CLARE.</p>
<p>SCAR. The father and the gallants have left me here with a gentlewoman,
and if I know what to say to her, I am a villain. Heaven grant her life
hath borrowed so much impudence of her sex but to speak to me first:
for, by this hand, I have not so much steel of immodesty in my face to
parley to a wench without blushing. I'll walk by her, in hope she can
open her teeth. Not a word? Is it not strange a man should be in a
woman's company all this while and not hear her tongue. I'll go
further. God of his goodness! not a syllable. I think if I should take
up her clothes too, she would say nothing to me. With what words, trow,
does a man begin to woo. Gentlewoman, pray you, what is't a clock?</p>
<p>CLARE. Troth, sir, carrying no watch about me but mine eyes, I answer
you: I cannot tell.</p>
<p>SCAR. And if you cannot tell, beauty, I take the adage for my reply: you
are naught to keep sheep.</p>
<p>CLARE. Yet I am big enough to keep myself.</p>
<p>SCAR. Prythee tell me: are you not a woman?</p>
<p>CLARE. I know not that neither, till I am better acquainted with a man.</p>
<p>SCAR. And how would you be acquainted with a man?</p>
<p>CLARE. To distinguish betwixt himself and myself.</p>
<p>SCAR. Why, I am a man?</p>
<p>CLARE. That's more than I know, sir.</p>
<p>SCAR. To approve I am no less, thus I kiss thee.</p>
<p>CLARE. And by that proof I am a man too; for I have kissed you.</p>
<p>SCAR. Prythee, tell me, can you love?</p>
<p>CLARE. O Lord, sir, three or four things: I love my meat, choice of
suitors, clothes in the fashion, and, like a right woman, I love to have
my will.</p>
<p>SCAR. What think you of me for a husband?</p>
<p>CLARE. Let me first know what you think of me for a wife?</p>
<p>SCAR. Troth, I think you are a proper gentlewoman.</p>
<p>CLARE. Do you but think so?</p>
<p>SCAR. Nay, I see you are a very perfect proper gentlewoman.</p>
<p>CLARE. It is great pity then I should be alone without a proper man.</p>
<p>SCAR. Your father says I shall marry you.</p>
<p>CLARE. And I say, God forbid, sir! alas, I am a great deal too young.</p>
<p>SCAR. I love thee, by my troth.</p>
<p>CLARE. O, pray you do not so; for then you stray from the steps of
gentility; the fashion among them is to marry first, and love after by
leisure.</p>
<p>SCAR. That I do love thee, here by heaven I swear, And call it as a
witness to this kiss.</p>
<p>CLARE. You will not enforce me, I hope, sir?</p>
<p>SCAR. Make me this woman's husband! thou art my Clare:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Accept my heart, and prove as chaste as fair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLARE. O God! you are too hot in your gifts; should I accept them, we
should have you plead nonage some half a year hence, sue for
reversement, and say the deed was done under age.</p>
<p>SCAR. Prythee, do not jest.</p>
<p>CLARE. No (God is my record), I speak in earnest: and desire to know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whether ye mean to marry me, yea or no?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. This hand thus takes thee as my loving wife.</p>
<p>CLARE. For better, for worse.</p>
<p>SCAR. Ay, till death us depart,[342] love.</p>
<p>CLARE. Why, then, I thank you, sir, and now I am like to have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I long look'd for—a husband.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How soon from our own tongues is the word said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Captives our maiden-freedom to a head!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Clare, you are now mine, and I must let you know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What every wife doth to her husband owe:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be a wife, is to be dedicate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not to a youthful course, wild and unsteady,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But to the soul of virtue, obedience,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Studying to please, and never to offend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wives have two eyes created, not like birds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To roam about at pleasure, but for[343] sentinels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To watch their husbands' safety as their own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two hands; one's to feed him, the other herself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two feet, and one of them is their husbands'.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They have two of everything, only of one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their chastity, that should be his alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their very thoughts they cannot term their own.[344]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Maids, being once made wives, can nothing call</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rightly their own; they are their husbands' all:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If such a wife you can prepare to be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Clare, I am yours: and you are fit for me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLARE. We being thus subdued, pray you know then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As women owe a duty, so do men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Men must be like the branch and bark to trees,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which doth defend them from tempestuous rage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Clothe them in winter, tender them in age:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or as ewes love unto their eanlings gives,[345]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such should be husbands' custom to their wives.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If it appear to them they've stray'd amiss,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They only must rebuke them with a kiss;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or clock them, as hens chickens, with kind call,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cover them under wing, and pardon all:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No jars must make two beds, no strife divide them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those betwixt whom a faith and troth is given,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Death only parts, since they are knit by heaven:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If such a husband you intend to be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am your Clare, and you are fit for me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. By heaven—</p>
<p>CLARE. Advise, before you swear, let me remember you,[346]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Men never give their faith and promise marriage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But heaven records their oath: if they prove true,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heaven smiles for joy; if not, it weeps for you:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unless your heart, then, with your words agree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet let us part, and let us both be free.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. If ever man, in swearing love, swore true,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My words are like to his. Here comes your father.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    _Enter SIR JOHN HARCOP, ILFORD, WENTLOE, BARTLEY, <emphasis>and Butler</emphasis>.</p>
<p>HAR. Now, Master Scarborrow.</p>
<p>SCAR. Prepar'd to ask, how you like that we have done:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your daughter's made my wife, and I your son.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>HAR. And both agreed so?</p>
<p>BOTH. We are, sir.</p>
<p>HAR. Then long may you live together, have store of sons!</p>
<p>ILF. 'Tis no matter who is the father.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>HAR. But, son, here is a man of yours is come from London.</p>
<p>BUT. And brought you letters, sir.</p>
<p>SCAR. What news from London, butler?</p>
<p>BUT. The old news, sir. The ordinaries are full of cheaters, some
citizens are bankrupts, and many gentlemen beggars.</p>
<p>SCAR. Clare, here is an unwelcome pursuivant;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My lord and guardian writes to me, with speed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I must return to London.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>HAR. And you being ward to him, son Scarborow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And no ingrate,[347] it fits that you obey him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR.[348] It does, it does; for by an ancient law</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We are born free heirs, but kept like slaves in awe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who are for London, gallants?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. Switch and Spur, we will bear you company.</p>
<p>SCAR. Clare, I must leave thee—with what unwillingness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Witness this dwelling kiss upon thy lip;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And though I must be absent from thine eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be sure my heart doth in thy bosom lie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Three years I am yet a ward, which time I'll pass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Making thy faith my constant looking-glass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till when—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLARE. Till when you please, where'er you live or lie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your love's here worn: you're present[349] in my eye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> LORD FALCONBRIDGE <emphasis>and</emphasis> SIR WILLIAM SCARBOROW.</p>
<p>LORD. Sir William,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How old, say you, is your kinsman Scarborow?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. Eighteen, my lord, next Pentecost.</p>
<p>LORD. Bethink you, good Sir William,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I reckon thereabout myself; so by that account</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There's full three winters yet he must attend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Under our awe, before he sue his livery:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is it not so?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. Not a day less, my lord.</p>
<p>LORD. Sir William, you are his uncle, and I must speak,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That am his guardian; would I had a son</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Might merit commendations equal[350] with him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll tell you what he is: he is a youth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A noble branch, increasing blessed fruit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where caterpillar vice dare not to touch:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He bears[351] himself with so much gravity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Praise cannot praise him with hyperbole:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is one, whom older look upon as on a book:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wherein are printed noble sentences</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For them to rule their lives by. Indeed he is one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All emulate his virtues, hate him none.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. His friends are proud to hear this good of him.</p>
<p>LORD. And yet, Sir William, being as he is,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Young and unsettled, though of virtuous thoughts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By genuine disposition, yet our eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See daily precedents, [how] hopeful gentlemen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Being trusted in the world with their own will,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Divert the good is look'd from them to ill;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make their old names forgot, or not worth note:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With company they keep such revelling,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With panders, parasites, prodigies of knaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That they sell all, even their old fathers' graves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which to prevent we'll match him to a wife:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marriage restrains the scope of single life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. My lord speaks like a father for my kinsman.</p>
<p>LORD. And I have found him one of noble parentage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A niece of mine; nay, I have broke with her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Know thus much of her mind, that[352] for my pleasure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As also for the good appears in him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She is pleased of all that's hers to make him king.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. Our name is bless'd in such an honoured marriage.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> DOCTOR BAXTER.</p>
<p>LORD. Also I have appointed Doctor Baxter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Chancellor of Oxford, to attend me here:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see, he is come. Good Master Doctor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BAX. My honourable lord.</p>
<p>WIL. I have possess'd you[353] with this business, Master Doctor.</p>
<p>BAX. To see the contract 'twixt your honoured niece</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Master Scarborow?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LORD. 'Tis so, and I did look for him by this.</p>
<p>BAX. I saw him leave his horse, as I came up.</p>
<p>LORD. So, so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then he will be here forthwith: you, Master Baxter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Go usher hither straight young Katherine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir William here and I will keep this room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till you return.</p>

<p>SCAR. Kind uncle.</p>
<p>WIL. Thanks, my good coz.</p>
<p>LORD. You have been welcome in your country Yorkshire?</p>
<p>SCAR. The time that I spent there, my lord, was merry.</p>
<p>LORD. 'Twas well, 'twas very well! and in your absence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your uncle here and I have been bethinking,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What gift 'twixt us we might bestow on you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That to your house large dignity might bring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fair increase, as from a crystal spring.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> DOCTOR <emphasis>and</emphasis> KATHERINE.</p>
<p>SCAR. My name is bound to your benificence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your hands have been to me like bounty's purse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Never shut up, yourself my foster nurse:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nothing can from your honour come, prove me so rude,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I'll accept, to shun ingratitude.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LORD. We accept thy promise, now return thee this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A virtuous wife: accept her with a kiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. My honourable lord!</p>
<p>LORD. Fear not to take her, man: she will fear neither,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do what thou canst, being both abed together.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. O, but my lord—</p>
<p>LORD. But me? dog of wax! come kiss, and agree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your friends have thought it fit, and it must be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. I have no hands to take her to my wife.</p>
<p>LORD. How, sauce-box?</p>
<p>SCAR. O, pardon me, my lord; the unripeness of my years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too green for government, is old in fears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To undertake that charge.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LORD. Sir, sir, and sir knave, then here is a mellowed experience knows
how to teach you.</p>
<p>SCAR. O God.</p>
<p>LORD. O Jack,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have[355] both our cares, your uncle and myself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sought, studied, found out, and for your good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A maid, a niece of mine, both fair and chaste;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And must we stand at your discretion?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. O good my lord,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had I two souls, then might I have two wives:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had I two faiths, then had I one for her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Having of both but one, that one is given</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Sir John Harcop's daughter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LORD. Ha, ha! what's that? let me hear that again.</p>
<p>SCAR. To Sir John Harcop's Clare I have made an oath:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Part me in twain, yet she's one-half of both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This hand the which I wear, it is half hers:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such power hath faith and troth 'twixt couples young,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Death only cuts that knot tied with the tongue.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LORD. And have you knit that knot, sir?</p>
<p>SCAR. I have done so much that, if I wed not her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My marriage makes me an adulterer:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In which black sheets I wallow all my life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My babes being bastards, and a whore my wife.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Write me a letter straight to Sir John Harcop,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll see, sir Jack, and if that Harcop dare,</p>
<empty-line/>

Being my ward, contract you to his daughter.</p>

Sir, you shall know that you are ward to me,</p>

I'll make you poor enough: then mend yourself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. O cousin!</p>
<p>SCAR. O uncle!</p>
<p>LORD. Contract yourself, and where you list?</p>
<empty-line/>

I'll make you know me, sir, to be your guard.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Four thousand pounds, upon this marriage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Surrendered up your land to your own use,</p>

And compass'd other portions to your hands,</p>

Sir, I'll now yoke you still.</p>

I'll make thee marry to my chambermaid. Come, coz.

<p>SCAR. O, but, good uncle, could I command my love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or cancel oaths out of heaven's brazen book,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Engross'd by God's own finger, then you might speak.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had men that law to love, as most have tongues</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To love a thousand women with, then you might speak.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were love like dust, lawful for every wind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bear from place to place; were oaths but puffs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Men might forswear themselves; but I do know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though, sin being pass'd with us, the act's forgot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The poor soul groans, and she forgets it not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. Yet hear your own case.</p>
<p>SCAR. O, 'tis too miserable!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I, a gentleman, should be thus torn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From mine own right, and forc'd to be forsworn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WIL. Yet, being as it is, it must be your care,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To salve it with advice, not with despair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are his ward: being so, the law intends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is to have your duty, and in his rule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is both your marriage and your heritage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you rebel 'gainst these injunctions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The penalty takes hold on you; which for himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He straight thus prosecutes; he wastes your land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Weds you where he thinks fit:[357] but if yourself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have of some violent humour match'd yourself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without his knowledge, then hath he power</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To merce[358] your purse, and in a sum so great,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That shall for ever keep your fortunes weak,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where otherwise, if you be rul'd by him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your house is rais'd by matching to his kin.</p>

<p>LORD. Now, death of me, shall I be cross'd</p>

By such a jack? he wed himself, and where he list:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sirrah malapert, I'll hamper you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You that will have your will, come, get you in:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll make thee shape thy thoughts to marry her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or wish thy birth had been thy murderer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Fate, pity me, because I am enforc'd:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I have heard those matches have cost blood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where love is once begun, and then withstood.</p>

<p><strong>ACT II.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> ILFORD, <emphasis>and a</emphasis> PAGE <emphasis>with him</emphasis>.</p>
<p>ILF. Boy, hast thou delivered my letter?</p>
<p>BOY. Ay, sir, I saw him open the lips on't.</p>
<p>ILF. He had not a new suit on, had he?</p>
<p>BOY. I am not so well acquainted with his wardrobe, sir; but I saw a
lean fellow, with sunk eyes and shamble legs, sigh pitifully at his
chamber door, and entreat his man to put his master in mind of him.</p>
<p>ILF. O, that was his tailor. I see now he will be blessed, he profits by
my counsel: he will pay no debts, before he be arrested—nor then
neither, if he can find e'er a beast that dare but be bail for him; but
he will seal[359] i' th' afternoon?</p>
<p>BOY. Yes, sir, he will imprint for you as deep as he can.</p>
<p>ILF. Good, good, now have I a parson's nose, and smell tithe coming in
then. Now let me number how many rooks I have half-undone already this
term by the first return: four by dice, six by being bound with me, and
ten by queans: of which some be courtiers, some country gentlemen, and
some citizens' sons. Thou art a good Frank; if thou purgest[360] thus,
thou art still a companion for gallants, may'st keep a catamite, take
physic at the spring and the fall.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> WENTLOE.</p>
<p>WEN. Frank, news that will make thee fat, Frank.</p>
<p>ILF. Prythee, rather give me somewhat will keep me lean; I have no mind
yet to take physic.</p>
<p>WEN. Master Scarborow is married, man.</p>
<p>ILF. Then heaven grant he may (as few married men do) make much of his
wife.</p>
<p>WEN. Why? wouldst have him love her, let her command all, and make her
his master?</p>
<p>ILF. No, no; they that do so, make not much of their wives, but give
them their will, and its the marring of them.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> BARTLEY.</p>
<p>BAR. Honest Frank, valorous Frank, a portion of thy wit, but to help us
in this enterprise, and we may walk London streets, and cry <emphasis>pish</emphasis> at
the serjeants.</p>
<p>ILF. You may shift out one term, and yet die in the Counter. These are
the scabs now that hang upon honest Job. I am Job, and these are the
scurvy scabs [<emphasis>aside</emphasis>]; but what's this your pot seethes over withal?</p>
<p>BAR. Master Scarborough is married, man.</p>
<p>WEN. He has all his land in his own hand.</p>
<p>BAR. His brother's and sister's portions.</p>
<p>WEN. Besides four thousand pounds in ready money with his wife.</p>
<p>ILF. A good talent,[361] by my faith; it might help many gentlemen to
pay their tailors, and I might be one of them.</p>
<p>WEN. Nay, honest Frank, hast thou found a trick for him? if thou hast
not, look, here's a line to direct thee. First draw him into bands[362]
for money, then to dice for it; then take up stuff at the mercer's;
straight to a punk with it; then mortgage his land, and be drunk with
that; so with them and the rest, from an ancient gentleman make him a
young beggar.</p>
<p>ILF. What a rogue this is, to read a lecture to me—and mine own lesson
too, which he knows I have made perfect to nine hundred fourscore and
nineteen! A cheating rascal! will teach me!—I, that have made them,
that have worn a spacious park, lodge, and all on their backs[363] this
morning, been fain to pawn it afore night! And they that have stalked
like a huge elephant, with a castle on their necks, and removed that to
their own shoulders in one day, which their fathers built up in seven
years—been glad by my means, in so much time as a child sucks, to drink
bottle-ale, though a punk pay for't. And shall this parrot instruct me?</p>
<p>WEN. Nay, but, Frank—</p>
<p>ILF. A rogue that hath fed upon me and the fruit of my wit, like
pullen[364] from a pantler's chippings, and now I have put him into good
clothes to shift two suits in a day, that could scarce shift a patched
shirt once in a year, and say his prayers when he had it—hark, how he
prates!</p>
<p>WEN. Besides, Frank, since his marriage, he stalks me like a cashiered
captain discontent; in, which melancholy the least drop of mirth, of
which thou hast an ocean, will make him and all his ours for ever.</p>
<p>ILF. Says mine own rogue so? Give me thy hand then; we'll do't, and
there's earnest. [<emphasis>Strikes him</emphasis>.] 'Sfoot, you chittiface, that looks
worse than a collier through a wooden window, an ape afraid of a whip,
or a knave's head, shook seven years in the weather upon London
Bridge[365]—do you catechise me?</p>
<p>WEN. Nay, but valorous Frank, he that knows the secrets of all hearts
knows I did it in kindness.</p>
<p>ILF. Know your seasons: besides, I am not of that species for you to
instruct. Then know your seasons.</p>
<p>BAR. 'Sfoot, friends, friends, all friends; here comes young Scarborow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should he know of this, all our designs were prevented.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SCARBOROW.</p>
<p>ILF. What! melancholy, my young master, my young married man? God give
your worship joy.</p>
<p>SCAR. Joy of what, Frank?</p>
<p>ILF. Of thy wealth, for I hear of few that have joy of their wives.</p>
<p>SCAR. Who weds as I have to enforced sheets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His care increaseth, but his comfort fleets.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. Thou having so much wit, what a devil meant'st thou to marry?</p>
<p>SCAR. O, speak not of it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marriage sounds in mine ear like a bell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not rung for pleasure, but a doleful knell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. A common course: those men that are married in the morning to wish
themselves buried ere night.</p>
<p>SCAR. I cannot love her.</p>
<p>ILF. No news neither. Wives know that's a general fault amongst their
husbands.</p>
<p>SCAR. I will not lie with her.</p>
<p>ILF. <emphasis>Caeteri volunt</emphasis>, she'll say still;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you will not, another will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Why did she marry me, knowing I did not love her?</p>
<p>ILF. As other women do, either to be maintained by you, or to make you
a cuckold. Now, sir, what come you for?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CLOWN.</p>
<p>CLOWN. As men do in haste, to make an end of their business.</p>
<p>ILF. What's your business?</p>
<p>CLOWN. My business is this, sir—this, sir—and this, sir.</p>
<p>ILF. The meaning of all this, sir?</p>
<p>CLOWN. By this is as much as to say, sir, my master has sent unto you;
by this is as much as to say, sir, my master has him humbly commended
unto you; and by this is as much as to say, my master craves your
answer.</p>
<p>ILF. Give me your letter, and you shall have this, sir, this, sir, and
this, sir.    [<emphasis>Offers to strike him</emphasis>.</p>
<p>CLOWN. No, sir.</p>
<p>ILF. Why, sir?</p>
<p>CLOWN. Because, as the learned have very well instructed me, <emphasis>Qui supra
nos, nihil ad nos</emphasis>, and though many gentlemen will have to do with other
men's business, yet from me know the most part of them prove knaves for
their labour.</p>
<p>WEN. You ha' the knave, i'faith, Frank.</p>
<p>CLOWN. Long may he live to enjoy it. From Sir John Harcop, of Harcop, in
the county of York, Knight, by me his man, to yourself my young master,
by these presents greeting.</p>
<p>ILF. How cam'st thou by these good words?</p>
<p>CLOWN. As you by your good clothes, took them upon trust, and swore I
would never pay for them.</p>
<p>SCAR. Thy master, Sir John Harcop, writes to me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I should entertain thee for my man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His wish is acceptable; thou art welcome, fellow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, but thy master's daughter sends an article,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which makes me think upon my present sin;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here she remembers me to keep in mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My promis'd faith to her, which I ha' broke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here she remembers me I am a man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Black'd o'er with perjury, whose sinful breast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is charactered like those curst of the blest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. How now, my young bully, like a young wench, forty weeks after the
loss of her maidenhead, crying out.</p>
<p>SCAR. Trouble me not. Give me pen, ink, and paper;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will write to her. O! but what shall I write</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In mine excuse?[366] why, no excuse can serve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For him that swears, and from his oath doth swerve.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or shall I say my marriage was enforc'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twas bad in them; not well in me to yield:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wretched they two, whose marriage was compell'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll only write that which my grief hath bred:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forgive me, Clare, for I am married:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis soon set down, but not so soon forgot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or worn from hence—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Deliver it unto her, there's for thy pains.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would I as soon could cleanse these perjur'd stains!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLOWN. Well, I could alter mine eyes from filthy mud into fair water:
you have paid for my tears, and mine eyes shall prove bankrouts, and
break out for you. Let no man persuade me: I will cry, and every town
betwixt Shoreditch Church and York Bridge shall bear me witness.
                                                              [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>SCAR. Gentlemen, I'll take my leave of you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She that I am married to, but not my wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will London leave, in Yorkshire lead our life.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. We must not leave you so, my young gallant; we three are sick in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

state, and your wealth must help to make us whole again. For this saying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

is as true as old—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Strife nurs'd 'twixt man and wife makes such a flaw,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How great soe'er their wealth, 'twill have a thaw.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                            [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SIR JOHN HARCOP <emphasis>with his daughter</emphasis> CLARE,
    <emphasis>and two younger brothers</emphasis>, THOMAS <emphasis>and</emphasis> JOHN SCARBOROW.</p>
<p>HAR. Brothers to him ere long shall be my son</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By wedding this young girl: you are welcome both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, kiss her, kiss her; though that she shall be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your brother's wife, to kiss the cheek is free.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Kiss, 'sfoot, what else? thou art a good plump wench, I like you
well; prythee, make haste and bring store of boys; but be sure they have
good faces, that they may call me uncle.</p>
<p>JOHN. Glad of so fair a sister, I salute you.</p>
<p>HAR. Good, good, i' faith, this kissing's good, i' faith,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I lov'd to smack it too when I was young,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But mum: they have felt thy cheek, Clare, let them hear thy tongue.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLARE. Such welcome as befits my Scarborow's brothers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From me his trothplight wife be sure to have,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And though my tongue prove scant in any part,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The bounds be sure are full large[367] in my heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Tut, that's not that we doubt on, wench; but do you hear, Sir
John? what do you think drew me from London and the Inns of Court thus
far into Yorkshire?</p>
<p>HAR. I guess, to see this girl shall be your sister.</p>
<p>THOM. Faith, and I guess partly so too, but the main was—and I will not
lie to you—that, your coming now in this wise into our kindred, I might
be acquainted with you aforehand, that after my brother had married your
daughter, I his brother might borrow some money of you.</p>
<p>HAR. What, do you borrow of your kindred, sir?</p>
<p>THOM. 'Sfoot, what else? they, having interest in my blood, why should I
not have interest in their coin? Besides, sir, I, being a younger
brother, would be ashamed of my generation if I would not borrow of any
man that would lend, especially of my affinity, of whom I keep a
calendar. And look you, sir, thus I go over them. First o'er my uncles:
after, o'er mine aunts: then up to my nephews: straight down to my
nieces: to this cousin Thomas and that cousin Jeffrey, leaving the
courteous claw given to none of their elbows, even unto the third and
fourth remove of any that hath interest in our blood. All which do, upon
their summons made by me, duly and faithfully provide for appearance.
And so, as they are, I hope we shall be, more entirely endeared, better
and more feelingly acquainted.[368]</p>
<p>HAR. You are a merry gentleman.</p>
<p>THOM. 'Tis the hope of money makes me so; and I know none but fools use
to be sad with it.</p>
<p>JOHN. From Oxford am I drawn from serious studies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Expecting that my brother still hath sojourn'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With you, his best of choice, and this good knight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>HAR. His absence shall not make our hearts less merry,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than if we had his presence. A day ere long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will bring him back, when one the other meets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At noon i'th' church, at night between the sheets.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'll wash this chat with wine. Some wine! fill up;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sharp'ner of the wit is a full cup.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so to you, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Do, and I'll drink to my new sister; but upon this condition,
that she may have quiet days, little rest o' nights, have pleasant
afternoons, be pliant to my brother, and lend me money, whensoe'er I'll
borrow it.</p>
<p>HAR. Nay, nay, nay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Women are weak, and we must bear with them:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your frolic healths are only fit for men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Well, I am contented; women must to the wall, though it be to a
feather-bed. Fill up, then.    [<emphasis>They drink</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> CLOWN.</p>
<p>CLOWN. From London am I come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though not with pipe and drum,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet I bring matter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In this poor paper</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will make my young mistress,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Delighting in kisses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do as all maidens will,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hearing of such an ill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As to have lost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The thing they wish'd most,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A husband, a husband,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A pretty sweet husband,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cry O, O, O,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And alas, and at last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ho, ho, ho,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As I do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLARE. Return'd so soon from London? what's the news?</p>
<p>CLOWN. O mistress, if ever you have seen Demoniseacleer, look into mine
eyes: mine eyes are Severn, plain Severn; the Thames nor the river of
Tweed are nothing to them: nay, all the rain that fell at Noah's flood
had not the discretion that my eyes have: that drunk but up the whole
world, and I have drowned all the way betwixt this and London.</p>
<p>CLARE. Thy news, good Robin.</p>
<p>CLOWN. My news, mistress? I'll tell you strange news. The dust upon
London way being so great, that not a lord, gentleman, knight, or knave
could travel, lest his eyes should be blown out: at last they all
agreed to hire me to go before them, when I, looking but upon this
letter, did with this water, this very water, lay the dust, as well as
if it had rained from the beginning of April till the last of May.</p>
<p>CLARE. A letter from my Scarborow I give it thy mistress.</p>
<p>CLOWN. But, mistress—</p>
<p>CLARE. Prythee, begone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not have my father nor these gentlemen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be witness of the comfort it doth bring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLOWN. O, but mistress—</p>
<p>CLARE. Prythee, begone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With this and the glad news leave me alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> CLOWN.</p>
<p>THOM. 'Tis your turn, knight; take your liquor, know I am bountiful;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll forgive any man anything that he owes me but his drink, and that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll be paid for.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CLARE. Nay, gentlemen, the honesty of mirth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Consists not in carousing with excess;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father hath more welcomes than in wine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pray you, no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Says my sister so? I'll be ruled by thee then. But do you hear? I
hope hereafter you'll lend me some money. Now we are half-drunk, let's
go to dinner. Come, knight.
                               [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Manet</emphasis> CLARE.</p>
<p>CLARE. I am glad you're gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall I now open't? no, I'll kiss it first,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because this outside last did kiss his hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within this fold (I'll call't a sacred sheet)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are writ black lines, where our white hearts shall meet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before I ope this door of my delight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Methinks I guess how kindly he doth write</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of his true love to me; as chuck, sweetheart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I prythee do not think the time too long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That keeps us from the sweets of marriage rites:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then he sets my name, and kisses it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wishing my lips his sheet to write upon;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With like desire (methinks) as mine own thoughts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ask him now here for me to look upon;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet at the last thinking his love too slack,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ere it arrive at my desired eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He hastens up his message with like speed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Even as I break this ope, wishing to read.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, what is here? mine eyes are not mine own;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sure, sure, they are not. [O eyes,]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though you have been my lamps this sixteen years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                          [<emphasis>Lets fall the letter</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You do belie my Scarborow reading so;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Forgive him, he is married</emphasis>, that were ill:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What lying lights are these? look, I have no such letter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No wedded syllable of the least wrong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Done to a trothplight virgin like myself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beshrew you for your blindness: <emphasis>Forgive him, he is married</emphasis>!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I know my Scarborow's constancy to me</p>

<p>THOM. Sister, God's precious, the cloth's laid, the meat cools, we all
stay, and your father calls for you.</p>

For being united his with plighted faiths,</p>
<empty-line/>

Whoever sues to me commits a sin,</p>
<empty-line/>

Besiegeth me; and who shall marry me,</p>
<empty-line/>

Is like myself, lives in adultery. O God,</p>

That such hard fortune should betide my youth!</p>

I am young, fair, rich, honest, virtuous,</p>

I'm but his whore, live in adultery.</p>

I cannot step into the path of pleasure</p>

For which I was created, born unto:</p>

<p>

Let me live ne'er so honest, rich or poor,</p>

If I once wed, yet I must live a whore.</p>
<empty-line/>

I must be made a strumpet 'gainst my will,</p>

<p>

A name I have abhorr'd; a shameful ill</p>

I have eschewed; and now cannot withstand it</p>

In myself. I am my father's only child:</p>

In me he hath a hope, though not his name</p>

Can be increas'd, yet by my issue</p>

His land shall be possess'd, his age delighted.</p>

To keep my soul unspotted, yet will he</p>

Enforce me to a marriage:</p>

So that my grief doth of that weight consist,</p>

<p>

It helps me not to yield nor to resist;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And was I then created for a whore? a whore!</p>

smoke through a chimney, that files[384] all the way it goes.</p>

<p>GRIPE. Not I, sir; the serjeants have.</p>
<p>ILF. But at your suit, Master Gripe: yet hear me, as I am a gentleman.</p>
<p>GRIPE. I rather you could say as you were an honest man, and then I

<p>ILF. Yet hear me.</p>
<p>GRIPE. Hear me no hearing; I lent you my money for goodwill.</p>
<p>ILF. And I spent it for mere necessity. I confess I owe you five hundred

either make me present payment, or put me in security—such as I shall

<p>ILF. Gentlemen, I am to prefer some conference and especially to you,
Master Scarborow: our meeting here for your mirth hath proved to me thus
adverse, that in your companies I am arrested. How ill it will stand
with the flourish of your reputations, when men of rank and note
communicate that I, Frank Ilford, gentleman, whose fortunes may
transcend to make ample gratuities future, and heap satisfaction for any
present extension of his friends' kindness, was enforced from the Mitre
in Bread Street to the Counter in the Poultry. For mine own part, if
you shall think it meet, and that it shall accord with the state of
gentry to submit myself from the feather-bed in the master's side[387]

shall buckle to my heels, instead of gilt spurs, the armour of patience,

<p>

Enforceth us to question for our own,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The rather that we see, not like a brother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our brother keeps from us to spend on other.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. True, he has in his hands our portions—the patrimony which our
father gave us, with which he lies fatting himself with sack and
sugar[389] in the house, and we are fain to walk with lean purses
abroad. Credit must be maintained, which will not be without money; good
clothes must be had, which will not be without money; company must be
kept, which will not be without money; all which we must have, and from
him we will have money.</p>
<p>JOHN. Besides, we have brought our sister to this town,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That she herself, having her own from him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Might bring herself in court to be preferr'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Under some noble personage; or else that he,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose friends are great in court by his late match,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As he is in nature bound, provide for her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. And he shall do it, brother, though we have waited at his lodging
longer than a tailor's bill on a young knight for an old reckoning,
without speaking with him. Here we know he is, and we will call him to
parley.</p>
<p>JOHN. Yet let us do't in mild and gentle terms;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fair words perhaps may sooner draw our own</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than rougher course,[390] by which is mischief grown.</p>

<p>THOM. Here comes a drawer, we will question him. Do you hear, my friend?
is not Master Scarborow here?</p>
<p>DRAW. Here, sir! what a jest is that! where should he be else? I would
have you well know my master hopes to grow rich,[392] before he leave
him.</p>
<p>JOHN. How long hath he continued here, since he came hither?</p>
<p>DRAW. Faith, sir, not so long as Noah's flood, yet long enough to have
drowned up the livings of three knights, as knights go nowadays—some
month, or thereabouts.</p>
<p>JOHN. Time ill-consum'd to ruinate our house;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But what are they that keep him company?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DRAW. Pitch, pitch; but I must not say so; but, for your further
satisfaction, did you ever see a young whelp and a lion play together?</p>
<p>JOHN. Yes.</p>

Young heirs left in this town, where sin's so rank,</p>

And prodigals gape to grow fat by them,</p>

With such as waste their goods, as tire[395] the world</p>

With a continual spending, nor that you keep</p>

The company of a most leprous rout,</p>
<empty-line/>

Consumes your body's wealth, infects your name</p>

With such plague sores that, had you reason's eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twould make you sick to see you visit them—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath drawn us, but our wants to crave the due</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our father gave, and yet remains with you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Our birthright, good brother; this town craves maintenance; silk
stockings must be had, and we would be loth our heritage should be
arraigned at the vintner's bar, and so condemned to the vintner's box.
Though, while you did keep house, we had some belly timber at your table
or so; yet we would have you think we are your brothers, yet no Esaus,
to sell our patrimony for porridge.</p>
<p>SCAR. So, so; what hath your coming else?</p>
<p>JOHN. With us our sister joins in our request,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom we have brought along with us to London,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To have her portion, wherewith to provide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An honour'd service or an honest bride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. So then you two my brothers, and she my sister, come not, as in
duty you are bound, to an elder brother out of Yorkshire to see us, but
like leeches to suck from us.</p>
<p>JOHN. We come compelled by want to crave our own.</p>
<p>SCAR. Sir, for your own? then thus be satisfied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Both hers and yours were left in trust with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will keep it for ye: must you appoint us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or what we please to like mix with reproof?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have been too saucy both, and you shall know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll curb you for it: ask why? I'll have it so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN. We do but crave our own.</p>
<p>SCAR. Your own, sir? what's your own?</p>
<p>THOM. Our portions given us by our father's will.</p>
<p>JOHN. Which here you spend.</p>
<p>THOM. Consume.</p>
<p>JOHN. Ways worse than ill.</p>
<p>SCAR. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> ILFORD.</p>
<p>ILF. Nay, nay, nay, Will: prythee, come away, we have a full gallon of
sack stays in the fire for thee. Thou must pledge it to the health of a
friend of thine.</p>
<p>SCAR. What dost think these are, Frank?</p>
<p>ILF. Who? They are fiddlers, I think. If they be, I prythee send them
into the next room, and let them scrape there, and we'll send to them
presently.</p>
<p>SCAR. They are my brothers, Frank, come out of Yorkshire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To the tavern here, to ask their portions:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They call my pleasures riots, my company leprous;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And like a schoolboy they would tutor me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. O, thou shouldst have done well to have bound them 'prentices when
they were young; they would have made a couple of good saucy tailors.</p>
<p>THOM. Tailors?</p>
<p>ILF. Ay, birdlime tailors. Tailors are good men, and in the term-time
they wear good clothes. Come, you must learn more manners: as to stand
at your brother's back, to shift a trencher neatly, and take a cup of
sack and a capon's leg contentedly.</p>
<p>THOM. You are a slave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That feeds upon my brother like a fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Poisoning where thou dost suck.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. You lie.</p>
<p>JOHN. O (to my grief I speak it), you shall find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There's no more difference in a tavern-haunter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than is between a spital and a beggar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Thou work'st on him like tempests on a ship.</p>
<p>JOHN. And he the worthy traffic that doth sink.</p>
<p>THOM. Thou mak'st his name more loathesome than a grave.</p>
<p>JOHN. Livest like a dog by vomit.</p>
<p>THOM. Die a slave!</p>
<p>    [<emphasis>Here they draw</emphasis>, WENTLOE <emphasis>and</emphasis> BARTLEY <emphasis>come in, and the
    two vintner's boys with clubs. All set upon the two brothers</emphasis>.
    BUTLER, <emphasis>Scarborow's man, comes in, stands by, sees them fight,
    takes part with neither</emphasis>.</p>
<p>BUT. Do, fight. I love you all well, because you were my old master's
sons, but I'll neither part you, nor be partaker with you. I come to
bring my master news; he hath two sons born at a birth in Yorkshire, and
I find him together by the ears with his brothers in a tavern in London.
Brother and brother at odds, 'tis naught: sure it was not thus in the
days of charity. What's this world like to? Faith, just like an
innkeeper's chamber-pot, receives all waters, good and bad. It had need
of much scouring. My old master kept a good house, and twenty or thirty
tall sword-and-buckler men about him, and i'faith his son differs not
much, he will have metal too; though he hath not store of cutler's
blades, he will have plenty of vintner's pots. His father kept a good
house for honest men his tenants, that brought him in part; and his son
keeps a bad house with knaves that help to consume all. 'Tis but the
change of time; why should any man repine at it? Crickets, good, loving,
and lucky worms, were wont to feed, sing, and rejoice in the father's
chimney, and now carrion crows build in the son's kitchen. I could be
sorry for it, but I am too old to weep. Well then, I will go tell him
news of his offspring.

I ask'd him for our portions, told him that you</p>

Humbly we crav'd our own; when his reply</p>

<p>THOM. In troth, sister, we two to beg in the fields,</p>

And you to betake yourself to the old trade,</p>

Filling of small cans in the suburbs.</p>

acorns, let me live with nothing but pollard, and my mouth be made a
cucking-stool for every scold to set her tail on.</p>
<p>THOM. How now, butler, what's the meaning of this?</p>
<p>BUT. Your brother means to lame as many as he can, that when he is a
beggar himself, he may live with them in the hospital. His wife sent me
out of Yorkshire to tell him that God had blessed him with two sons; he
bids a plague of them, a vengeance of her, crosses me o'er the pate, and
sends me to the surgeon's to seek salve: I looked, at least he should
have given me a brace of angels for my pains.</p>
<p>THOM. Thou hast not lost all thy longing; I am sure he hath given thee a
cracked crown!</p>
<p>BUT. A plague on his fingers! I cannot tell, he is your brother and my
master; I would be loth to prophesy of him; but whosoe'er doth curse his
children being infants, ban his wife lying in childbed, and beats his
man brings him news of it, they may be born rich, but they shall live
slaves, be knaves, and die beggars.</p>
<p>SIS. Did he do so?</p>

to the surgeon's.</p>

Some husbands are respectless of their wives,</p>

<p>SIS. Jest not at her whose burden is too grievous,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But rather lend a means how to relieve us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. Well, I do pity you, and the rather because you say you would fain
live honest, and want means for it; for I can tell you 'tis as strange
here to see a maid fair, poor, and honest, as to see a collier with a
clean face. Maids here do live (especially without maintenance)
Like mice going to a trap,
They nibble long, at last they get a clap.
Your father was my good benefactor, and gave me a house whilst I live
to put my head in: I would be loth then to see his only daughter, for
want of means, turn punk. I have a drift to keep you honest, have you a
care to keep yourself so: yet you shall not know of it, for women's
tongues are like sieves, they will hold nothing they have power to vent.
You two will further me?</p>
<p>JOHN. In anything, good honest Butler.</p>
<p>THOM. If't be to take a purse, I'll be one.</p>
<p>BUT. Perhaps thou speakest righter than thou art aware of. Well, as
chance is, I have received my wages; there is forty shillings for you,
I'll set you in a lodging, and till you hear from us, let that provide
for you: we'll first to the surgeon's.</p>
<p>    To keep you honest, and to keep you brave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For once an honest man will turn a knave.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SCARBOROW, <emphasis>having a boy carrying a torch
    with him</emphasis>: ILFORD, WENTLOE, <emphasis>and</emphasis> BARTLEY.</p>
<p>SCAR. Boy, bear the torch fair: now am I armed to fight with a windmill,
and to take the wall of an emperor; much drink, no money: a heavy head
and a light pair of heels.</p>
<p>WEN. O, stand, man.</p>
<p>SCAR. I were an excellent creature to make a punk of; I should down with
the least touch of a knave's finger. Thou hast made a good night of
this: what hast won, Frank?</p>
<p>ILF. A matter of nothing, some hundred pounds.</p>
<p>SCAR. This is the hell of all gamesters. I think, when they are at play,
the board eats up the money; for if there be five hundred pound lost,
there's never but a hundred pounds won. Boy, take the wall of any man:
and yet by light such deeds of darkness may not be.</p>
<p>                              [<emphasis>Put out the torch</emphasis>.</p>
<p>WEN. What dost mean by that, Will?</p>
<p>SCAR. To save charge, and walk like a fury with a firebrand in my hand:
every one goes by the light, and we'll go by the smoke.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> LORD FALCONBRIDGE.</p>
<p>SCAR. Boy, keep the wall: I will not budge[397] for any man, by these
thumbs; and the paring of the nails shall stick in thy teeth. Not for a
world.</p>
<p>LORD. Who's this? young Scarborow?</p>
<p>SCAR. The man that the mare rid on.</p>
<p>LORD. Is this the reverence that you owe to me.</p>
<p>SCAR. You should have brought me up better.</p>
<p>LORD. That vice should thus transform man to a beast!</p>
<p>SCAR. Go to, your name's lord; I'll talk with you, when you're out of
debt and have better clothes.</p>
<p>LORD. I pity thee even with my very soul.</p>
<p>SCAR. Pity i' thy throat! I can drink muscadine and eggs, and mulled
sack; do you hear? you put a piece of turned stuff upon me, but I
will—</p>
<p>LORD. What will you do, sir?</p>
<p>SCAR. Piss in thy way, and that's no slander.</p>
<p>LORD. Your sober blood will teach you otherwise.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SIR WILLIAM SCARBOROW.</p>
<p>SIR WIL. My honoured lord, you're happily well-met.</p>
<p>LORD. Ill met to see your nephew in this case,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More like a brute beast than a gentleman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR WIL. Fie, nephew! shame you not thus to transform yourself?</p>
<p>SCAR. Can your nose smell a torch?</p>
<p>ILF. Be not so wild; it is thine uncle Scarborow.</p>
<p>SCAR. Why then 'tis the more likely 'tis my father's brother.</p>
<p>SIR WIL. Shame to our name to make thyself a beast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy body worthy born, and thy youth's breast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till'd in due time for better discipline.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LORD. Thyself new-married to a noble house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rich in possessions and posterity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which should call home thy unstay'd affections.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR WIL. Where thou mak'st havoc.</p>
<p>LORD. Riot, spoil, and waste.</p>
<p>SIR WIL. Of what thy father left.</p>
<p>LORD. And livest disgraced.</p>
<p>SCAR. I'll send you shorter to heaven than you came to the earth. Do you
catechise? do you catechise?    [<emphasis>He draws, and strikes at them</emphasis>.</p>
<p>ILF. Hold, hold! do you draw upon your uncle?</p>
<p>SCAR. Pox of that lord!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We'll meet at th'Mitre, where we'll sup down sorrow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We are drunk to-night, and so we'll be to-morrow.</p>

<p>                                           [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>LORD. Why, now I see: what I heard of, I believed not,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your kinsman lives—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR WIL. Like to a swine.</p>
<p>LORD. A perfect Epythite,[398] he feeds on draff,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wallows in the mire, to make men laugh:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I pity him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR WIL. No pity's fit for him.</p>
<p>LORD. Yet we'll advise him.</p>
<p>SIR WIL. He is my kinsman.</p>
<p>LORD. Being in the pit, where many do fall in,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We will both comfort him and counsel him.</p>

<p><strong>ACT IV.</strong></p>
<p>    <emphasis>A noise within, crying Follow, follow, follow! then enter</emphasis>
    BUTLER, THOMAS <emphasis>and</emphasis> JOHN SCARBOROW, <emphasis>with money-bags</emphasis>.</p>
<p>THOM. What shall we do now, butler?</p>
<p>BUT. A man had better line a good handsome pair of gallows before his
time, than be born to do these sucklings good, their mother's milk not
wrung out of their nose yet; they know no more how to behave themselves
in this honest and needful calling of pursetaking, than I do to piece
stockings.</p>
<p>WITHIN. This way, this way, this way!</p>
<p>BOTH. 'Sfoot, what shall we do now?</p>
<p>BUT. See if they do not quake like a trembling asp-leaf, and look more
miserable than one of the wicked elders pictured in the painted
cloth.[399] Should they but come to the credit to be arraigned for their
valour before a worshipful bench, their very looks would hang 'em, and
they were indicted but for stealing of eggs.</p>
<p>WITHIN. Follow, follow! This way! Follow!</p>
<p>THOM. Butler.</p>
<p>JOHN. Honest butler.</p>
<p>BUT. Squat, heart, squat, creep me into these bushes, and lie me as
close to the ground as you would do to a wench.</p>
<p>THOM. How, good butler? show us how.</p>
<p>BUT. By the moon, patroness of all pursetakers, who would be troubled
with such changelings? squat, heart, squat.</p>
<p>THOM. Thus, butler?</p>
<p>BUT. Ay so, suckling, so; stir not now: if the peering rogues chance to
go over you, yet stir not: younger brothers call you them, and have no
more forecast, I am ashamed of you. These are such whose fathers had
need leave them money, even to make them ready withal; for, by these
hilts, they have not wit to button their sleeves without teaching:
close, squat, close. Now if the lot of hanging do fall to my share, so;
then the old father's[400] man drops for his young masters. If it
chance, it chances; and when it chances, heaven and the sheriff send me
a good rope! I would not go up the ladder twice for anything: in the
meantime preventions, honest preventions do well, off with my skin; so;
you on the ground, and I to this tree, to escape the gallows.
                                                    [<emphasis>Ascends a tree</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>WITHIN. Follow, follow, follow!</p>
<p>BUT. Do: follow. If I do not deceive you, I'll bid a pox of this wit,
and hang with a good grace.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SIR JOHN HARCOP, <emphasis>with two or three others with him</emphasis>.</p>
<p>HAR. Up to this wood they took: search near, my friends, I am this morn
robbed of three hundred pound.</p>
<p>BUT. I am sorry there was not four to make even money. Now, by the
devil's horns, 'tis Sir John Harcop.</p>
<p>HAR. Leave not a bush unbeat nor tree unsearch'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As sure as I was robb'd, the thieves went this way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. There's nobody, I perceive, but may lie at some time, for one of
them climbed this way.</p>
<p>1ST MAN. Stand, I hear a voice; and here's an owl in an ivy-bush.</p>
<p>BUT. You lie, 'tis an old servingman in a nut-tree.</p>
<p>2D MAN. Sirrah, sir, what make you in that tree?</p>
<p>BUT. Gathering of nuts, that such fools as you are may crack the shells,
and I eat the kernels.</p>
<p>HAR. What fellow's that?</p>
<p>BUT. Sir John Harcop, my noble knight; I am glad of your good health;
you bear your age fair, you keep a good house, I have fed at your board,
and been drunk in your buttery.</p>
<p>HAR. But sirrah, sirrah, what made you in that tree?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My man and I, at foot of yonder hill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were by three knaves robb'd of three hundred pound.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. A shrewd loss, by'r Lady, sir; but your good worship may now see
the fruit of being miserable: you will ride but with one man to save
horse-meat and man's meat at your inn at night, and lose three hundred
pound in a morning.</p>
<p>HAR. Sirrah, I say I have lost three hundred pound.</p>
<p>BUT. And I say, sir, I wish all miserable knights might be served so;
for had you kept half a dozen tall fellows, as a man of your coat should
do, they would have helped now to keep your money.</p>
<p>HAR. But tell me, sir, why lurked you in that tree?</p>
<p>BUT. Marry, I will tell you, sir. Coming to the top of the hill where
you (right worshipful) were robbed at the bottom, and seeing some
a-scuffling together, my mind straight gave me there were knaves abroad:
now, sir, I knowing myself to be old, tough, and unwieldy, not being
able to do as I would, as much as to say rescue you (right
worshipful)—I, like an honest man, one of the king's liege people, and
a good subject—</p>
<p>SER. But he says well, sir.</p>
<p>BUT. Got me up to the top of that tree: the tree (if it could speak)
would bear me witness, that there I might see which way the knaves took,
then to tell you of it, and you right worshipfully to send hue and[401]
cry after them.</p>
<p>HAR. Was it so?</p>
<p>BUT. Nay, 'twas so, sir.</p>
<p>HAR. Nay, then, I tell thee they took into this wood.</p>
<p>BUT. And I tell thee (setting thy worship's knighthood aside) he lies in
his throat that says so: had not one of them a white frock? did they not
bind your worship's knighthood by the thumbs? then faggoted you and the
fool your man back to back.</p>
<p>MAN. He says true.</p>
<p>BUT. Why, then, so truly came not they into this wood, but took over the
lawns, and left Winnowe steeple on the left hand.</p>
<p>HAR. It may be so. By this they are out of reach;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, farewell it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. Ride with more men, good knight.</p>
<p>HAR. It shall teach me wit.</p>
<p>                     [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>. HARCOP <emphasis>with followers</emphasis>.</p>
<p>BUT. So, if this be not played a weapon beyond a scholar's prize, let me
be hissed at. Now to the next. Come out, you hedgehogs!</p>
<p>THOM. O butler! thou deserv'st to be chronicled for this.</p>
<p>BUT. Do not belie me, if I had any right, I deserve to be hanged for't.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But come, down with your dust, our morning's purchase.[402]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Here 'tis; thou hast played well; thou deserv'st two shares in it.</p>
<p>BUT. Three hundred pound! a pretty breakfast: many a man works hard all
his days, and never sees half the money. But come, though it be badly
got, it shall be better bestowed. But do ye hear, gallants? I have not
taught you this trade to get your livings by. Use it not; for if you
do, though I 'scaped by the nut-tree, be sure you'll speed by the rope.
But for your pains at this time, there's a hundred pounds for you; how
you shall bestow it, I'll give you instructions. But do you hear? look
ye, go not to your gills, your punks, and your cock-tricks with it. If I
hear you do, as I am an honest thief, though I helped you now out of the
briars, I'll be a means yet to help you to the gallows. How the rest
shall be employed, I have determined, and by the way I'll make you
acquainted with it.
To steal is bad, but taken, where is store;
The fault's the less, being done to help the poor.</p>
<p>                                         [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> WENTLOE, BARTLEY, <emphasis>and</emphasis> ILFORD <emphasis>with a letter in his hand</emphasis>.</p>
<p>ILF. Sure, I have said my prayers, and lived virtuously o' late, that
this good fortune's befallen me. Look, gallants, I am sent for to come
down to my father's burial.</p>
<p>WEN. But dost mean to go?</p>
<p>ILF. Troth, no; I'll go down to take possession of his land: let the
country bury him, and they will. I'll stay here a while, to save charge
at his funeral.</p>
<p>BAR. And how dost feel thyself, Frank, now thy father is dead?</p>
<p>ILF. As I did before, with my hands; how should I feel myself else? but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll tell you news, gallants.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WEN. What's that? dost mean now to serve God?</p>
<p>ILF. Faith, partly; for I intend shortly to go to church, and from
thence do faithful service to one woman.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> BUTLER.</p>
<p>BUT. Good! I have met my flesh-hooks together.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>BAR. What, dost mean to be married?</p>
<p>ILF. Ay, mongrel, married.</p>
<p>BUT. That's a bait for me.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>ILF. I will now be honestly married.</p>
<p>WEN. It's impossible, for thou hast been a whoremaster this seven year.</p>
<p>ILF. 'Tis no matter; I will now marry, and to some honest woman too; and
so from hence her virtues shall be a countenance to my vices.</p>
<p>BAR. What shall she be, prythee?</p>
<p>ILF. No lady, no widow, nor no waiting gentlewoman, for under protection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ladies may lard their husbands' heads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Widows will woodcocks make,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And chambermaids of servingmen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Learn that they'll never forsake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WEN. Who wilt thou wed then, prythee?</p>
<p>ILF. To any maid, so she be fair:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To any maid, so she be rich:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To any maid, so she be young:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to any maid—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BAR. So she be honest.</p>
<p>ILF. Faith, it's no great matter for her honesty, for in these days
that's a dowry out of request.</p>
<p>BUT. From these crabs will I gather sweetness: wherein I'll imitate the
bee, that sucks her honey, not from the sweetest flowers, but [from]
thyme, the bitterest: so these having been the means to beggar my
master, shall be the helps to relieve his brothers and sister.
                                                             [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>ILF. To whom shall I now be a suitor?</p>
<p>BUT. Fair fall ye, gallants.</p>
<p>ILF. Nay, and she be fair, she shall fall sure enough. Butler, how
is't, good butler?</p>
<p>BUT. Will you be made gallants?</p>
<p>WEN. Ay, but not willingly cuckolds, though we are now talking about
wives.</p>
<p>BUT. Let your wives agree of that after: will you first be richly
married?</p>
<p>ALL. How, butler? richly married?</p>
<p>BUT. Rich in beauty, rich in purse, rich in virtue, rich in all things.
But mum, I'll say nothing, I know of two or three rich heirs. But
cargo![403] my fiddlestick cannot play without rosin: avaunt.</p>
<p>WEN. Butler.</p>
<p>ILF. Dost not know me, butler?</p>
<p>BUT. For kex,[404] dried kex, that in summer has been so liberal to
fodder other men's cattle, and scarce have enough to keep your own in
winter. Mine are precious cabinets, and must have precious jewels put
into them, and I know you to be merchants of stock-fish, dry-meat,[405]
and not men for my market: then vanish.</p>
<p>ILF. Come, ye old madcap, you: what need all this? cannot a man have
been a little whoremaster in his youth, but you must upbraid him with
it, and tell him of his defects which, when he is married, his wife
shall find in him? Why, my father's dead, man, now; who by his death has
left me the better part of a thousand a year.</p>
<p>BUT. Tut, she of Lancashire has fifteen hundred.</p>
<p>ILF. Let me have her then, good butler.</p>
<p>BUT. And then she, the bright beauty of Leicestershire, has a thousand,
nay, thirteen hundred a year, at least.</p>
<p>ILF. O, let me have her, honest butler.</p>
<p>BUT. Besides, she the most delicate, sweet countenanced, black-browed
gentlewoman in Northamptonshire, in substance equals the best of them.</p>
<p>ILF. Let me have her then.</p>
<p>BAR. Or I.</p>
<p>WEN. Or I, good butler.</p>
<p>BUT. You were best play the parts of right fools and most desperate
whoremasters, and go together by the ears for them, ere ye see them.
But they are the most rare-featured, well-faced, excellent-spoke,
rare-qualitied, virtuous, and worthy-to-be-admired gentlewomen.</p>
<p>ALL. And rich, butler?</p>
<p>BUT. Ay, that must be one, though they want all the rest [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>];
—and rich, gallants, as are from the utmost parts of Asia to the
present confines of Europe.</p>
<p>ALL. And wilt thou help us to them, butler?</p>
<p>BUT. Faith, 'tis to be doubted; for precious pearl will hardly be bought
without precious stones, and I think there's scarce one indifferent one
to be found betwixt you three: yet since there is some hope ye may prove
honest, as by the death of your fathers you are proved rich, walk
severally; for I, knowing you all three to be covetous tug-muttons, will
not trust you with the sight of each other's beauty, but will severally
talk with you: and since you have deigned in this needful portion of
wedlock to be ruled by me, Butler will most bountifully provide wives
for you generally.</p>
<p>ALL. Why, that's honestly said.    [<emphasis>He walks with each apart</emphasis>.</p>
<p>BUT. Why so: and now first to you, sir knight.</p>
<p>ILF. Godamercy.</p>
<p>BUT. You see this couple of abominable woodcocks here.</p>
<p>ILF. A pox on them! absolute coxcombs.</p>
<p>BUT. You heard me tell them I had intelligence to give of three
gentlewomen.</p>
<p>ILF. True.</p>
<p>BUT. Now indeed, sir, I have but the performance of one.</p>
<p>ILF. Good.</p>
<p>BUT. And her I do intend for you, only for you.</p>
<p>ILF. Honest butler.</p>
<p>BUT. Now, sir, she being but lately come to this town, and so nearly
watched by the jealous eyes of her friends, she being a rich heir,[406]
lest she should be stolen away by some dissolute prodigal or
desperate-estated spendthrift, as you have been, sir—</p>
<p>ILF. O, but that's passed, butler.</p>
<p>BUT. True, I know't, and intend now but to make use of them, flatter
them with hopeful promises, and make them needful instruments.</p>
<p>ILF. To help me to the wench?</p>
<p>BUT. You have hit it—which thus must be effected: first by keeping
close your purpose.</p>
<p>ILF. Good.</p>
<p>BUT. Also concealing from them the lodging, beauty, and riches of your
new, but admirable mistress.</p>
<p>ILF. Excellent.</p>
<p>BUT. Of which your following happiness if they should know, either in
envy of your good or hope of their own advancement, they'd make our
labours known to the gentlewoman's uncles, and so our benefit be
frustrate.</p>
<p>ILF. Admirable, butler.</p>
<p>BUT. Which done, all's but this: being, as you shall be, brought into
her company, and by my praising your virtues, you get possession of her
love, one morning step to the Tower, or to make all sure, hire some
stipendiary priest for money—for money in these days what will not be
done, and what will not a man do for a rich wife?—and with him make no
more ado but marry her in her lodging, and being married, lie with her,
and spare not.</p>
<p>ILF. Do they not see us, do they not see us? let me kiss thee, let me
kiss thee, butler! let but this be done, and all the benefit, requital
and happiness I can promise thee for't, shall be this—I'll be thy rich
master, and thou shalt carry my purse.</p>
<p>BUT. Enough, meet me at her lodging some half an hour hence: hark, she
lies—[407]</p>
<p>ILF. I ha't.</p>
<p>BUT. Fail not.</p>
<p>ILF. Will I live?</p>
<p>BUT. I will, but shift off these two rhinoceros.</p>
<p>ILF. Widgeons, widgeons: a couple of gulls!</p>
<p>BUT. With some discourse of hope to wive them too, and be with you
straight.</p>
<p>ILF. Blessed day! my love shall be thy cushion, honest butler.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                                       [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. So now to my t'other gallants.</p>
<p>WEN. O butler, we have been in passion at thy tediousness.</p>
<p>BUT. Why, look you, I had all this talk for your good!</p>
<p>BAR. Hadst?</p>
<p>BUT. For you know the knight is but a scurvy-proud-prating prodigal,
licentious, unnecessary—</p>
<p>WEN. An ass, an ass, an ass.</p>
<p>BUT. Now you heard me tell him I had three wenches in store.</p>
<p>BAR. And he would have had them all, would he?</p>
<p>BUT. Hear me. Though he may live to be an ox, he had not now so much of
the goat in him, but only hopes for one of the three, when indeed I have
but two; and knowing you to be men of more virtue, and dearer in my
respect, intend them to be yours.</p>
<p>WEN. We shall honour thee.</p>
<p>BAR. But how, butler?</p>
<p>BUT. I am now going to their place of residence, situate in the choicest
place of the city, and at the sign of the Wolf, just against Goldsmith's
Row, where you shall meet me; but ask not for me, only walk to and fro,
and to avoid suspicion you may spend some conference with the
shopkeeper's wives[408]; they have seats built a purpose for such
familiar entertainment—where, from a bay-window[409] which is opposite,
I will make you known to your desired beauties, commend the good parts
you have—</p>
<p>WEN. By the mass, mine are very few.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>BUT. And win a kind of desire, as women are soon won, to make you be
beloved; where you shall first kiss, then woo, at length wed, and at
last bed, my noble hearts.</p>
<p>BOTH. O butler!</p>
<p>BUT. Wenches, bona robas[410], blessed beauties, without colour or
counterfeit. Away, put on your best clothes, get you to the barber's,
curl up your hair, walk with the best struts you can: you shall see more
at the window, and I have vowed to make you—</p>
<p>BAR. Wilt thou?</p>

O brother, brother, but for that honest man,</p>

As near to misery had been our breath,</p>

As where the thundering pellet strikes, is death.</p>

<p>BUT. God's precious, see the hell, sir: even as you had new-kissed, and
were about to court her, if her uncles be not come.</p>
<p>ILF. A plague on the spite on't.</p>
<p>BUT. But 'tis no matter, sir; stay you here in this upper chamber, and
I'll stay beneath with her: 'tis ten to one you shall hear them talk now
of the greatness of her possessions, the care they have to see her
well-bestowed, the admirableness of her virtues, all which for all their
coming shall be but happiness ordained for you, and by my means be your
inheritance.</p>
<p>ILF. Then thou'lt shift them away, and keep me from the sight of them?</p>
<p>BUT. Have I not promised to make you?</p>
<p>ILF. Thou hast.</p>
<p>BUT. Go to, then, rest here with patience, and be confident in my trust;
only in my absence you may praise God for the blessedness you have to
come, and say your prayers, if you will. I'll but prepare her heart for
entertainment of your love, dismiss them for your free access, and
return straight.</p>
<p>ILF. Honest-blessed-natural-friend, thou dealest with me like a brother,
butler. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis> BUTLER.] Sure, heaven hath reserved this man to wear
grey hairs to do me good. Now will I listen—listen close to suck in her
uncles' words with a rejoicing ear.</p>
<p>THOM. As we were saying, brother[413],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where shall we find a husband for my niece?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. Marry, she shall find one here, though you little know't. Thanks,
thanks, honest butler.</p>
<p>JOHN. She is rich in money, plate, and jewels.</p>
<p>ILF. Comfort, comfort to my soul.</p>
<p>THOM. Hath all her manor-houses richly furnished.</p>
<p>ILF. Good, good; I'll find employment for them.</p>
<p>BUT. <emphasis>within</emphasis>. Speak loud enough, that he may hear you.</p>
<p>JOHN. I take her estate to be about a thousand pound a year.</p>
<p>ILF. And that which my father hath left me will make it about fifteen
hundred. Admirable!</p>
<p>JOHN. In debt to no man: then must our natural care be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As she is wealthy, to see her married well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. And that she shall be as well as the priest can; he shall not leave
a word out.</p>
<p>THOM. I think she has—</p>

<p>THOM. About four thousand pound in her great chest.</p>
<p>ILF. And I'll find a vent for't, I hope.</p>
<p>JOHN. She is virtuous, and she is fair.</p>
<p>ILF. And she were foul, being rich, I would be glad of her.</p>

<p>ILF. You may chance be deceived, old greybeards; here's he will spend
some of it; thanks, thanks, honest butler! Now do I see the happiness of
my future estate. I walk me as to-morrow, being the day after my
marriage, with my fourteen men in livery-cloaks after me, and step to
the wall in some chief streets of the city, though I have no occasion to
use it, that the shopkeepers may take notice how many followers stand
bare to me. And yet in this latter age, the keeping of men being not in
request, I will turn my aforesaid fourteen into two pages and two
coaches. I will get myself into grace at court, run headlong into debt,
and then look scurvily upon the city. I will walk you into the presence
in the afternoon, having put on a richer suit than I wore in the
morning, and call, boy or sirrah. I will have the grace of some great
lady, though I pay for't, and at the next triumphs run a-tilt, that when
I run my course, though I break not my lance, she may whisper to
herself, looking upon my jewel: well-run, my knight. I will now keep
great horses, scorning to have a queen to keep me; indeed I will
practise all the gallantry in use; for by a wife comes all my happiness.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> BUTLER.</p>
<p>BUT. Now, sir, you have heard her uncles, and how do you like them?</p>
<p>ILF. O butler, they have made good thy words, and I am ravished with
them.</p>
<p>BUT. And having seen and kissed the gentlewoman, how do you like her?</p>
<p>ILF. O butler, beyond discourse, beyond any element; she's a paragon for
a prince, rather than a fit implement for a gentleman.[414]</p>
<p>BUT. Well then, since you like her, and by my means, she shall like you,
nothing rests now, but to have you married.</p>
<p>ILF. True, butler, but withal to have her portion!</p>
<p>BUT. Tut, that's sure yours, when you are married once, for 'tis hers by
inheritance; but do you love her?</p>
<p>ILF. O, with my soul.</p>
<p>BUT. Have you sworn as much?</p>
<p>ILF. To thee, to her; and have called heaven to witness.</p>
<p>BUT. How shall I know that?</p>
<p>ILF. Butler, here I protest, make vows irrevocable.</p>

<p>BUT. For her forsake all other women?</p>
<p>ILF. Nay, for her forswear all other women.</p>
<p>BUT. In all degrees of love?</p>
<p>ILF. In all degrees of love, either to court, kiss, give private
favours, or use private means. I'll do nothing that married men, being
close whoremasters, do, so I may have her.</p>
<p>BUT. And yet you, having been an open whoremaster, I will not believe
you till I hear you swear as much in the way of contract to herself,
and call me to be a witness.</p>
<p>ILF. By heaven, by earth, by hell, by all that man can swear, I will, so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I may have her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. Enough.</p>
<empty-line/>

The which loves you as angels love good men;</p>

<p>ILF. Mistress, I know your worth is beyond my desert; yet by my praising
of your virtues, I would not have you, as women use to do, become proud.</p>
<p>SIS. None of my affections are pride's children, nor akin to them.</p>
<p>ILF. Can you love me then?</p>
<p>SIS. I can; for I love all the world, but am in love with none.</p>
<p>ILF. Yet be in love with me; let your affections</p>

Combine with mine, and let our souls</p>

Your life's my life, your death my dying-day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIS. Sir, the commendations I have received from Butler of your birth
and worth, together with the judgment of mine own eye, bids me believe
and love you.</p>

<p>BUT. What, but be married straight, man?</p>

have provided you a priest.</p>
<p>ILF. Where? prythee, butler, where?</p>
<p>BUT. Where but beneath in her chamber? I have filled his hands with
coin, and he shall tie you fast with words; he shall close your hands in
one, and then do clap yourself into her sheets, and spare not.</p>

Have learn'd to love him that, being her husband,</p>

She marries him to help her nearest kin:</p>

<p>ILF. Ho, sirrah, who would have thought it? I perceive now a woman may
be a maid, be married, and lose her maidenhead, and all in half an hour.
And how dost like me now, wench?</p>
<p>SIS. As doth befit your servant and your wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That owe you love and duty all my life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. And there shall be no love lost, nor service neither; I'll do thee
service at board, and thou shalt do me service a-bed: now must I, as
young married men use to do, kiss my portion out of my young wife. Thou
art my sweet rogue, my lamb, my pigsny, my playfellow, my pretty-pretty
anything. Come, a buss, prythee, so 'tis my kind heart; and wots thou
what now?</p>
<p>SIS. Not till you tell me, sir.</p>
<p>ILF. I have got thee with child in my conscience, and, like a kind
husband, methinks I breed it for thee. For I am already sick at my
stomach, and long extremely. Now must thou be my helpful physician, and
provide for me.</p>
<p>SIS. Even to my blood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What's mine is yours, to gain your peace or good.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. What a kind soul is this! Could a man have found a greater content
in a wife, if he should have sought through the world for her? Prythee,
heart, as I said, I long, and in good troth I do, and methinks thy first
child will be born without a nose, if I lose my longing: 'tis but for a
trifle too; yet methinks it will do me no good, unless thou effect it
for me. I could take thy keys myself, go into thy closet, and read over
the deeds and evidences of thy land, and in reading over them, rejoice I
had such blessed fortune to have so fair a wife with so much endowment,
and then open thy chests, and survey thy plate, jewels, treasure; but a
pox on't, all will do me no good, unless thou effect it for me.</p>
<p>SIS. Sir, I will show you all the wealth I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of coin, of jewels, and possessions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. Good gentle heart, I'll give thee another buss for that: for that,
give thee a new gown to-morrow morning by this hand; do thou but dream
what stuff and what fashion thou wilt have it on to-night.</p>
<p>SIS. The land I can endow you with's my Love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The riches I possess for you is Love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A treasure greater than is land or gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It cannot be forfeit, and it shall ne'er be sold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. Love, I know that; and I'll answer thee love for love in abundance:
but come, prythee, come, let's see these deeds and evidences—this
money, plate, and jewels. Wilt have thy child born without a nose? if
thou be'st so careless, spare not: why, my little frappet, you, I heard
thy uncles talk of thy riches, that thou hadst hundreds a year, several
lordships, manors, houses, thousands of pounds in your great chest;
jewels, plate, and rings in your little box.</p>
<p>SIS. And for that riches you did marry me?</p>
<p>ILF. Troth, I did, as nowadays bachelors do: swear I lov'd thee, but
indeed married thee for thy wealth.</p>
<p>SIS. Sir, I beseech you say not your oaths were such,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So like false coin being put unto the touch;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who bear a flourish in the outward show</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of a true stamp, but truly[416] are not so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You swore me love, I gave the like to you:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then as a ship, being wedded to the sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Does either sail or sink, even so must I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You being the haven, to which my hopes must fly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. True, chuck, I am thy haven, and harbour too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And like a ship I took thee, who brings home treasure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As thou to me the merchant-venturer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIS. What riches I am ballast with are yours.</p>
<p>ILF. That's kindly said now.</p>
<p>SIS. If but with sand, as I am but with earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Being your right, of right you must receive me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have no other lading but my love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which in abundance I will render you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If other freight you do expect my store,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll pay you tears: my riches are no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. How's this? how's this? I hope you do but jest.</p>
<p>SIS. I am sister to decayed Scarborow.</p>
<p>ILF. Ha!</p>
<p>SIS. Whose substance your enticements did consume.</p>
<p>ILF. Worse than an ague.</p>
<p>SIS. Which as you did believe, so they supposed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twas fitter for yourself than for another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To keep the sister, had undone the brother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ILF. I am gulled, by this hand. An old coneycatcher, and beguiled! where
the pox now are my two coaches, choice of houses, several suits, a
plague on them, and I know not what! Do you hear, puppet, do you think
you shall not be damned for this, to cosen a gentleman of his hopes, and
compel yourself into matrimony with a man, whether he will or no with
you? I have made a fair match, i'faith: will any man buy my commodity
out of my hand? As God save me, he shall have her for half the money she
cost me.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> WENTLOE <emphasis>and</emphasis> BARTLEY.</p>
<p>WEN. O, have we met you, sir?</p>
<p>BAR. What, turned micher, steal a wife, and not make your old friends
acquainted with it?</p>
<p>ILF. A pox on her, I would you had her!</p>
<p>WEN. Well, God give you joy! we can hear of your good fortune, now 'tis
done, though we could not be acquainted with it aforehand.</p>
<p>BAR. As that you have two thousand pounds a year.</p>
<p>WEN. Two or three manor-houses.</p>

<p>ILF. Better, better, better.</p>
<p>WEN. And so many oxen, that their horns are able to store all the
cuckolds in your country.</p>
<p>ILF. Do not make me mad, good gentlemen, do not make me mad: I could be
made a cuckold with more patience, than endure this.</p>
<p>WEN. Foh! we shall have you turn proud now, grow respectless of your
ancient acquaintance. Why, Butler told us of it, who was the maker of
the match for you.</p>
<p>ILF. A pox of his furtherance! gentlemen, as you are Christians, vex me
no more. That I am married, I confess; a plague of the fates, that
wedding and hanging comes by destiny; but for the riches she has
brought, bear witness how I'll reward her.    [<emphasis>Kicks her</emphasis>.</p>
<p>SIS. Sir!</p>
<p>ILF. Whore, ay, and jade. Witch! Ill-faced, stinking-breath,
crooked-nose, worse than the devil—and a plague on thee that ever
I saw thee!</p>
<p>BAR. A comedy, a comedy!</p>
<p>WEN. What's the meaning of all this? is this the masque after thy
marriage!</p>
<p>ILF. O gentlemen, I am undone, I am undone, for I am married! I,
that could not abide a woman, but to make her a whore, hated all
she-creatures, fair and poor; swore I would never marry but to one
that was rich, and to be thus coney-catched! Who do you think this
is, gentlemen?</p>
<p>WEN. Why, your wife; who should it be else?</p>
<p>ILF. That's my misfortune; that marrying her in hope she was rich,
she proves to be the beggarly sister to the more beggarly Scarborow.</p>
<p>BAR. How?</p>
<p>WEN. Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>ILF. Ay, you may laugh, but she shall cry as well as I for't.</p>
<p>BAR. Nay, do not weep.</p>
<p>WEN. He does but counterfeit now to delude us. He has all her portion
of land, coin, plate, jewels, and now dissembles thus, lest we should
borrow some money of him.</p>
<p>ILF. And you be kind, gentlemen, lend me some; for, having paid the
priest, I have not so much left in the world as will hire me a horse to
carry me away from her.</p>
<p>BAR. But art thou thus gulled, i'faith?</p>
<p>ILF. Are you sure you have eyes in your head?</p>
<p>WEN. Why, then, [it is] by her brother's setting on, in my conscience;
who knowing thee now to have somewhat to take to by the death of thy
father, and that he hath spent her portion and his own possessions,
hath laid this plot for thee to marry her, and so he to be rid of her
himself.</p>
<p>ILF. Nay, that's without question; but I'll be revenged of 'em both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For you, minx:—nay, 'sfoot, give 'em me, or I'll kick else.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>ILF. Sweet with a pox! you stink in my nose, give me your jewels: nay,
bracelets too.</p>
<p>SIS. O me most miserable!</p>
<p>ILF. Out of my sight, ay, and out of my doors: for now what's within</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

this house is mine; and for your brother,</p>

He made this match in hope to do you good,</p>

And I wear this, the[417] which shall draw his blood.</p>

<p>THOM. Vengeance, I played the thief for the money that bought 'em.</p>
<p>SIS. Left me distressed, and thrust me forth o' doors.</p>
<p>THOM. Damnation on him! I will hear no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But for his wrong revenge me on my brother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Degenerate, and was the curse of all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He spent our portion, and I'll see his fall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN. O, but, brother—</p>
<p>THOM. Persuade me not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All hopes are shipwreck'd, misery comes on,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The comfort we did look from him is frustrate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All means, all maintenance, but grief is gone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all shall end by his destruction.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN. I'll follow, and prevent what in this heat may happen:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His want makes sharp his sword; too great's the ill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If that one brother should another kill.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. And what will you do, mistress?</p>
<p>SIS. I'll sit me down, sigh loud instead of words,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wound myself with grief as they with swords.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for the sustenance that I should eat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll feed on grief, 'tis woe's best-relish'd meat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. Good heart, I pity you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You shall not be so cruel to yourself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have the poor serving-man's allowance:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Twelve pence a day, to buy me sustenance;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One meal a day I'll eat, the t'other fast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To give your wants relief. And, mistress,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be this some comfort to your miseries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll have thin cheeks, ere you shall have wet eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                         [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SCARBOROW.</p>
<p>SCAR. What is a prodigal? Faith, like a brush,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That wears himself to furbish[418] others' clothes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, having worn his heart even to the stump,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He's thrown away like a deformed lump.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, such am I: I have spent all the wealth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My ancestors did purchase, made others brave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In shape and riches, and myself a knave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For though my wealth rais'd some to paint their door,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis shut against me saying I am but poor:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, even the greatest arm, whose hand hath grac'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My presence to the eye of majesty, shrinks back,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His fingers clutch, and like to lead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They are heavy to raise up my state, being dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By which I find spendthrifts (and such am I)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like strumpets flourish, but are foul within,</p>

<p>

And they (like snakes) know when to cast their skin.</p>

<p>THOM. Turn, draw, and die; I come to kill thee.</p>
<p>SCAR. What's he that speaks like sickness? O, is't you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sleep still, you cannot move me: fare you well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Think not my fury slakes so, or my blood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can cool itself to temper by refusal:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Turn, or thou diest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Away.</p>
<p>THOM. I do not wish to kill thee like a slave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That taps men in their cups, and broach[es] their hearts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ere with a warning-piece they have wak'd their ears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not like to powder shoot thee down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To a flat grave, ere thou hast thought to frown:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am no coward, but in manly terms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fairest oppositions vow to kill thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. From whence proceeds this heat?</p>
<p>THOM. From sparkles bred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By thee, that like a villain—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Ha!</p>
<p>THOM. I'll hollow it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In thine ears, till thy soul quake to hear it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That like a villain hast undone thy brothers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Would thou wert not so near me! yet, farewell.</p>
<p>THOM. By Nature and her laws make[419] us akin—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As near as are these hands, or sin to sin—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Draw and defend thyself, or I'll forget</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou art a man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Would thou wert not my brother!</p>
<p>THOM. I disclaim thee[420].</p>
<p>SCAR. Are we not offspring of one parent, wretch?</p>
<p>THOM. I do forget it; pardon me the dead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I should deny the pains you bid for me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My blood grows hot for vengeance, thou hast spent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My life's revenues, that our parents purchas'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. O, do not rack me with remembrance on't.</p>
<p>THOM. Thou hast made my life a beggar in this world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will make thee bankrupt of thy breath:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou hast been so bad, the best that I can give[421].</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou art a devil: not with men to live.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Then take a devil's payment</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Here they make a pass one upon another, when at Scarborow's
    back come in</emphasis> ILFORD, WENTLOE, <emphasis>and</emphasis> BARTLEY.</p>
<p>ILF. He's here; draw, gentlemen.</p>
<p>WEN., BART. Die, Scarborow.</p>
<p>SCAR. Girt round with death!</p>
<p>THOM. How, set upon by three! 'Sfoot, fear not, brother; you cowards,
three to one! slaves, worse than fencers that wear long weapons. You
shall be fought withal, you shall be fought withal.</p>
<p>    [<emphasis>Here the brothers join, drive the rest out, and return</emphasis>.</p>
<p>SCAR. Brother, I thank you, for you now have been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A patron of my life. Forget the sin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I pray you, which my loose and wasteful hours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath made against your fortunes; I repent 'em,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wish I could new-joint and strength your hopes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though with indifferent ruin of mine own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have a many sins, the thought of which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like finest[422] needles prick me to the soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But find your wrongs to have the sharpest point.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If penitence your losses might repair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You should be rich in wealth, and I in care.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. I do believe you, sir: but I must tell you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Evils the which are 'gainst another done,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Repentance makes no satisfaction</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him that feels the smart. Our father, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Left in your trust my portion: you have spent it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And suffered me (whilst you in riot's house—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A drunken tavern—spill'd my maintenance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps upon the ground with o'erflown cups;)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like birds in hardest winter half-starv'd, to fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pick up any food, lest I should die.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. I pr'ythee, let us be at peace together.</p>
<p>THOM. At peace for what? For spending my inheritance?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By yonder sun that every soul has life by,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As sure as thou hast life, I'll fight with thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. I'll not be mov'd unto't.</p>
<p>THOM. I'll kill thee then, wert thou now clasp'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within thy mother, wife, or children's arms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Would'st, homicide? art so degenerate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then let my blood grow hot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. For it shall cool.</p>
<p>SCAR. To kill rather than be kill'd is manhood's rule.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> JOHN SCARBOROW.</p>
<p>JOHN. Stay, let not your wraths meet.</p>
<p>THOM. Heart! what mak'st thou here?</p>
<p>JOHN. Say, who are you, or you? are you not one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That scarce can make a fit distinction</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betwixt each other? Are you not brothers?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. I renounce him.</p>
<p>SCAR. Shalt not need.</p>
<p>THOM. Give way.</p>
<p>SCAR. Have at thee!</p>
<p>JOHN. Who stirs? which of you both hath strength within his arm</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To wound his own breast? who's so desperate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To damn himself by killing of himself?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are you not both one flesh?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Heart! give me way.</p>
<p>SCAR. Be not a bar betwixt us, or by my sword</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll[423] mete thy grave out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN. O, do: for God's sake, do;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis happy death, if I may die, and you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not murder one another. O, do but hearken:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When do the sun and moon, born in one frame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Contend, but they breed earthquakes in men's hearts?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When any star prodigiously appears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tells it not fall of kings or fatal years?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then, if brothers fight, what may men think?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sin grows so high, 'tis time the world should sink.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. My heart grows cool again; I wish it not.</p>
<p>THOM. Stop not my fury, or by my life I swear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will reveal the robbery we have done,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And take revenge on thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That hinders me to take revenge on him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN. I yield to that; but ne'er consent to this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall then die, as mine own sin affords,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fall by the law, not by my brothers' swords.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THOM. Then, by that light that guides me here, I vow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll straight to Sir John Harcop, and make known</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We were the two that robb'd him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN. Prythee, do.</p>
<p>THOM. Sin has his shame, and thou shalt have thy due.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                              [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN. Thus have I shown the nature of a brother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though you have proved unnatural to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He's gone in heat to publish out the theft,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which want and your unkindness forc'd us to:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If now I die, that death and public shame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is a corsive to your soul, blot to your name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                      [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. O, 'tis too true, there's not a thought I think,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But must partake thy grief, and drink</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A relish of thy sorrow and misfortune.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With weight of others' tears I am o'erborne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That scarce am Atlas to hold up mine own,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all too good for me. A happy creature</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In my cradle, and I have made myself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The common curse of mankind by my life;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Undone my brothers, made them thieves for bread,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And begot pretty children to live beggars.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O conscience, how thou art stung to think upon't!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My brothers unto shame must yield their blood:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My babes at others' stirrups beg their food,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or else turn thieves too, and be chok'd for it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Die a dog's death, be perch'd upon a tree;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hang'd betwixt heaven and earth, as fit for neither.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The curse of heaven that's due to reprobates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Descends upon my brothers and my children,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I am parent to it—ay, I am parent to it.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> BUTLER.</p>
<p>BUT. Where are you, sir?</p>
<p>SCAR. Why star'st thou, what's thy haste?</p>
<p>BUT. Here's fellows swarm like flies to speak with you.</p>
<p>SCAR. What are they?</p>
<p>BUT. Snakes, I think, sir; for they come with stings in their mouths,
and their tongues are turn'd to teeth too: they claw villainously, they
have ate up your honest name and honourable reputation by railing
against you: and now they come to devour your possessions.</p>
<p>SCAR. In plainer evargy,[424] what are they? speak.</p>
<p>BUT. Mantichoras,[425] monstrous beasts, enemies to mankind, that have
double rows of teeth in their mouths. They are usurers, they come
yawning for money, and the sheriff with them is come to serve an extent
upon your land, and then seize on your body by force of execution: they
have begirt the house round.</p>
<p>SCAR. So that the roof our ancestors did build</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For their sons' comfort, and their wives for charity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I dare not to look out at.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. Besides, sir, here's your poor children—</p>
<p>SCAR. Poor children they are indeed.</p>
<p>BUT. Come with fire and water, tears in their eyes and burning grief in
their hearts, and desire to speak with you.</p>
<p>SCAR. Heap sorrow upon sorrow! tell me, are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My brothers gone to execution</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For what I did? for every heinous sin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sits on his soul, by whom it did begin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so did theirs by me. Tell me withal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My children carry moisture in their eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose speaking drops say, father, thus must we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ask our relief, or die with infamy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For you have made us beggars. Yet when thy tale has kill'd me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To give my passage comfort from this stage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Say all was done by enforc'd marriage:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My grave will then be welcome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. What shall we do, sir?</p>
<p>SCAR. Do as the devil does, hate (panther-like) mankind![426]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet I lie; for devils sinners love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When men hate men, though good like some above.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> SCARBOROW'S <emphasis>wife</emphasis> KATHERINE, <emphasis>with two Children</emphasis>.</p>
<p>BUT. Your wife's come in, sir.</p>
<p>SCAR. Thou li'st, I have not a wife. None can be call'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

True man and wife, but those whom heaven install'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Say—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. O my dear husband!</p>
<p>SCAR. You are very welcome. Peace: we'll have compliment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who are you, gentlewoman?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. Sir, your distressed wife, and these your children,</p>
<p>SCAR. Mine! Where, how, begot?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prove me by certain instance that's divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I should call them lawful, or thee mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. Were we not married, sir?</p>
<p>SCAR. No; though we heard the words of ceremony,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But had hands knit, as felons that wear fetters</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forc'd upon them. For tell me, woman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Did e'er my love with sighs entreat thee mine?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Did ever I in willing conference</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Speak words, made half with tears, that I did love thee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or was I ever but glad to see thee, as all lovers are?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No, no, thou know'st I was not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. O me!</p>
<p>BUT. The more's the pity.</p>
<p>SCAR. But when I came to church, I did there stand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As water, whose forc'd breach[427] had drown'd my land.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are you my wife, or these my children?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, 'tis impossible; for like the skies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without the sun's light, so look all your eyes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dark, cloudy, thick, and full of heaviness;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within my country there was hope to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Me and my issue to be like our fathers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upholders of our country all our life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which should have been if I had wed a wife:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As dropping leaves in autumn you look all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I, that should uphold you, like to fall.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

For wife of mine thou art not, and these thy bastards</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom I begot of thee with this unrest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That bastards born are born not to be blest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. On me pour all your wrath, but not on them.</p>
<p>SCAR. On thee and them, for 'tis the end of lust</p>
<empty-line/>

To scourge itself, heaven lingering to be just:</p>

<p>

Harlot!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. Husband!</p>
<p>SCAR. Bastards!</p>
<p>CHIL. Father!</p>
<p>BUT. What heart not pities this?</p>
<p>SCAR. Even in your cradle, you were accurs'd of heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou an adultress in my married arms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And they that made the match, bawds to thy lust:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ay, now you hang the head; shouldst have done so before,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then these had not been bastards, thou a whore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. I can brook't no longer: sir, you do not well in this.</p>
<p>SCAR. Ha, slave!</p>
<p>BUT. 'Tis not the aim of gentry to bring forth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such harsh unrelish'd fruit unto their wines[428],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to their pretty—pretty children by my troth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. How, rascal!</p>
<p>BUT. Sir, I must tell you, your progenitors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two of the which these years were servant to,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had not such mists before their understanding,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus to behave themselves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. And you'll control me, sir!</p>
<p>BUT. Ay, I will.</p>
<p>SCAR. You rogue!</p>
<p>BUT. Ay, 'tis I will tell 'tis ungently done</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus to defame your wife, abuse your children:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wrong them, you wrong yourself; are they not yours?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Pretty—pretty impudence, in faith.</p>
<p>BUT. Her whom you are bound to love, to rail against!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those whom you are bound to keep, to spurn like dogs!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And you were not my master, I would tell you—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. What, slave?    [<emphasis>Draws</emphasis>.</p>
<p>BUT. Put up your bird-spit, tut, I fear it not;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In doing deeds so base, so vile as these,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis but a kna, kna, kna—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Rogue!</p>
<p>BUT. Tut, howsoever, 'tis a dishonest part,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in defence of these I throw off duty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. Good butler.</p>
<p>BUT. Peace, honest mistress, I will say you are wrong'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prove it upon him, even in his blood, his bones,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His guts, his maw, his throat, his entrails.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. You runagate of threescore!</p>
<p>BUT. 'Tis better than a knave of three-and-twenty.</p>
<p>SCAR. Patience be my buckler!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As not to file[429] my hands in villain's blood;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You knave, slave, trencher-groom!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who is your master?</p>
<empty-line/>

And there 'tis for you: know that I scorn</p>

To wear his livery is so worthy born,</p>

And live[s] so base a life; old as I am,</p>

I'll rather be a beggar than your man,</p>

And there's your service for you.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

So, now your champion's gone, minx, thou hadst better</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have gone quick unto thy grave—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. O me! that am no cause of it.</p>
<p>SCAR. Than have suborn'd that slave to lift his hand against me.</p>
<p>KATH. O me! what shall become of me?</p>
<p>SCAR. I'll teach you tricks for this: have you a companion?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> BUTLER.</p>
<p>BUT. My heart not suffers me to leave my honest mistress and her pretty
children.</p>
<p>SCAR. I'll mark thee for a strumpet, and thy bastards—</p>
<p>BUT. What will you do to them, sir?</p>
<p>SCAR. The devil in thy shape come back again?</p>
<p>BUT. No, but an honest servant, sir, will take this coat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wear it with this sword to safeguard these,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pity them, and I am woe for you[430], too;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But will not suffer</p>

The husband, viper-like, to prey on them</p>

That love him and have cherish'd him, as these</p>

And they have you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Slave!</p>
<p>BUT. I will outhumour you, [I will]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fight with you and lose my life, ere[431] these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall taste your wrong, whom you are bound to love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Out of my doors, slave!</p>
<p>BUT. I will not, but will stay and wear this coat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And do you service whether you will or no.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll wear this sword, too, and be champion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To fight for her, in spite of any man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. You shall: you shall be my master, sir.</p>
<p>BUT. No, I desire it not,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll pay you duty, even upon my knee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But lose my life, ere these oppress'd I'll see.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Yes, goodman slave, you shall be master,</p>

<p>

Lie with my wife, and get more bastards; do, do, do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>KATH. O me!</p>
<p>SCAR. Turns the world upside down,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That men o'erbear their masters? it does, it does.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For even as Judas sold his master Christ,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Men buy and sell their wives at highest price,</p>
<empty-line/>

What will you give me? what will you give me?</p>

What will you give me?    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

Some means I have left, which I'll relieve you with.</p>

To such great grief, comfort your children.</p>

<p>

That with this endless toil I labour thus:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis but the old time's ancient conscience</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That would do no man hurt, that makes me do't:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If it be sin, that I do pity these,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If it be sin, I have relieved his brothers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have played the thief with them to get their food,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And made a luckless marriage for his sister,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Intended for her good, heaven pardon me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But if so, I am sure they are great sinners,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That made this match, and were unhappy[432] men;</p>

For they caus'd all, and may heaven pardon them.</p>

<p>SIR WIL. His sickness?</p>
<p>BUT. The hell of sickness; troubled in his mind.</p>
<p>SIR WIL. I guess the cause of it,</p>

But cannot now intend to visit him.</p>
<empty-line/>

Great business for my sovereign hastes me hence;</p>

Only this letter from his lord and guardian to him,</p>

At my return I'll see him: so farewell.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

Perplex'd like his, are like land-troubling-winds,</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

We both shall perish for the robbery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. What, is't reveal'd, man?</p>
<p>JOHN. Not yet, good butler: only my brother Thomas,</p>

<p>

In spleen to me that would not suffer him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To kill our elder brother had undone us,</p>

Is riding now to Sir John Harcop straight,</p>

He gives his counsel freely, and the cause</p>

He for his clients pleads goes always with them:</p>

He in my cause shall deal then; and I'll ask him</p>

Whether a cormorant may have stuff'd chests,</p>

And see his brother starve? why, he'll say, ay[433],</p>

How now, master? nay, you are my master;</p>

Is my wife's sheets warm? does she kiss well?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. Good sir.</p>
<p>SCAR. Foh! make't not strange, for in these days,</p>

<p>

There's many men lie in their masters' sheets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so may you in mine, and yet—your business, sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. There's one in civil habit, sir, would speak with you.</p>
<p>SCAR. In civil habit?</p>
<p>BUT. He is of seemly rank, sir, and calls himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By the name of Doctor Baxter of Oxford.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. That man undid me; he did blossoms blow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose fruit proved poison, though 'twas good in show:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With him I'll parley, and disrobe my thoughts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of this wild frenzy that becomes me not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A table, candles, stools, and all things fit,</p>
<empty-line/>

I know he comes to chide me, and I'll hear him:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With our sad conference we will call up tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Teach doctors rules, instruct succeeding years:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Usher him in:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heaven spare a drop from thence, where's bounteous throng:</p>

Give patience to my soul, inflame my tongue.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> DOCTOR.</p>
<p>DOC. Good Master Scarborow.</p>
<p>SCAR. You are most kindly welcome, sooth, ye are.</p>
<p>DOC. I have important business to deliver you.</p>
<p>SCAR. And I have leisure to attend your hearing.</p>
<p>DOC. Sir, you know I married you.</p>
<p>SCAR. I know you did, sir.</p>
<p>DOC. At which you promis'd both to God and men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your life unto your spouse should be like snow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That falls to comfort, not to overthrow:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And love unto your issue should be like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The dew of heaven, that hurts not, though it strike:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When heaven and men did witness and record</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twas an eternal oath, no idle word:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heaven, being pleased therewith, bless'd you with children,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And at heaven's blessings all good men rejoice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So that God's chair and footstool, heaven and earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Made offering at your nuptials as a knot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To mind you of your vow; O, break it not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. 'Tis very true[434].</p>
<p>DOC. Now, sir, from this your oath and band[435],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith's pledge and seal of conscience you have run,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Broken all contracts, and the forfeiture</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Justice hath now in suit against your soul:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Angels are made the jurors, who are witnesses</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto the oath you took, and God himself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Maker of marriage, he that seal'd the deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As a firm lease unto you during life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sits now as judge of your transgression:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The world informs against you with this voice:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If such sins reign, what mortals can rejoice?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. What then ensues to me?</p>
<p>DOC. A heavy doom, whose execution's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now serv'd upon your conscience, that ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You shall feel plagues, whom time shall not dissever;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As in a map your eyes see all your life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bad words, worse deeds, false oaths, and all the injuries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have done unto your soul: then comes your wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Full of woe's drops, and yet as full of pity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who though she speaks not, yet her eyes are swords[436],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That cut your heart-strings: and then your children—</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>SCAR. O, O, O!</strong></p>
<p>DOC. Who, what they cannot say, talk in their looks;</p>

You have made us up, but as misfortune's books,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom other men may read in, when presently,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Task'd by yourself, you are not, like a thief,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Astonied, being accus'd, but scorch'd with grief.</p>

<p>SCAR. Here?</p>
<p>DOC. For which you pine, in conscience burn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wish you had been better, or ne'er born.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. Does all this happen to a wretch like me?</p>
<p>DOC. Both this and worse; your soul eternally</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall live in torment, though the body die.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SCAR. I shall have need of drink then: Butler!</p>
<p>DOC. Nay, all your sins are on your children laid,</p>

For the offences that the father made.</p>

<p>

He's a divine? ay, he's a divine.    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BUT. I see his mind is troubled, and have made bold with duty to read a
letter tending to his good; have made his brothers friends: both which
I will conceal till better temper. He sends me for his wife and children;
shall I fetch them?    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>

And not give torment to contented minds,</p>

To hinder the mishap, the which I fear.

In contract to another? and yet you</p>

From wombs unconsecrate, even when their soul</p>

And shrinks to dwell with them, and in my close</p>

Knit hands without free tongues, look red like them</p>

We are in want, and you are the cause of it;</p>

This points at me, y'are shame unto your house:</p>

She's married, but as those that live in hell:</p>

Whereby all eyes are but misfortune's pipe,</p>

Fill'd full of woe by me: this feels the stripe.</p>

Here's your brothers hand in hand, whom I have knit so.</p>

For they know best to mend, that know amiss.</p>

You gave us grief for future happiness.</p>

Read but this letter.</p>

<p>

Was griev'd for't, and for satisfaction</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath given you double of the wealth you had.</p>
<empty-line/>

Your sin was his, the punishment his due.</p>
<empty-line/>

Is heaven so gracious to sinners then?</p>

To give men life, not life-entrapping spies.</p>

In troth I am sorry I have stray'd amiss;</p>

To whom shall I be thankful? all silent?</p>

<p>[2] From the similarity of the names, it seems the author originally
intended to make Young Lusam the son of Old Lusam and brother of
Mistress Arthur, but afterwards changed his intention: in page 13 the
latter calls him a stranger to her, although he is the intimate friend
of her husband.</p>

The phrase occurs again in "Ram Alley," 1611.]</p>

quoted sentences out of Spenser, Constable, and the rest, digested under
a commonplace. [Another edition in 1610. It is a book of no value or
interest.]</p>
<p>[41] [Left blank in the old copy. The ostensible editor of "Belvidere"
was John Bodenham, but he is evidently not the person referred to here.]</p>

<p>[43] [Two of the old copies read <emphasis>swifter</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[44] [Some copies read <emphasis>S.D</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[45] As the works of some of the poets here cited are become obscure, it
may not be unacceptable to the reader to see a few specimens of their
several abilities. Constable was esteemed the first sonneteer of his
time, and the following sonnet, prefixed to King James I.'s "Poetical
Exercises" was the most admired—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    TO THE KING OF SCOTLAND.</strong></p>
<p>     "When others hooded with blind love do fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Low on the ground with buzzard Cupid's wings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A heavenly love from love of love thee brings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And makes thy Muse to mount above the sky:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Young Muses be not wont to fly so high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Age school'd by time such sober ditties sings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But thy love flies from love of youthful things,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And so the wings of time doth overfly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Thus thou disdain'st all worldly wings as slow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Because thy Muse with angels' wings doth leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Time's wings behind, and Cupid's wings below;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But take thou heed, lest Fame's wings thee deceive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With all thy speed from fame thou canst not flee,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But more thou flees, the more it follows thee."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[46] Lodge was a physician as well as a poet; he was the author of two
plays, and eminent, in his day, for writing elegant odes, pastoral
songs, sonnets, and madrigals. His "Euphues' Golden Legacy" was printed
4to, 1590, from which some suppose Shakespeare took his "As You Like
It." Description of spring by Lodge—</p>
<p>    "The earth late choak'd with showers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Is now array'd in green,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her bosom springs with flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The air dissolves her teen;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The woods are deck'd with leaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And trees are clothed gay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Flora, crown'd with sheaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With oaken boughs doth play;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The birds upon the trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Do sing with pleasant voices,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And chant, in their degrees,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Their loves and lucky choices."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[47] Watson was contemporary with, and imitator of, Sir Philip Sydney,
with Daniel, Lodge, Constable, and others, in the pastoral strain of
sonnets, &amp;c. Watson thus describes a beautiful woman—</p>
<p>    "Her yellow locks exceed the beaten gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her sparkling eyes in heav'n a place deserve.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her forehead high and fair, of comely mould;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her words are music all, of silver sound.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her wit so sharp, as like can scarce be found:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Each eyebrow hangs, like Iris in the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her eagle's nose is straight, of stately frame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On either cheek a rose and lily lies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her breath is sweet perfume or holy flame;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her lips more red than any coral stone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her neck more white than aged swans that moan:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her breast transparent is, like crystal rock,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her fingers long, fit for Apollo's lute,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her slipper such, as Momus dare not mock;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her virtues are so great as make me mute:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What other parts she hath I need not say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Whose face alone is cause of my decay."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[48] [This passage is a rather important piece of evidence in favour of
the identity of the poet with the physician.]</p>
<p>[49] [Sir] John Davis [author of "Nosce Teipsum," &amp;c.]</p>
<p>[50] Old copy, <emphasis>sooping</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[51] Lock and Hudson were the Bavius and Maevius of that time. The
latter gives us this description of fear—</p>
<p>    "Fear lendeth wings to aged folk to fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And made them mount to places that were high;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fear made the woful child to wail and weep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For want of speed on foot and hands to creep."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Hudson, however, enjoyed some repute in his time, and is known as the
translator from Du Bartas of the "History of Judith," 8vo, 1584. Lock
published in 1597 a volume containing an English version of
"Ecclesiastes" and a series of sonnets.]</p>
<p>[52] John Marston, a bold and nervous writer in Elizabeth's reign: the
work here censured was, no doubt, his "Scourge of Villanie, 3 Books of
Satyrs," 1598.</p>
<p>[53] Marlowe's character is well marked in these lines: he was an
excellent poet, but of abandoned morals, and of the most impious
principles; a complete libertine and an avowed atheist. He lost his life
in a riotous fray; for, detecting his servant with his mistress, he
rushed into the room with a dagger in order to stab him, but the man
warded off the blow by seizing Marlowe's wrist, and turned the dagger
into his own head: he languished some time of the wound he received, and
then died, [in] the year 1593.—<emphasis>A. Wood</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[54] [Omitted in some copies.]</p>
<p>[55] [Omitted in some copies.]</p>
<p>[56] Churchyard wrote Jane Shore's Elegy in "Mirror for Magistrates,"
4to, [1574. It is reprinted, with additions, in his "Challenge," 1593.]</p>
<p>[57] Isaac Walton, in his "Life of Hooker," calls Nash a man of a sharp
wit, and the master of a scoffing, satirical, merry pen. His satirical
vein was chiefly exerted in prose; and he is said to have more
effectually discouraged and nonplussed Penry, the most notorious
anti-prelate, Richard Harvey the astrologer, and their adherents, than
all serious writers who attacked them. That he was no mean poet will
appear from the following description of a beautiful woman—</p>
<p>    "Stars fall to fetch fresh light from her rich eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her bright brow drives the sun to clouds beneath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Her hairs' reflex with red streaks paint the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sweet morn and evening dew falls from her breath."</p>

<p>[91] [Halliwell, in his "Dictionary," <emphasis>v. rheum (s.)</emphasis>, defines it to

<p>[92] Old copy, <emphasis>ravished</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[93] [A play on <emphasis>personage</emphasis> and <emphasis>parsonage</emphasis>, which were formerly
interchangeable terms, as both had originally one signification.]</p>
<p>[94] [Queen Elizabeth was born September 7, 1533; not her birthday,
therefore, but her accession (17th November 1558), at the death of her
sister Mary, is referred to by Immerito and Sir Raderic. Elizabeth died
March 24, 1602-3. Inasmuch as there is this special reference in "The
Return from Parnassus" to the Queen's day, and not to King James's day,
we have a certain evidence that the play was written by or before the
end of 1602-3. See also what may be drawn from the reference to the
siege of Ostend, 1601-4, at the close of act iii. sc. 3 <emphasis>post</emphasis>
—additional evidence for 1602.—<emphasis>Ebsworth</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[95] [Old copy, <emphasis>I tooke of</emphasis>, which seems nonsense.]</p>
<p>[96] [So old copy. Hawkins altered the word unnecessarily to
<emphasis>thatched</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[97] [Bespeaketh. Old copies, <emphasis>rellish</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[98] Old copy, <emphasis>bites a lip</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[99] [So in old copy, but should we not read <emphasis>London?—Ebsworth</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[100] [There are three references to Ostend in this play. The town bore
a siege from 1601 to 1604, when it surrendered by capitulation. The
besieged lost 50,000 men, and the Spaniards still more. The expression,
"He is as glad as if he had taken Ostend," surely proves that this play
was written after the beginning of 1601 and the commencement of the
siege. It does not prove it to have been written after 1604, but, I
think, strongly indicates the contrary.—<emphasis>Ebsworth</emphasis>. Is it not possible
that the passage was introduced into the play when printed, and was not
in the original MS.?]</p>
<p>[101] [So the old copies. Hawkins altered it to <emphasis>delicacies</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[102] [Poor must be pronounced as a dissyllable.]</p>
<p>[103] [From <emphasis>marry</emphasis> to <emphasis>terms</emphasis> is omitted in one of the Oxford copies
and in Dr Ingleby's.]</p>
<p>[104] [Old copy, <emphasis>puppet</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[105] [One of the copies at Oxford, and Dr Ingleby's, read <emphasis>nimphs</emphasis>. Two
others misprint <emphasis>mips</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[106] [Old copy, <emphasis>wail</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[107] Old copy, <emphasis>and</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[108] [Both the Oxford copies read <emphasis>teate</emphasis>.]</p>

<p>[110] [Some of the copies, <emphasis>break</emphasis>.]</p>

<p>[113] [Old copy, <emphasis>high</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[114] [A slight departure from Ovid.]</p>
<p>[115] To <emphasis>come off</emphasis> is equivalent to the modern expression to <emphasis>come
down</emphasis>, to pay sauce, to pay dearly, &amp;c. In this sense Shakespeare uses
the phrase in "Merry Wives of Windsor," act iv. sc. 6. The host says,
"They [the Germans] shall have my horses, but I'll make them pay, I'll
sauce them. They have had my house a week at command; I have turned away
my other guests. They must come off; I'll sauce them." An eminent critic
says to <emphasis>come off</emphasis> is to go scot-free; and this not suiting the context,
he bids us read, they must <emphasis>compt off</emphasis>, i.e., clear their reckoning.</p>
<p>[116] Old copy, <emphasis>Craboun</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[117] [Talons.]</p>
<p>[118] <emphasis>Gramercy</emphasis>: great thanks, <emphasis>grand merci</emphasis>; or I thank ye, <emphasis>Je vous
remercie</emphasis>. In this sense it is constantly used by our first writers. A
very great critic pronounces it an obsolete expression of surprise,
contracted from <emphasis>grant me mercy</emphasis>; and cites a passage in "Titus
Andronicus" to illustrate his sense of it; but, it is presumed, that
passage, when properly pointed, confirms the original acceptation—</p>
<p>    CHIRON. Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He hath some message to deliver us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    AARON. Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.</p>
<p>    BOY. My lords, with all the humbleness I may,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I greet your honours from Andronicus—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And pray the Roman gods confound you both.     [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.</p>

<p>A pun upon the word <emphasis>cue</emphasis>, which is a hint to the actor to proceed in

farthing in college buttery-books. To <emphasis>size</emphasis> means to <emphasis>battle</emphasis>, or to be

<p>[182] Winstanley has asserted that Oliver Cromwell performed the part of
Tactus at Cambridge: and some who have written the life of that great
man have fixed upon this speech as what first gave him ideas of
sovereignty. The notion is too vague to be depended upon, and too
ridiculous either to establish or refute. It may, however, not be
unnecessary to mention that Cromwell was born in 1599, and the first
edition of this play [was printed in 1607, and the play itself written
much earlier]. If, therefore, the Protector ever did represent this
character, it is more probable to have been at Huntingdon School.</p>

<p>[219] A busk-point was, I believe, the lace of a lady's stays. Minsheu
explains a <emphasis>buske</emphasis> to be a part of dress "made of wood or whalebone, a
plated or quilted thing to keepe the body straight." The word, I am
informed, is still in common use, particularly in the country among the
farmers' daughters and servants, for a piece of wood to preserve the
stays from being bent. <emphasis>Points</emphasis> or laces were worn by both sexes, and
are frequently mentioned in our ancient dramatic writers.</p>

<p>[225] "<emphasis>Cassock</emphasis>," says Mr Steevens, "signifies a horseman's loose coat,

<p>[228] This was called "The Clouds," in which piece Socrates was
represented hanging up in a basket in the air, uttering numberless
chimerical absurdities, and blaspheming, as it was then reputed, the
gods of his country. At the performance of this piece Socrates was
present himself; and "notwithstanding," says his biographer, "the gross
abuse that was offered to his character, he did not show the least signs
of resentment or anger; nay, such was the unparalleled good nature of
this godlike man, that some strangers there, being desirous to see the
original of this scenic picture, he rose up in the middle of the
performance, stood all the rest of the time, and showed himself to the
people; by which well-placed confidence in his own merit and innocence,
reminding them of those virtues and wisdom so opposite to the sophist in
the play, his pretended likeness, he detected the false circumstances,
which were obtruded into his character, and obviated the malicious
designs of the poet who, having brought his play a second time upon the
stage, met with the contempt he justly merited for such a composition."

<p>[229] [Old copies, <emphasis>page's tongue</emphasis>; but Mendacio, Lingua's page, is

wrongly, as it should seem, as the same persons remain on the stage, and
the conversation is a sequel to what has gone before.]</p>

be he never so thornie, and fuller of pricles than is any <emphasis>urcheon</emphasis>."</p>
<p>[233] Perhaps, instead of <emphasis>the masks are made so strong</emphasis>, we ought to
read, <emphasis>the mesh is made so strong</emphasis>. It clearly means the <emphasis>mesh of the
net</emphasis>, from what is said afterwards.—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>. [But <emphasis>mask</emphasis>, in
Halliwell's "Dictionary," is said to be used for <emphasis>mesh</emphasis>. What is
intended above is not a <emphasis>net</emphasis>, but a network ladder.]</p>
<p>[234] [<emphasis>Hazard</emphasis>, the plot of a tennis-court.—Halliwell's "Dictionary."]</p>
<p>[235] This is one of the many phrases in these volumes which, being not
understood, was altered without any authority from the ancient copies.
The former editions read <emphasis>odd mouthing</emphasis>; the text, however, is right;
for old, as Mr Steevens observes, was formerly a common augmentative in
colloquial language, and as such is often used by Shakespeare and
others. See notes on the "Second Part of Henry IV." act ii. sc. 4, and
"The Taming of the Shrew," act iii. sc. 2.</p>

<p>[246] A favourite game formerly, and apparently one of the oldest in
use. The manner in which it was played will appear from the following
epigram of Sir John Harington, the translator of Ariosto—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>The Story of Marcus's Life at Primero</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    "Fond Marcus ever at <emphasis>Primero</emphasis> playes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Long winter nights, and as long summer dayes:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And I heard once to idle talke attending</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The story of his times and coins mis-spending</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    At first, he thought himselfe halfe way to heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If in his hand he had but got a sev'n.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His father's death set him so high on flote,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All rests went up upon a sev'n and coate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But while he drawes from these grey coats and gownes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The gamesters from his purse drew all his crownes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And he ne'er ceast to venter all in prime,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Till of his age, quite was consum'd the prime.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then he more warily his rest regards,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And sets with certainties upon the cards,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On sixe and thirtie, or on sev'n and nine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If any set his rest, and saith, and mine:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But seed with this, he either gaines or saves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For either Faustus prime is with three knaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or Marcus never can encounter right,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yet drew two Ases, and for further spight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Had colour for it with a hopeful draught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But not encountred, it avail'd him naught.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Well, sith encountring, he so faire doth misse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He sets not, till he nine and fortie is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And thinking now his rest would sure be doubled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He lost it by the hand, with which sore troubled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He joynes now all his stocke unto his stake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That of his fortune he full proofe may make.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    At last both eldest hand and five and fifty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He thinketh now or never (thrive unthrifty.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now for the greatest rest he hath the push:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But Crassus stopt a club, and so was flush:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And thus what with the stop, and with the packe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Poore Marcus and his rest goes still to wracke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now must he seek new spoile to rest his rest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For here his seeds turne weeds, his rest, unrest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His land, his plate he pawnes, he sels his leases,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To patch, to borrow, and shift he never ceases.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Till at the last two catch-poles him encounter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And by arrest, they beare him to the Counter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now Marcus may set up all rests securely:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For now he's sure to be encountred surely."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Minsheu thus explains <emphasis>Primero</emphasis>:—"<emphasis>Primero and Primavista</emphasis>, two games
at cards. Primum et primum visum, that is, first and first seene,
because he that can show such an order of cards first, winnes the game."

<p>[248] [See "Popular Antiquities of Great Britain," ii. 318-19.] So in
Dekker's "Belman's Nights-walke," it is alluded to:—"The set at <emphasis>Maw</emphasis>
being plaid out."</p>
<p>Henslowe in his Diary mentions a play under the title of "The Maw,"
which probably had reference to the game at cards so called. It was
acted on the 14th December 1594. He also names a play entitled "The
Macke," under date of Feb. 21, 1594-5; but it is doubtful if they were
not the same.—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[249] In the old editions this is given as a part of what is said by
Anamnestes.—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>.</p>

<p>[252] <emphasis>Latten</emphasis>, as explained by Dr Johnson, is "Brass; a mixture of
Copper and Caliminaris stone." Mr Theobald, from Monsieur Dacier, says,
"C'est une espece de cuivre de montagne, comme son nom mesme le
temoigne; c'est ce que nous appellons au jourd'huy du <emphasis>leton</emphasis>. It is a
sort of mountain copper, as its very name imports, and which we at this
time of day call <emphasis>latten</emphasis>." See Mr Theobald's note on "The Merry Wives
of Windsor," act i. sc. 1.</p>
<p>Among the Harleian MSS. is a tract, No. 6395, entitled "Merry Passages
and Jeasts," written in the seventeenth century, [printed by Thoms in
"Anecdotes and Traditions," 1839,] in which is the following story of
Shakespeare, which seems entitled to as much credit as any of the
anecdotes which now pass current about him: "Shake-speare was god-father
to one of Ben Jonson's children, and after the christning, being in a
deepe study, Jonson came to cheere him up, and ask't him why he was so
melancholy? No, faith, Ben (sayes he) not I, but I have been considering
a great while, what should be the fittest gift for me to bestow upon my
god-child, and I have resolv'd at last; I pr'y thee what, says he? I
faith, Ben, Ile e'en give him a douzen good <emphasis>Lattin</emphasis> spoones, and thou
shall translate them."</p>
<p>[253] <emphasis>Deft</emphasis> is handy, dexterous. So in "Macbeth," act iv. sc. 1—</p>

observes in his edition of "Beaumont and Fletcher," that this ballad is
mentioned again in "The Knight of the Burning Pestle," and likewise in a
comedy by John Tatham, 1660, called "The Rump, or Mirrour of the Times,"
wherein a Frenchman is introduced at the bonfires made for the burning
of the Rump, and catching hold of Priscilla, will oblige her to dance,
and orders the music to play <emphasis>Fortune my foe</emphasis>. Again, in "Tom Essence,"
1677, p. 37.</p>
<p>[270] A dance. Sir John Davies, in his poem called "Orchestra," 1596,
stanza 70, thus describes it—</p>
<p>    "Yet is there one, the most delightfull kind,</p>

<p>[271] "Or, as it is oftener called, <emphasis>passa mezzo</emphasis>, from <emphasis>passer</emphasis> to walk,
and <emphasis>mezzo</emphasis> the middle or half; a slow dance, little differing from the
action of walking. As a Galliard consists of five paces or bars in the
first strain, and is therefore called a Cinque pace; the <emphasis>passa mezzo</emphasis>,
which is a diminutive of the Galliard, is just half that number, and
from that peculiarity takes its name."—Sir John Hawkins's "History of
Music," iv. 386. [Compare Dyce's second edition of Shakespeare, iii.
412.]</p>
<p>[272] i.e., St Leger's round. "Sellinger's round was an old country
dance, and was not quite out of knowledge in the last century. Morley
mentions it in his Introduction, p. 118, and Taylor the Water Poet, in
his tract, entitled, 'The World runs on Wheels;' and it is printed in a
'Collection of Country Dances,' published by John Playford in
1679."—Sir John Hawkins's "History of Music," iii. 288, where the notes

<p>[288] The custom of censing or dispersing fragrant scents seems formerly
to have been not uncommon. See Ben Jonson's "Every Man out of his

<p>[289] <emphasis>Pomanders</emphasis> were balls of perfume formerly worn by the higher
ranks of people. Dr Gray, in his "Notes on Shakespeare," vol. i. p. 269,
says "that a <emphasis>pomander</emphasis> was a little ball made of perfumes, and worn in
the pocket, or about the neck, to prevent infection in times of plague."
From the above receipt, it appears they were moulded in different
shapes, and not wholly confined to that of balls; and the like direction
is given in another receipt for making <emphasis>pomanders</emphasis> printed in Markham's
"English Housewife," p. 151, edit. 1631.</p>

gull, a sot, a ninnie, a meacock. Ben Jonson uses the word in "The
Poetaster," act iii. sc. 4: "Come, we must have you turn fiddler again,
slave; get a base violin at your back, and march in a tawny coat, with
one sleeve, to Goose-fair; then you'll know us, you'll see us then, you

<p>[315] <emphasis>Bawsin</emphasis>, in some counties, signifies a <emphasis>badger</emphasis>. I think I have

<p>[326] Catalogue of the library of John Hutton. Sold at Essex House,
1764, p. 121. The whole title of the tract, which Mr Reed does not
appear to have seen, as he quotes it only from a sale catalogue, is as
follows:—"Three Miseries of Barbary: Plague, Famine, Ciuill warre. With
a relation of the death of Mahamet the late Emperour: and a briefe
report of the now present Wars betweene the three Brothers. Printed by
W.I. for Henry Gosson, and are to be sold in Pater noster rowe, at the
signe of the Sunne." It is without date, and the name of the author,
George Wilkins, is subscribed to a dedication, "To the right worshipfull
the whole Company of Barbary Merchants." The tract is written in an
ambitious style, and the descriptions are often striking; but there is
nothing but the similarity of name to connect it with "The Miseries of
Enforced Marriage."—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[327] [Hazlitt's "Handbook," 1867, p. 656.]</p>
<p>[328] [Not in the old copies.]</p>
<p>[329] "This comedy (as Langbaine improperly calls it) has been a great
part of it revived by Mrs Behn, under the title of 'The Town Fop, or Sir
Timothy Tawdry.'"</p>
<p>[330] These were among the articles of extravagance in which the youth
of the times used to indulge themselves. They are mentioned by Fennor,
in "The Compters Commonwealth," 1617, p. 32: "Thinkes himselfe much
graced (as to be much beholding to them) as to be entertained among
gallants, that were wrapt up in sattin suites, cloakes lined with
velvet, that scorned to weare any other then beaver hats and gold bands,
rich swords and scarfes, silke stockings and gold fringed garters, or
russett bootes and <emphasis>gilt spurres</emphasis>; and so compleate cape ape, that he
almost dares take his corporal oath the worst of them is worth (at
least) a thousand a yeare, when heaven knows the best of them all for a
month, nay, sometimes a yeare together, have their pockets worse
furnished then Chandelors boxes, that have nothing but twopences, pence,
halfe pence, and leaden tokens in them."</p>
<p>[331] The following quotation from the "Perfuming of Tobacco, and the
great abuse committed in it," 1611, shows, in opposition to Mr
Gilchrist's conjecture, that <emphasis>drinking</emphasis> tobacco did not mean extracting
the juice by chewing it, but refers to drawing and drinking the smoke of
it. "The smoke of tobacco (the which Dodoneus called rightly Henbane of
Peru) <emphasis>drunke</emphasis> and <emphasis>drawen</emphasis>, by a pipe, filleth the membranes
(<emphasis>meninges</emphasis>) of the braine, and astonisheth and filleth many persons
with such joy and pleasure, and sweet losse of senses, that they can by
no means be without it." In fact, to <emphasis>drink</emphasis> tobacco was only another
term for smoking it.—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[332] Alluding to the colour of the habits of servants.</p>
<p>[333] i.e., Owns. See note to "Cornelia" [v. 232].</p>
<p>[334] The omission of this stage direction, which is found in the old

<p>[341] [Edits., <emphasis>his</emphasis>. Even the passage is now obscure and

<p>[342] [Separate.] This is obviously quoted from the marriage ceremony:
as Mr Todd has shown, the Dissenters in 1661 did not understand <emphasis>depart</emphasis>
in the sense of <emphasis>separate</emphasis>, which led to the alteration of the Liturgy,
"till death us <emphasis>do part</emphasis>." In the "Salisbury Manual" of 1555 it stands
thus: "I, N, take thee, M, to my wedded wyf, to have and to holde fro
this day forwarde, for better for wors, for richer for poorer, in
sicknesse and in hele, tyl deth us <emphasis>departe</emphasis>."—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>.</p>
<p>So in "Every Woman in her Humour," 1609: "And the little God of love, he
shall be her captain: sheele sewe under him <emphasis>'till death us depart</emphasis>, and
thereto I plight thee my troth." And Heywood, in his "Wise Woman of
Hogsdon," iii., makes Chastley also quote from the marriage ceremony:

<p>[363] In a similar vein of humour, but much more exquisite, Addison,
speaking of Sir Roger de Coverley, says, "He told me some time since
that, upon his courting the perverse widow, he had disposed of an
hundred acres in a diamond ring, which he would have presented her with,
had she thought fit to accept it; and that upon her wedding-day she
should have carried on her head fifty of the tallest oaks upon his
estate. He further informed me that he would have given her a coalpit to
keep her in clean linen; that he would have allowed her the profits of a
windmill for her fans, and have presented her once in three years with
the shearing of his sheep for her under-petticoats."—<emphasis>Spectator</emphasis>, No.

<p>In Wilson's "Discourse uppon Usurye," 1572, the subsequent passage

<p>[383] "<emphasis>Red lattice</emphasis> at the doors and windows were formerly the external
denotements of an alehouse; hence the present <emphasis>chequers</emphasis>." Mr Steevens
observes (note to "Merry Wives of Windsor," act ii. sc. 2) that "perhaps
the reader will express some surprise when he is told that shops with
the sign of the <emphasis>chequers</emphasis>, were common among the Romans. See a view of
the left-hand street of Pompeii (No. 9) presented by Sir William
Hamilton (together with several others equally curious) to the Antiquary
Society." [Compare "Popular Antiquities of Great Britain," ii. 277-8.]
Marston, in the "First Part of Antonio and Mellida," act v., makes
Balurdo say: "No, I am not Sir Jeffrey Balurdo: I am not as well known
by my wit as an <emphasis>alehouse</emphasis> by a <emphasis>red lattice</emphasis>."</p>

<p>[386] The first edit, reads, <emphasis>and any man else and he</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[387] Three different departments of a prison, in which debtors were
confined according to their ability or incapacity to pay for their
accommodations: all three are pretty accurately described by Fennor in
"The Compter's Commonwealth," 1617.</p>
<p>[388] [Edits., <emphasis>importance</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[389] <emphasis>Sack</emphasis> with <emphasis>sugar</emphasis> was formerly a favourite liquor. Although it
is mentioned very often in contemporary writers, it is difficult to
collect from any circumstances what the kind of wine then called <emphasis>sack</emphasis>
was understood to be. In the Second Part of "Henry IV.," act iv. sc. 3,
Falstaff speaks of <emphasis>sherris sack</emphasis>; and Dr Johnson supposes the fat
knight's admired potation was what we now call <emphasis>sherry</emphasis>, which he says
is drunk with sugar. This last assertion is contradicted by Mr Steevens,
who with more truth asserts that <emphasis>sherry</emphasis> is at this time never drunk
with <emphasis>sugar</emphasis>, whereas <emphasis>Rhenish</emphasis> frequently is. Dr Warburton seems to be
of opinion that the sweet wine still denominated <emphasis>sack</emphasis> was that so
often mentioned by Falstaff, and the great fondness of the English
nation for <emphasis>sugar</emphasis> rather countenances that idea. Hentzner, p. 88, edit.
1757, speaking of the manners of the English, says, <emphasis>In potu copiosae
immittunt saccarum</emphasis>—they put a great deal of sugar in their drink; and
Moryson, in his "Itinerary," 1617, p. 155, mentioning the Scots,
observes, "They drinke pure wines, not with <emphasis>sugar, as the English</emphasis>;"
again, p. 152, "But gentlemen garrawse onely in wine, with which many
mixe <emphasis>sugar</emphasis>, which I never observed in any other place or kingdome to
be used for that purpose: and because the taste of the English is thus
delighted with sweetnesse, the wines in tavernes (for I speak not of
merchants or gentlemen's cellars) are commonly mixed at the filling
thereof, to make them pleasant." <emphasis>Sack and sugar</emphasis> are mentioned in "Jack
Drum's Entertainment," sig. G 3; "The Shoemaker's Holiday," sig. E;
"Everie Woman in Her Humour," sig. D 4; and "The Wonderful Yeare," 1603.
It appears, however, from the following passage in "The English
Housewife," by Gervase Markham, 1631, p. 162, that there were various
species of <emphasis>sack</emphasis>: "Your best <emphasis>sacke</emphasis> are of Seres in Spaine, your
smaller of Galicia and Portugall: your strong <emphasis>sackes</emphasis> are of the
islands of the Canaries and of Malligo, and your Muscadine and Malmseys
are of many parts of Italy, Greece, and some speciall islands." [But see
an elaborate note on sack (vin sec) in Dyce's "Shakespeare Glossary,"
in <emphasis>v</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[390] [Edit., <emphasis>courses</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[391] [A room in the inn so called.]</p>
<p>[392] The second edition has it, <emphasis>my master hopes to ride a cockhorse by

<p>[406] <emphasis>Heir</emphasis> and <emphasis>heiress</emphasis> were formerly confounded in the same way as
<emphasis>prince</emphasis> was applied to both male and female. So in Cyril Tourneur's
"Atheist's Tragedy," 1612, we have—</p>
<p>    This Castabella is a wealthy <emphasis>heire</emphasis>."</p>
<p>—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[407] We must here suppose that butler whispers to Ilford the place
where the lady <emphasis>lies</emphasis> or <emphasis>lodges</emphasis>.—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[408] The following extracts from Stubbes's "Anatomie of Abuses," 4to,
1595, p. 57, will show the manners of the English in some particulars
which are alluded to in the course of these volumes: "Other some
(i.e., of the women of England) spend the greatest part of the day <emphasis>in
sitting at the dore</emphasis>, to show their braveries, and to make knowne their
beauties, to beholde the passengers by, to view the coast, to see
fashions, and to acquaint themselves with the bravest fellows; for if
not for these causes, I see no other causes why they <emphasis>should sit at
their dores</emphasis>, from morning till noon (as many do), from noon to night,
thus vainly spending their golden dayes in filthy idleness and sin.
Againe, other some being weary of that exercise, take occasion (about
urgent affaires you must suppose) to walke into the towne, and least
anything might be gathered, but that they goe about serious matters
indeed, they take their baskets in their hands, or under their arms,
under which pretence pretie conceits are practized, and yet may no man
say black is their eye.</p>
<p>"In the field's and suburbes of the cities they have gardens either
paled or walled round about very high, with their harbers and bowers fit
for the purpose. And least they might be espied in these open places,
they have their banquetting-houses with galleries, turrets, and what
not, therein sumptuously erected: wherein they may (and doubtless do)
many of them play the filthy persons. And for that their gardens are
locked, some of them have three or four keys a piece, whereof one they
keep for themselves, the other their paramours have to goe in before
them, least happily they might be perceived, for then were all the sport
dasht. Then to these gardens they repair, when they list, with a basket
and a boy, where they meeting their sweet harts, receive their wished
desires."</p>
<p>[409] See note to "The Parson's Wedding," iii. 3.</p>
<p>[410] [A woman of loose character. Such was its ordinary acceptation,
yet not its invariable one. See Lovelace's Poems, by Hazlitt, 1864, pp.
xl., xli., and 133, notes.] See note to "King Henry IV., Part II.,"
edit. 1778, v. 522.—<emphasis>Steevens</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[411] [Edits., <emphasis>throw</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[412] "Towards the rear of the stage there appears to have been a
balcony or upper stage, the platform of which was probably eight or nine
feet from the ground. I suppose it to have been supported by pillars.
From hence, in many of our old plays, part of the dialogue was spoken;
and in front of it curtains likewise were hung, so as occasionally to
conceal the persons in it from the view of the audience."—Malone's
"History of the Stage." See his edition of "Shakespeare" by Boswell,
iii. 79.</p>

refers to "nature and her laws," mentioned not very intelligibly, in his
preceding speech.—<emphasis>Collier</emphasis>. [The first edit. of 1607 reads rightly
<emphasis>thee</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[421] The grammar and language of this line are alike obscure and
incorrect; but the sense is tolerably clear—"Thou hast been so bad, the
best thing I can say is, &amp;c."</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
<p>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
<p>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE

<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
