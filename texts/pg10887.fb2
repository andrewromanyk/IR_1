<p><strong>SPECIAL INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The great nation which dwelt in the seventh century before our era on the
banks of Tigris and Euphrates flourished in literature as well as in the
plastic arts, and had an alphabet of its own. The Assyrians sometimes
wrote with a sharp reed, for a pen, upon skins, wooden tablets, or papyrus
brought from Egypt. In this case they used cursive letters of a Phoenician
character. But when they wished to preserve their written documents, they
employed clay tablets, and a stylus whose bevelled point made an
impression like a narrow elongated wedge, or arrow-head. By a combination
of these wedges, letters and words were formed by the skilled and
practised scribe, who would thus rapidly turn off a vast amount of "copy."
All works of history, poetry, and law were thus written in the cuneiform
or old Chaldean characters, and on a substance which could withstand the
ravages of time, fire, or water. Hence we have authentic monuments of
Assyrian literature in their original form, unglossed, unaltered, and
ungarbled, and in this respect Chaldean records are actually superior to
those of the Greeks, the Hebrews, or the Romans.</p>
<p>The literature of the Chaldeans is very varied in its forms. The hymns to
the gods form an important department, and were doubtless employed in
public worship. They are by no means lacking in sublimity of expression,
and while quite unmetrical they are proportioned and emphasized, like
Hebrew poetry, by means of parallelism. In other respects they resemble
the productions of Jewish psalmists, and yet they date as far back as the
third millennium before Christ. They seem to have been transcribed in the
shape in which we at present have them in the reign of Assurbanipal, who
was a great patron of letters, and in whose reign libraries were formed in
the principal cities. The Assyrian renaissance of the seventeenth century
B.C. witnessed great activity among scribes and book collectors: modern
scholars are deeply indebted to this golden age of letters in Babylonia
for many precious and imperishable monuments. It is, however, only within
recent years that these works of hoar antiquity have passed from the
secluded cell of the specialist and have come within reach of the general
reader, or even of the student of literature. For many centuries the
cuneiform writing was literally a dead letter to the learned world. The
clue to the understanding of this alphabet was originally discovered in
1850 by Colonel Rawlinson, and described by him in a paper read before the
Royal Society. Hence the knowledge of Assyrian literature is, so far as
Europe is concerned, scarcely more than half a century old.</p>
<p>Among the most valuable of historic records to be found among the
monuments of any nation are inscriptions, set up on public buildings, in
palaces, and in temples. The Greek and Latin inscriptions discovered at
various points on the shores of the Mediterranean have been of priceless
value in determining certain questions of philology, as well as in
throwing new light on the events of history. Many secrets of language have
been revealed, many perplexities of history disentangled, by the words
engraven on stone or metal, which the scholar discovers amid the dust of
ruined temples, or on the <emphasis>cippus</emphasis> of a tomb. The form of one Greek
letter, perhaps even its existence, would never have been guessed but for
its discovery in an inscription. If inscriptions are of the highest
critical importance and historic interest, in languages which are
represented by a voluminous and familiar literature, how much more
precious must they be when they record what happened in the remotest dawn
of history, surviving among the ruins of a vast empire whose people have
vanished from the face of the earth?</p>
<p>Hence the cuneiform inscriptions are of the utmost interest and value, and
present the greatest possible attractions to the curious and intelligent
reader. They record the deeds and conquests of mighty kings, the Napoleons
and Hannibals of primeval time. They throw a vivid light on the splendid
sculptures of Nineveh; they give a new interest to the pictures and
carvings that describe the building of cities, the marching to war, the
battle, by sea and land, of great monarchs whose horse and foot were as
multitudinous as the locusts that in Eastern literature are compared to
them. Lovers of the Bible will find in the Assyrian inscriptions many
confirmations of Scripture history, as well as many parallels to the
account of the primitive world in Genesis, and none can give even a
cursory glance at these famous remains without feeling his mental horizon
widened. We are carried by this writing on the walls of Assyrian towns far
beyond the little world of the recent centuries; we pass, as almost
modern, the day when Julius Cæsar struggled in the surf of Kent against
the painted savages of Britain. Nay, the birth of Romulus and Remus is a
recent event in comparison with records of incidents in Assyrian national
life, which occurred not only before Moses lay cradled on the waters of an
Egyptian canal, but before Egypt had a single temple or pyramid, three
millenniums before the very dawn of history in the valley of the Nile.</p>
<p>But the interest of Assyrian Literature is not confined to hymns, or even</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

to inscriptions. A nameless poet has left in the imperishable tablets of a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Babylonian library an epic poem of great power and beauty. This is the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Epic of Izdubar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At Dur-Sargina, the city where stood the palace of Assyrian monarchs three
thousand years ago, were two gigantic human figures, standing between the
winged bulls, carved in high relief, at the entrance of the royal
residence. These human figures are exactly alike, and represent the same
personage—a Colossus with swelling thews, and dressed in a robe of
dignity. He strangles a lion by pressing it with brawny arm against his
side, as if it were no more than a cat. This figure is that of Izdubar, or
Gisdubar, the great central character of Assyrian poetry and sculpture,
the theme of minstrels, the typical hero of his land, the favored of the
gods. What is called the Epic of Izdubar relates the exploits of this
hero, who was born the son of a king in Ourouk of Chaldea. His father was
dethroned by the Elamites, and Izdubar was driven into the wilderness and
became a mighty hunter. In the half-peopled earth, so lately created, wild
beasts had multiplied and threatened the extermination of mankind. The
hunter found himself at war with monsters more formidable than even the
lion or the wild bull. There were half-human scorpions, bulls with the
head of man, fierce satyrs and winged griffins. Deadly war did Izdubar
wage with them, till as his period of exile drew near to a close he said
to his mother, "I have dreamed a dream; the stars rained from heaven upon
me; then a creature, fierce-faced and taloned like a lion, rose up against
me, and I smote and slew him."</p>
<p>The dream was long in being fulfilled, but at last Izdubar was told of a
monstrous jinn, whose name was Heabani; his head was human but horned; and
he had the legs and tail of a bull, yet was he wisest of all upon earth.
Enticing him from his cave by sending two fair women to the entrance,
Izdubar took him captive and led him to Ourouk, where the jinn married one
of the women whose charms had allured him, and became henceforth the
well-loved servant of Izdubar. Then Izdubar slew the Elamite who had
dethroned his father, and put the royal diadem on his own head. And behold
the goddess Ishtar (Ashtaroth) cast her eyes upon the hero and wished to
be his wife, but he rejected her with scorn, reminding her of the fate of
Tammuz, and of Alala the Eagle, and of the shepherd Taboulon—all her
husbands, and all dead before their time. Thus, as the wrath of Juno
pursued Paris, so the hatred of this slighted goddess attends Izdubar
through many adventures. The last plague that torments him is leprosy, of
which he is to be cured by Khasisadra, son of Oubaratonton, last of the
ten primeval kings of Chaldea. Khasisadra, while still living, had been
transported to Paradise, where he yet abides. Here he is found by Izdubar,
who listens to his account of the Deluge, and learns from him the remedy
for his disease. The afflicted hero is destined, after being cured, to
pass, without death, into the company of the gods, and there to enjoy
immortality. With this promise the work concludes.</p>
<p>The great poem of Izdubar has but recently been known to European
scholars, having been discovered in 1871 by the eminent Assyriologist, Mr.
George Smith. It was probably written about 2000 B.C., though the extant
edition, which came from the library of King Assurbanipal in the palace at
Dur-Sargina, must bear the date of 600 B.C. The hero is supposed to be a
solar personification, and the epic is interesting to modern writers not
only on account of its description of the Deluge, but also for the pomp
and dignity of its style, and for its noble delineation of heroic
character.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>O love, my queen and goddess, come to me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My soul shall never cease to worship thee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come pillow here thy head upon my breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And whisper in my lyre thy softest, best.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweetest melodies of bright <emphasis>Sami</emphasis>,[1]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our Happy Fields[2] above dear <emphasis>Subartu</emphasis>;[3]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come nestle closely with those lips of love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And balmy breath, and I with thee shall rove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through <emphasis>Sari</emphasis>[4] past ere life on earth was known,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Time unconscious sped not, nor had flown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou art our all in this impassioned life:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How sweetly comes thy presence ending strife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou god of peace and Heaven's undying joy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, hast thou ever left one pain or cloy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon this beauteous world to us so dear?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all mankind thou art their goddess here.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To thee we sing, our holiest, fairest god,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The One who in that awful chaos trod</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And woke the Elements by Law of Love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To teeming worlds in harmony to move.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From chaos thou hast led us by thy hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

[5]Thus spoke to man upon that budding land:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"The Queen of Heaven, of the dawn am I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The goddess of all wide immensity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thee I open wide the golden gate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of happiness, and for thee love create</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To glorify the heavens and fill with joy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The earth, its children with sweet love employ."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou gavest then the noblest melody</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And highest bliss—grand nature's harmony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With love the finest particle is rife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And deftly woven in the woof of life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In throbbing dust or clasping grains of sand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In globes of glistening dew that shining stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On each pure petal, Love's own legacies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of flowering verdure, Earth's sweet panoplies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By love those atoms sip their sweets and pass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To other atoms, join and keep the mass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With mighty forces moving through all space,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tis thus on earth all life has found its place.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through Kisar,[6] Love came formless through the air</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In countless forms behold her everywhere!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, could we hear those whispering roses sweet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Three beauties bending till their petals meet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And blushing, mingling their sweet fragrance there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In language yet unknown to mortal ear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their whisperings of love from morn till night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would teach us tenderly to love the right.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Love, here stay! Let chaos not return!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With hate each atom would its lover spurn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In air above, on land, or in the sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O World, undone and lost that loseth thee!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For love we briefly come, and pass away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For other men and maids; thus bring the day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of love continuous through this glorious life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, hurl away those weapons fierce of strife!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We here a moment, point of time but live,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too short is life for throbbing hearts to grieve.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thrice holy is that form that love hath kissed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And happy is that man with heart thus blessed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, let not curses fall upon that head</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom love hath cradled on the welcome bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of bliss, the bosom of our fairest god,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or hand of love e'er grasp the venging rod.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Oh, come, dear Zir-ri,[7] tune your lyres and lutes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sing of love with chastest, sweetest notes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Accad's goddess Ishtar, Queen of Love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar, with softest measure move;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great Samas'[8] son, of him dear Zir-ri sing!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of him whom goddess Ishtar warmly wooed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of him whose breast with virtue was imbued.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He as a giant towered, lofty grown,</p>
<empty-line/>

<p><strong>THE FALL OF ERECH</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O Moon-god,[1] hear my cry! With thy pure light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, take my spirit through that awful night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That hovers o'er the long-forgotten years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sing Accadia's songs and weep her tears!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twas thus I prayed, when lo! my spirit rose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On fleecy clouds, enwrapt in soft repose;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I beheld beneath me nations glide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In swift succession by, in all their pride:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The earth was filled with cities of mankind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And empires fell beneath a summer wind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The soil and clay walked forth upon the plains</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In forms of life, and every atom gains</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A place in man or breathes in animals;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And flesh and blood and bones become the walls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of palaces and cities, which soon fall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To unknown dust beneath some ancient wall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All this I saw while guided by the stroke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of unseen pinions:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                      Then amid the smoke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That rose o'er burning cities, I beheld</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

White Khar-sak-kur-ra's[2] brow arise that held</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The secrets of the gods—that felt the prore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Khasisadra's ark; I heard the roar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of battling elements, and saw the waves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That tossed above mankind's commingled graves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mighty mountain as some sentinel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stood on the plains alone; and o'er it fell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A halo, bright, divine; its summit crowned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With sunbeams, shining on the earth around</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er the wide expanse of plains;—below</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lay Khar-sak-kal-ama[3] with light aglow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And nestling far away within my view</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stood Erech, Nipur, Marad, Eridu,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Babylon, the tower-city old,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In her own splendor shone like burnished gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! grand Erech in her glorious days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lies at my feet. I see a wondrous maze</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of vistas, groups, and clustering columns round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within, without the palace;—from the ground</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of outer staircases, massive, grand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stretch to the portals where the pillars stand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A thousand carvèd columns reaching high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To silver rafters in an azure sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And palaces and temples round it rise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With lofty turrets glowing to the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And massive walls far spreading o'er the plains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here live and move Accadia's courtly trains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! the <emphasis>pit-u-dal-ti</emphasis>[4] at the gates,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And <emphasis>masari</emphasis>[5] patrol and guard the streets!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yonder comes a <emphasis>kis-ib</emphasis>, nobleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With a young prince; and see! a caravan</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Winds through the gates! With men the streets are filled!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And chariots, a people wise and skilled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In things terrestrial, what science, art,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here reign! With laden ships from every mart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The docks are filled, and foreign fabrics bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From peoples, lands, where many an empire, king,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have lived and passed away, and naught have left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In history or song. Dread Time hath cleft</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Us far apart; their kings and kingdoms, priests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bards are gone, and o'er them sweep the mists</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of darkness backward spreading through all time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their records swept away in every clime.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those alabaster stairs let us ascend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And through this lofty portal we will wend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See! richest Sumir rugs amassed, subdue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tilèd pavement with its varied hue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the turquoise ceiling sprinkled stars</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of gold and silver crescents in bright pairs!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gold-fringed scarlet curtains grace each door,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the inlaid columns reach the floor:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From golden rods extending round the halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bright silken hangings drape the sculptured walls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But part those scarlet hangings at the door</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of yon grand chamber! tread the antique floor!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold the sovereign on her throne of bronze,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While crouching at her feet a lion fawns;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The glittering court with gold and gems ablaze</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With ancient splendor of the glorious days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Accad's sovereignty. Behold the ring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of dancing beauties circling while they sing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With amorous forms in moving melody,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The measure keep to music's harmony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hear! how the music swells from silver lute</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And golden-stringèd lyres and softest flute</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And harps and tinkling cymbals, measured drums,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While a soft echo from the chamber comes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But see! the sovereign lifts her jewelled hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The music ceases at the Queen's command;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! two chiefs in warrior's array,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With golden helmets plumed with colors gay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And golden shields, and silver coats of mail,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Obeisance make to her with faces pale,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prostrate themselves before their sovereign's throne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In silence brief remain with faces prone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till Ellat-gula[6] speaks: "My chiefs, arise!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What word have ye for me? what new surprise?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tur-tau-u,[7] rising, says, "O Dannat[8] Queen!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thine enemy, Khum-baba[9] with Rim-siu[10]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With clanging shields, appears upon the hills,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Elam's host the land of Sumir fills."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Away, ye chiefs! sound loud the <emphasis>nappa-khu</emphasis>![11]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Send to their post each warrior <emphasis>bar-ru</emphasis>!"[12]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gray embattlements rose in the light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That lingered yet from Samas'[13] rays, ere Night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her sable folds had spread across the sky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus Erech stood, where in her infancy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The huts of wandering Accads had been built</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of soil, and rudely roofed by woolly pelt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'erlaid upon the shepherd's worn-out staves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yonder lay their fathers' unmarked graves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their chieftains in those early days oft meet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the mountains where they Samas greet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With their rude sacrifice upon a tree</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

High-raised that their sun-god may shining see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their offering divine; invoking pray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For aid, protection, blessing through the day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath these walls and palaces abode</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The spirit of their country—each man trod</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As if his soul to Erech's weal belonged,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And heeded not the enemy which thronged</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the gates, that now were closed with bars</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of bronze thrice fastened.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                  See the thousand cars</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And chariots arrayed across the plains!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The marching hosts of Elam's armèd trains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The archers, slingers in advance amassed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With black battalions in the centre placed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With chariots before them drawn in line,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bedecked with brightest trappings iridine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While gorgeous plumes of Elam's horses nod</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the awful sign of Elam's god.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On either side the mounted spearsmen far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Extend; and all the enginery of war</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are brought around the walls with fiercest shouts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from behind their shields each archer shoots.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Thus Erech is besieged by her dread foes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she at last must feel Accadia's woes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And feed the vanity of conquerors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who boast o'er victories in all their wars.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great Subartu[14] has fallen by Sutu[15]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Kassi,[16] Goim[17] fell with Lul-lu-bu,[18]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus Khar-sak-kal-a-ma[19] all Eridu[20]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'erran with Larsa's allies; Subartu</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Duran[21] thus was conquered by these sons</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of mighty Shem and strewn was Accad's bones</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Throughout her plains, and mountains, valleys fair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unburied lay in many a wolf's lair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, where is Accad's chieftain Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her mightiest unrivalled prince of war?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The turrets on the battlemented walls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Swarm with skilled bowmen, archers—from them falls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A cloud of wingèd missiles on their foes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who swift reply with shouts and twanging bows;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now amidst the raining death appears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The scaling ladder, lined with glistening spears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But see! the ponderous catapults now crush</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ladder, spearsmen, with their mighty rush</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of rocks and beams, nor in their fury slacked</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As if a toppling wall came down intact</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the maddened mass of men below.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But other ladders rise, and up them flow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tides of armèd spearsmen with their shields;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From others bowmen shoot, and each man wields</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A weapon, never yielding to his foe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For death alone he aims with furious blow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last upon the wall two soldiers spring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A score of spears their corses backward fling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But others take their place, and man to man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And spear to spear, and sword to sword, till ran</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The walls with slippery gore; but Erech's men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are brave and hurl them from their walls again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now the battering-rams with swinging power</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Commence their thunders, shaking every tower;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And miners work beneath the crumbling walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! before her foemen Erech falls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Vain are suspended chains against the blows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of dire assaulting engines.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                            Ho! there goes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The eastern wall with Erech's strongest tower!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And through the breach her furious foemen pour:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wall of steel withstands the onset fierce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But thronging Elam's spears the lines soon pierce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A band of chosen men there fight to die,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before their enemies disdain to fly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>masari</emphasis>[22] within the breach thus died,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with their dying shout the foe defied.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The foes swarm through the breach and o'er the walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Erech in extremity loud calls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the gods for aid, but prays for naught,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While Elam's soldiers, to a frenzy wrought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pursue and slay, and sack the city old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fiendish shouts for blood and yellow gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each man that falls the foe decapitates,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bears the reeking death to Erech's gates.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gates are hidden 'neath the pile of heads</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That climbs above the walls, and outward spreads</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A heap of ghastly plunder bathed in blood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside them calm scribes of the victors stood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And careful note the butcher's name, and check</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The list; and for each head a price they make.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus pitiless the sword of Elam gleams</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the best blood of Erech flows in streams.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Erech's walls some fugitives escape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And others in Euphrates wildly leap,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hide beneath its rushes on the bank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And many 'neath the yellow waters sank.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The harper of the Queen, an agèd man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stands lone upon the bank, while he doth scan</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The horizon with anxious, careworn face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lest ears profane of Elam's hated race</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should hear his strains of mournful melody:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now leaning on his harp in memory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enwrapt, while fitful breezes lift his locks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of snow, he sadly kneels upon the rocks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sighing deeply clasps his hands in woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While the dread past before his mind doth flow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A score and eight of years have slowly passed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since Rim-a-gu, with Elam's host amassed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Kardunia's ancient capital had stormed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The glorious walls and turrets are transformed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To a vast heap of ruins, weird, forlorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Elam's spears gleam through the coming morn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the sad sight his eyes he turns away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His soul breathes through his harp while he doth play</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With bended head his agèd hands thus woke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The woes of Erech with a measured stroke:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    O Erech! dear Erech, my beautiful home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Accadia's pride, O bright land of the bard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Come back to my vision, dear Erech, oh, come!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Fair land of my birth, how thy beauty is marred!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The horsemen of Elam, her spearsmen and bows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

       Thy treasures have ravished, thy towers thrown down,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Accad is fallen, trod down by her foes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Oh, where are thy temples of ancient renown?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Gone are her brave heroes beneath the red tide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Gone are her white vessels that rode o'er the main,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No more on the river her pennon shall ride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Gargan-na is fallen, her people are slain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Wild asses[23] shall gallop across thy grand floors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And wild bulls shall paw them and hurl the dust high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Upon the wild cattle that flee through her doors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And doves shall continue her mournful slave's cry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Oh, where are the gods of our Erech so proud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As flies they are swarming away from her halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The Sedu[24] of Erech are gone as a cloud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As wild fowl are flying away from her walls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Three years did she suffer, besieged by her foes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her gates were thrown down and defiled by the feet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who brought to poor Erech her tears and her woes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In vain to our Ishtar with prayers we entreat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    To Ishtar bowed down doth our Bel thus reply,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      "Come, Ishtar, my queenly one, hide all thy tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our hero, Tar-u-man-i izzu Sar-ri,[25]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In Kipur is fortified with his strong spears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The hope of Kardunia,[26] land of my delight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Shall come to thy rescue, upheld by my hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Deliverer of peoples, whose heart is aright,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Protector of temples, shall lead his brave bands."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Awake then, brave Accad, to welcome the day!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Behold thy bright banners yet flaming on high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Triumphant are streaming on land and the sea!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Arise, then, O Accad! behold the Sami![27]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Arranged in their glory the mighty gods come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In purple and gold the grand Tam-u[8] doth shine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Over Erech, mine Erech, my beautiful home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Above thy dear ashes, behold thy god's sign!</p>

<p>COLUMN III</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE RESCUE OF ERECH BY IZDUBAR</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heabani, weary, eyes his native land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on his harp now lays his trembling hand;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The song has ended in a joyous lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet, alas! his hands but sadly play:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unused to hope, the strings refuse their aid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To tune in sympathy, and heartless played.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again the minstrel bows his head in woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the hot tear-drops from his eyelids flow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And chanting now a mournful melody,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er Erech's fall, thus sang an elegy:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[1] "How long, O Ishtar, will thy face be turned,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      While Erech desolate doth cry to thee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy towers magnificent, oh, hast thou spurned?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her blood like water in Ul-bar,[2] oh, see!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The seat of thine own oracle behold!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The fire hath ravaged all thy cities grand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And like the showers of Heaven them all doth fold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O Ishtar! broken-hearted do I stand!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Oh, crush our enemies as yonder reed!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For hopeless, lifeless, kneels thy bard to thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And, oh! I would exalt thee in my need,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      From thy resentment, anger, oh, us free!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>With eyes bedimmed with tears, he careful scans</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The plain, "Perhaps the dust of caravans</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is! But no!! I see long lines of spears!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A warrior from the lifting cloud appears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And chariots arrayed upon the plain!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And is the glorious omen not in vain?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What! no?" He rubs his eyes in wild surprise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And drinks the vision while he loudly cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Oh, joy! our standards flashing from afar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He comes! he comes! our hero Izdubar!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He grasps his harp inspired, again to wake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In song—the cry of battle now doth break.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   "Nin-a-rad,[3] servant of our great Nin,[4]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Shall lead our hosts to victory!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    God of the chase and war, o'er him, oh, shine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri![5]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   "Let Elam fall! the cause of Accad's woes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Revenge of Erech, be the cry!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This land our father's blessed, our king they chose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our holy fathers sleep upon this plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      We conquer, or we here will die;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For victory, then raise the cry, ye men!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The minstrel ceases, lifts his hands on high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And still we hear his joyful waning cry:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now echoed by yon hosts along the sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"He comes! Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great Accad's hosts arrayed with spears and shields</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are coming! see them flashing o'er the fields!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he! bright flashing as the god's attire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth lead in burnished gold, our king of fire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His armor shines through yonder wood and fen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That tremble 'neath the tread of armèd men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See! from his jewelled breastplate, helmet, fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The rays like Samas from the cloudless sky!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How martially he rides his sable steed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That proudly treads and lifts his noble head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While eagerly he gallops down the line,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bears his princely load with porte divine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now, along the plains there sounds afar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The piercing bugle-note of Izdubar;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Erech's walls and turrets are in view,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And high the standards rise of varied hue.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The army halts; the twanging bows are strung;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from their chariots the chieftains sprung.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The wheeling lines move at each chief's command,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With chariots in front;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                        On either hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Extend the lines of spears and cavalry,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wingèd storm-cloud waiting for its prey:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! while Accad's army ready waits,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The enemy are swarming from the gates.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The charge, from either host, the trumpets sound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bristling chariots from each army bound:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A cloud of arrows flies from Accad's bows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That hides the sun, and falls among their foes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now roars the thunder of great Accad's cars,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their brazen chariots as blazing stars</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through Nuk-khu's[6] depths with streams of blazing fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus fall upon the foe with vengeful ire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The smoking earth shakes underneath their wheels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from each cloud their thunder loudly peals.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus Accad on their foes have fiercely hurled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their solid ranks with Nin-rad's flag unfurled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The charging lines meet with a fearful sound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As tempests' waves from rocks in rage rebound;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The foe thus meet the men of Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While o'er the field fly the fierce gods of war.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dark Nin-a-zu[7] her torch holds in her hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With her fierce screams directs the gory brand;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Mam-mit[8] urges her with furious hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And coiling dragons[9] poison all the land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With their black folds and pestilential breath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In fierce delight thus ride the gods of death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The shouts of Accad mingle with the cries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of wounded men and fiery steeds, which rise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From all the fields with shrieks of carnage, war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till victory crowns the host of Izdubar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The chariots are covered with the slain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And crushed beneath lie dead and dying men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And horses in their harness wounded fall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With dreadful screams, and wildly view the wall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of dying warriors piling o'er their heads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wonder why each man some fury leads;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And others break across the gory plain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In mad career till they the mountain gain;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And snorting on the hills in wild dismay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One moment glance below, then fly away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away from sounds that prove their masters, fiends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away to freedom snuffing purer winds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within some cool retreat by mountain streams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where peacefully for them, the sun-light gleams.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last the foe is scattered o'er the plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Accad fiercely slays the flying men;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When Izdubar beholds the victory won</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By Accad's grand battalions of the sun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His bugle-call the awful carnage stays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then loud the cry of victory they raise.</p>

<p>COLUMN IV</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CORONATION OF IZDUBAR</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A crowd of maidens led a glorious van;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With roses laden the fair heralds ran,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With silver-throated music chant the throng,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweetly sang the coronation song:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now we see the gorgeous cavalcade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the walls in Accad's grand parade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They pass, led by the maidens crowned with flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who strew the path with fragrance;—to the towers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And walls and pillars of each door bright cling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The garlands. Hear the maidens joyful sing!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh, shout the cry! Accadians, joyful sing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For our Deliverer! Oh, crown him King!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then strew his path with garlands, tulips, rose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wave his banners as he onward goes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our mighty Nin-rad comes, oh, raise the cry!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We crown Tar-u-ma-ni iz-zu sar-ri!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Away to Samas' temple grand, away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He is our chosen Sar[1] this glorious day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Oh, send the Khanga[2] through the air!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then chant the chorus, all ye hosts above!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O daughters, mothers, sing for him we love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His glory who can sing, who brings us joy?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For hope and gladness all our hearts employ.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He comes, our hope and strength in every war:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We crown him as our king, our Izdubar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Away to Samas' temple grand, away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For Accad crowns him, crowns him there!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He is our chosen Sar this glorious day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Oh, send the Khanga through the air!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Toward the temple filed the long parade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The nobles led while Accad's music played;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The harps and timbrels, barsoms, drums and flutes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unite with trumpets and the silver lutes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Surrounded by his chieftains rides the Sar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In purple robes upon his brazen car.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bedecked with garlands, steeds of whitest snow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The chariot draw in state with movement slow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each steed led by a <emphasis>kisib</emphasis>, nobleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A score of beauteous horses linked in span.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The army follows with their nodding plumes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And burnished armor, trumpets, rolling drums,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And glistening spears enwreathed with fragrant flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While scarfs are waving from the crowded towers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shouts of joy their welcome loud proclaim,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from each lip resounds their monarch's name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now before the holy temple stands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The chariot, in silence cease the bands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around an altar stand the waiting priests,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And held by them, the sacrificial beasts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hero from his chair descends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bowing to the priests, he lowly bends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the sacred altar of the Sun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And prays to Samas, Accad's Holy One.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[3] "O Samas, I invoke thee, throned on high!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Within the cedars' shadow bright thou art,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy footing rests upon immensity;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      All nations eagerly would seek thy heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Their eyes have turned toward thee; O our Friend!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Whose brilliant light illuminates all lands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Before thy coming all the nations bend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Oh, gather every people with thy hands!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For thou, O Samas, knowest boundaries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of every kingdom, falsehood dost destroy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And every evil thought from sorceries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of wonders, omens, dreams that do annoy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And evil apparitions, thou dost turn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To happy issue; malice, dark designs;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And men and countries in thy might o'erturn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And sorcery that every soul maligns.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Oh, in thy presence refuge let me find!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      From those who spells invoke against thy King,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Protect one! and my heart within thine, oh, bind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      [4]Thy breath within mine inmost soul, oh, bring!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That I with thee, O Samas, may rejoice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And may the gods who me created, take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy hands and lead me, make thy will my choice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      [5]Direct my breath, my hands, and of me make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    They servant, Lord of light of legions vast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O Judge, thy glory hath all things surpassed!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King then rises, takes the sacred glass,[6]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And holds it in the sun before the mass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of waiting fuel on the altar piled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The centring rays—the fuel glowing gild</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With a round spot of fire and quickly, spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above the altar curling, while they sing!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[7] "Oh, to the desert places may it fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This incantation holy!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O spirit of the heavens, us this day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Remember, oh, remember!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O spirit of the earth, to thee we pray,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Remember! Us remember!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   "O God of Fire! a lofty prince doth stand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A warrior, and son of the blue sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Before the God of Fire in thine own land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Before thy holy fires that from us free</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Dread Darkness, where dark Nuk-khu reigns.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Our prince, as monarch we proclaim,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His destiny thy power maintains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Oh, crown his glory with wide fame!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   "With bronze and metal thou dost bless</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      All men, and givest silver, gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The goddess with the hornèd face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Did bless us with thee from of old.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    From dross thy fires change gold to purity;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Oh, bless our fire-king, round him shine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With Heaven's vast sublimity!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And like the earth with rays divine,</p>
<empty-line/>

      As the bright walls of Heaven's shrine."</p>

<p><strong>ISHTAR AND HER MAIDS IN THE FAVORITE HAUNT OF IZDUBAR</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The king while hunting where a forest grows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around sweet hyacinths and budding rose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where a soft zephyr o'er them gently flows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the dark <emphasis>sik-ka-ti</emphasis>[1] where Kharsak[2] glows;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Sedu[3] softly dances on the leaves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And a rich odorous breath from them receives;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where tulips peep with heliotrope and pink,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With violets upon a gleaming brink</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of silver gliding o'er a water-fall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That sings its purling treasures o'er a wall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of rugged onyx sparkling to the sea:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A spot where Zir-ri[4] sport oft merrily,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where Hea's[5] arm outstretched doth form a bay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wild, sheltered, where his sea-daughters play;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A jasper rock here peeps above the waves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of emerald hue; with them its summit laves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Around, above, this cool enchanting cove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bend amorous, spicy branches; here the dove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oft coos its sweetest notes to its own mate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fragrance pure, divine, the air doth freight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sport with gods no lovelier place is found,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With love alone the mystic woods resound.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here witching Zi-na-ki[6] oft drag within</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The waves unwilling Zi-si;[7] here the din</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of roars of sullen storms is never known</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When tempests make the mighty waters groan;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor sound of strife is heard, but rippling rills,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or softest note of love, the breezes fills.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And here the king in blissful dreams oft lies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Mid pure ambrosial odors, and light flies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tune in bliss; away from kingly care,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hollow splendor of the courtly glare;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away from triumphs, battle-fields afar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The favorite haunt of huntsman Izdubar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Queen of Love the glowing spot surveys,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sees the monarch where he blissful lays;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And watching till he takes his bow and spear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To chase the wild gazelles now browsing near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She, ere the king returns, near by arrives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With her two maids; with them for love connives,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Joy and seduction thus voluptuous fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her Samkhatu,[8] Kharimtu[9] from the sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As gently, lightly as a spirit's wing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oft carries gods to earth while Sedu sing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus, they, with lightest step, expectant stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within this lovely spot beneath the wood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Their snowy limbs they bare, undraped now stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the rock at Ishtar's soft command.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like marble forms endued with life they move,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thrill the air with welcome notes of love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>its-tu-ri Same mut-tab-ri</emphasis>[10] sang</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their sweetest notes, and the <emphasis>Khar-san-u</emphasis>[11] rang</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With songs of thrushes, turtle-doves and jays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And linnets, with the nightingale's sweet lays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Goldfinches, magpies and the wild hoopoes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With cries of green-plumed parrots and cuckoos,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pee-wits and sparrows join the piercing cries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of gorgeous herons, while now upward flies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The eagle screaming, joyful spreads his wings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above the forest; and the woodchuck rings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wild tattoo upon the trees around;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And humming-birds whirr o'er the flowering ground</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In flocks, and beat the luscious laden air</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With emerald and gold, and scarlet, where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These perfect forms with godly grace divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In loveliness upon the rock recline.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet joy is slender formed, with bright black eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That sparkle oft and dance with joy's surprise;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Seduction, with her rare voluptuous form,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enchanteth all till wildest passions warm</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The blood and fire the eye beneath her charm;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All hearts in heaven and earth she doth disarm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Queen with every perfect charm displayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Delights the eye, and fills the heart, dismayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fear, lest the bright phantom may dissolve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To airy nothingness, till fierce resolve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fills each who her beholds, while love doth dart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From liquid eyes and captivates the heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She is the queen who fills the earth with love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And reigns unrivalled in her realms above.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Beware, ye hearts! beware! who feel the snare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Ishtar, lest ye tread upon the air;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When ye her rosy chain of fragrance wear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When blindness strikes the eye, and deaf the ear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Becomes, and heartstrings only lead you then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till ye return to common sense again;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enthralled mayhap and captive led in chains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ye then will leisure have to bear your pains;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or if perchance a joy hath come to thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through all thy joyous life, then happy be!</p>

<p><strong>IZDUBAR FALLS IN LOVE WITH ISHTAR, THE QUEEN OF LOVE</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The hour has come when Izdubar will seek</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The cool enchantment of the cove, and slake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His thirst with its sweet waters bubbling pure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where Love has spread for him her sweetest lure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maids expectant listening, watch and wait</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His coming; oft in ecstacies they prate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er his surprise, and softly sport and splash</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The limpid waves around, that glowing flash</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like heaps of snowy pearls lung to the light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By Hea's[1] hands, his Zir-ri[2] to delight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now upon the rock each maid reclines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While Ishtar's form beneath them brightly shines;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the fountain stands the lovely god,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The graceful sovereign of Love's sweet abode.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"He comes; the shrubs of yonder jasmine near</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are rustling, oh, he comes! my Izdubar!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus her love she greets: "Why art thou here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou lovely mortal! king art thou, or seer?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We reck not which, and welcome give to thee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wouldst thou here sport with us within the sea?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then, as if her loveliness forgot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She quickly grasped her golden locks and wrought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Them round her form of symmetry with grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That well became a god, while o'er her face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of sweetest beauty blushes were o'erspread;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Thou see-est only Nature's robe," she said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"'Tis all I wish while sporting with my maids,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all alone no care have we for jades;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if with thee we can in truth confide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We here from all the world may cosey hide."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She hurls a glance toward him, smiling naïve,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then bounding from the rock, peeps from a wave;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The waters fondling her surround, embrace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her charms; and now emerging with rare grace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She turning says:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                  "Make haste, my hearts!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come forth! attend your queen!" and then she parts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The azure waves, to where, in dumb surprise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King enchanted stands, and fondly eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Queen divine, while fascinating thrills</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweep wildly through his breast; as fragrance fills</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The rose-tree groves, or gardens of the gods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or breezes odorous from the Blest Abodes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A longing, rising, fills his inmost soul</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this sweet queen who offers him a goal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His stormy life has never known, since he,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His loved one lost beneath the raging sea;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all his calm resolves to seek no more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A joy which passed and left his heart forlore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are breaking, vanishing beneath her charms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dissolving as the mists, when sunlight warms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The earth, then scorching drinks the rising dews;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till he at last no longer can refuse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And love directs while he the goddess greets:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Such wondrous beauty here no mortal meets;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But come, thou Zir-ru,[3] with me sweetly rest;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Primroses, gentians, with their charms invest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My mossy couch, with odorous citron-trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And feathery palms above; and I will please</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee with a mortal's love thou hast not known;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In pure love mingling let our spirits run,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For earthly joys are sweeter than above,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That rarest gift, the honeyed kiss of love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On earth, is sweeter bliss than gods enjoy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their shadowy forms with love cannot employ</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such pleasure as a mortal's sweet caress.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Zi-ru, and thy spirit I will bless;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Mandrake[4] ripened golden, glows around;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fruit of Love is fragrant on the ground."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Amid the Dud'im[5] plants he now reclines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to his welcome fate himself resigns;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The lovely queen beside him now doth lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And leads his soul along the blissful way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That comes to every heart that longs for love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When purest joy doth bless us from above;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From her soft liquid eyes the love-light speaks,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And her warm hands she lays in his, and wakes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath her touch a thrill of wild desire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until his blood now seems like molten fire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her eyes half closed begat a passion wild,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With her warm breast, her loves hath beguiled;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She nearer creeps with hot and balmy breath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And trembling form aglow, and to him saith:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"My lips are burning for a kiss, my love!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A prize like this, a heart of stone would move,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he his arms around her fondly placed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till she reclined upon his breast, embraced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their lips in one long thrilling rapture meet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But hark! what are these strains above so sweet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That float around, above, their love surround?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An-nu-na-ci[6] from forests, mounts around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the streams and lakes, and ocean, trees,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all that haunt the godly place, to please</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The lovers, softly chant and dance around</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To cymbals, lyres until the rocks resound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of goddess Ishtar chant, and Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Queen of Love wed to the King of War.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he alarmed starts up and springs away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And furious cries, to Ishtar's wild dismay:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What meanest thou, thou wanton brazen thing?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wouldst thou on me the direst curses bring?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! the goddess is transformed! the crown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of her own silver skies shines like the sun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er her dazzling robes a halo falls;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her stately form with glory him appals,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Heaven's dazzling splendor o'er her flows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With rays celestial; o'er her brow there glows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A single star.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>             "Have I embraced a god?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He horrified now cries; and she doth nod</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Assent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "But, oh! wilt thou thy queen forgive?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I love thee! stay! oh, stay! my heart you grieve!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He springs beyond the mystic circling ring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from their sight thus glides the angry King,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the wood himself he doth disguise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In tattered garments, on his steed he flies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when he comes in sight of Erech's gate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His beggar's mantle throws aside; in state</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again enrobed, composed his anxious face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through Erech's gates he rides with kingly grace;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er his adventure thus the King reflects:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Alas my folly leads, my life directs!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis true, the goddess hath seductive charms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

E'en yet I feel her warm embracing arms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enough! her love from me I'll drive away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! for me, is this unfruitful day!"</p>

<p><strong>ISHTAR'S MIDNIGHT COURTSHIP IN THE PALACE OF IZDUBAR.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>As Samas' car sank in the glowing west,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Sin the moon-god forth had come full drest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For starry dance across the glistening skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sound of work for man on earth now dies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all betake themselves to sweet repose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The silver light of Sin above bright flows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And floods the figures on the painted walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er sculptured lions, softly, lightly falls;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like grim and silent watch-dogs at the door</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They stand; in marble check their leaping roar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King within his chamber went his way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon his golden jewelled couch he lay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The silken scarlet canopy was hung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In graceful drapery and loosely clung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around his couch, and purple damask cloths</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Embroidered with rare skill, preserved from moths</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By rich perfumes, to the carved lintel clung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In graceful folds; thus o'er the entrance hung.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Queen Ishtar softly comes, and o'er his dreams</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A mystic spell she draws, until it seems</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While half awake he lies, that she is yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Close nestling in his arms, as he had met</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her in the wood, and with her there reclined,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While her soft arms around him were entwined.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus while he sleeps she hovers o'er his bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With throbbing heart, and close inclines her head</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until her lips near touch the sleeping King's,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But daring not to kiss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                        She love thus brings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All through his dreams; until one misty night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While he yet restless tossed, the lovely sprite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sunk him to deeper sleep with her soft lyre</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While hanging o'er his couch consumed with fire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That nestling around her heart-strings fiercely burned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until at last lulled by the strain he turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon his couch at rest, and she now lay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside him closely, when she heard him say:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"My love thou art, but canst not be!" No more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He murmurs, then inflamed she sought the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Perchance the <emphasis>su-khu-li</emphasis>[1] sleep not!" she said;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And satisfied, turned where her lover laid;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to his royal couch she crept again;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her bliss will have despite of gods and men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her hot and burning lips cannot resist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tempting treasure lying there, nor missed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall be the dearest joys of love from her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who rules all hearts in Heaven, earth, and air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her right divine that blessing sweet to take,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She will assert, her burning thirst to slake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>His couch the Heavenly Queen of Love now graces,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on his breast her glorious head she places;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Embracing him, she softly through her lips</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And his, the sweetest earthly nectar sips,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While he in sleep lies murmuring of love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she in blissful ecstasy doth move.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her lips to his, she wildly places there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until to him it seems a fond nightmare.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And thus, against his will, she fondly takes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What he her shall deny when he awakes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The stolen kisses both the lovers thrill:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unquenched her warm desire would kiss him still,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But his hot blood now warms him in his dream</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which is much more to him than it doth seem;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And clasping her within convulsing arms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Receives a thrill that all his nerves alarms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wakes him from the dreams she had instilled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"What means this fantasy that hath me filled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And spirit form that o'er my pillow leans;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I wonder what this fragrant incense means?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, tush! 'tis but an idle, wildering dream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But how delightful, joyous it did seem!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her beauteous form it had, its breath perfume;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do spirit forms such loveliness assume?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The goddess yet dares not her form reveal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And quickly she herself doth now conceal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behind the damask curtains at the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When he awoke, sprang to the chamber floor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As his own maid the queen herself transforms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Says entering in haste:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                        "What wild alarms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee, Sar?" and then demure awaits reply,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In doubt to hear or to his bosom fly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"My maid art thou? 'Tis well, for I have dreamed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of spirits, as a Zi-ru fair it seemed."</p>

<p><strong>THE KING'S SECOND DREAM AND EARLY RIDE UPON SUMIR'S PLAIN, AND
HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT ON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The night is fleeing from the light of dawn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which dimly falls upon the palace lawn;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King upon his royal <emphasis>dum-khi</emphasis>[1] sleeps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to his couch again Queen Ishtar creeps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In spite his dream to dismal thoughts she turns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her victim tosses, now with fever burns:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He wildly starts, and from his <emphasis>dum-khi</emphasis> springs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While loud his voice throughout the palace rings:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Ho! vassals! haste to me! your King!" he cries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And stamping fiercely while his passions rise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>sukhu-li</emphasis>[2] and <emphasis>masari</emphasis>[3] rush in:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"What trouble, Sar? have foes here come within?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then searching around they in his chamber rush,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And eagerly aside the curtains push.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King yet paces on the floor with strides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That show the trouble of his mind, and chides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Them all as laggards; "Soon the sun will rise:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My steed prepared bring hence!" he turning cries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He mounts and gallops through the swinging gates,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor for attendance of his vassals waits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor turns his face toward the <emphasis>nam-za-khi</emphasis>,[4]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who quickly opened for the King to fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without the gates; across the plains he rides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away unmindful where his steed he guides.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The horse's hoofs resound upon the plain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the lone horseman with bewildered brain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To leave behind the phantoms of the night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rides fiercely through the early morning light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beyond the orange orchards, citron groves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Mid feathery date-palms he reckless roves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fields of yellow grain mid fig-trees flash</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unseen, and prickly pears, pomegranates, dash</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In quick succession by, till the white foam</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From his steed's mouth and quiv'ring flanks doth come;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor heeds the whitened flowing mane, but flies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While clouds of dust him follow, and arise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behind him o'er the road like black storm clouds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While Zu[5] the storm-bird onward fiercely goads</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seven[6] raven spirits of the air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Nus-ku[7] opens wide the fiery glare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of pent-up lightnings for fierce Gibil's[8] hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who hurls them forth at Nergal's[9] stern command,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Rimmon[10] rides triumphant on the air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ninazu[11] for victims doth prepare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King rides from the road into the wild,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor thought of danger, his stern features smiled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the worn steed from a huge lion shied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which turning glanced at them and sprang aside;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now Zi-pis-au-ni[12] fly before the King.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yellow leopards through the rushes spring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon Euphrates' banks his steed he reins,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And views the rosy wilds of Sumir's plains.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looked toward the east across the plain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That stretched afar o'er brake and marshy fen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And clustering trees that marked the Tigris' course;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now beyond the plain o'er fields and moors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mountain range of Zu[13] o'er Susa's land.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is glowing 'neath the touch of Samas' hand;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For his bright face is rising in the east,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shifting clouds from sea and rising mist,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The robes of purple, violet and gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With rosy tints the form of Samas fold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tamarisk and scarlet mistletoe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With green acacias' golden summits glow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And citron, olives, myrtle, climbing vine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arbutus, cypress, plane-tree rise divine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The emerald verdure, clad with brilliant hues,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With rose-tree forests quaffs the morning dews.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King delighted bares his troubled brow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In Samas' golden rays doth holy bow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But see! a shadow steals along the ground!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And trampling footsteps through the copses sound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar, his hand placed on his sword,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Loud cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            "Who cometh o'er mine Erech's sward?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An armèd warrior before him springs;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King, dismounted, his bright weapon swings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"'Tis I, Prince Dib-bara,[14] Lord Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now at last alone we meet in war;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My soldiers you o'erthrew upon the field,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But here to Nuk-khu's[15] son thine arm shall yield!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The monarch eyes the warrior evil-born,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus replies to him with bitter scorn:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"And dost thou think that Samas' son shall die</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By a vile foe who from my host did fly?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or canst thou hope that sons of darkness may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Heaven-born of Light and glory slay?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As well mayst hope to quench the god of fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But thou shalt die if death from me desire."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The giant forms a moment fiercely glared,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And carefully advanced with weapons bared,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which flash in the bright rays like blades of fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now in parry meet with blazing ire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each firmly stood and rained their ringing blows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And caught each stroke upon their blades, till glows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The forest round with sparks of fire that flew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like blazing meteors from their weapons true;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And towering in their rage they cautious sprung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon each, foiled, while the deep Suk-ha[16] rung.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last the monarch struck a mighty blow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His foeman's shield of gold, his blade cleft through;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And as the lightning swung again his sword,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And struck the chieftain's blade upon the sward,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A Sedu springs from out the tangled copse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And at his feet the sword still ringing drops.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King his sword placed at his foeman's throat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shouted:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>             "Hal-ca[17] to yon waiting boat!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or I will send thy body down this stream!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Ca is-kab-bu! va kal-bu!</emphasis>[18] whence you came!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The chief disarmed now slunk away surprised,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er the strength of Sar-dan-nu[19] surmised.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King returns, and rides within the gate</p>

<p>

Of Erech, and the council entered late.</p>

<p>COLUMN III</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>IZDUBAR RELATES HIS SECOND DREAM TO HIS SEERS, WHO CANNOT INTERPRET IT</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The counsellors assembled round the throne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the council halls of <emphasis>zam-at</emphasis>[1] stone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now greet their monarch, and behold his face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With trouble written on his brow, and trace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Uneasiness within that eagle eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While he with stately tread, yet wearily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His throne approached; he turned to the mu-di,[2]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And swept a glance upon his khas-iz-i.[3]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Uneasy they all eyed his troubled face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For he had ridden at a furious pace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>abuli</emphasis>[4] had told them on that morn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How he across the plains had wildly torn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To drive away some vision of the night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One asked, "Hath our Sardan-nu's dreams been light?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or hath dread phantoms o'er thy pillow hung?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For trouble on thy countenance hath clung."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The monarch startled at the question eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The councillor, and to him thus replies:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"'Tis true, my counsellors and wisest men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I dreamed a fearful dream Sat mu-si;[5] when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have disclosed it, if one clear reveals</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Its meaning all and naught from me conceals,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On him will I the greatest wealth bestow:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will ennoble him, and the <emphasis>sib-zu</emphasis>[6]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A <emphasis>ku-bar-ra</emphasis>[7] for him shall rich prepare;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As my <emphasis>tur-tan-u</emphasis>[8] he shall be, and seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Decked with a golden chain shall next preside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At every feast, and break his bread beside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King, and highest rank he shall attain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Mong counsellors, and mine own favor gain;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seven wives to him I will allow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And a grand palace. This as King I vow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The scribe it shall enroll above my seal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As Erech's Sar's decree beyond repeal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I dreamed upon my <emphasis>dum-khi</emphasis>[9] fast asleep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The stars from heaven fell from yonder deep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To earth; and one, with fierceful heat my back</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Did pierce as molten fire, and left its track</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of flames like some huge ball along my spine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then transformed, it turned its face to mine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As some fierce god it glowed before my sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till agony was lost in dread affright.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I rooted stood, in terror, for its face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was horrible; I saw in its feet's place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A lion's claws. It sprang, my strength it broke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And slew me, gloating over me! Awoke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I sprang, methought I was a corpse <emphasis>ka-ra</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Va tal-ka mat sar, talka bu-la sha</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Ra-pas-ti sat-ti, ar-id-da! ka-rat</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Va hal-li-ka! lik-ru-bu ki-mi-ta!</emphasis>[10]"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seers in silence stand, perplexed and think;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But from the task at once the wisest shrink.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King each face soon read:</p>
<p>                              "Ye tell me no?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And nodding all, concealed from him their woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For they beheld within the dream some fate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Impending o'er him born of godly hate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And durst not to their monarch prate their fears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For flatterers of kings are all his seers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King impatient eyed them all with scorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hid his thoughts by wildest passions born;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then at last contemptuous to them said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"So all my seers of trouble are afraid?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or else in ignorance you turn away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis well! I sorely need a seer this day."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And they now prostrate fall before his throne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Forgive thy seers!" one cries, "O mighty One!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For we this dreadful dream do fear portends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy harm! a god some message to thee sends!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We know not what, but fear for thee, our Sar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And none but one can augur it; afar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He lives, Heabani should before the King</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be brought from Za-Ga-bri[11] the <emphasis>na-bu</emphasis>[12] bring!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"'Tis well! Prince Zaidu for the hermit send,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And soon this mystery your Sar will end."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King distressed now to the temple goes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To lay before the mighty gods his woes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This prayer recites to drive away bad dreams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While Samas' holy altar brightly gleams:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

[13] "O Samas! may my prayer bring me sweet rest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And may my Lord his favor grant to me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Annihilate the things that me invest!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This day, O God! distressed, I cry to thee!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O goddess! be thou gracious unto me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Receive my prayer, my sins forgive I pray:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My wickedness and will arrayed 'gainst thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, pardon me! O God, be kind this day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My groaning may the seven winds destroy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Clothe me with deep humility! receive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My prayers, as wingèd birds, oh, may they fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fishes carry them, and rivers weave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Them in the waters on to thee, O God!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As creeping things of the vast desert, cry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I unto thee outstretched on Erech's sod;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the river's lowest depths I pray;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart cause thou to shine like polished gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though food and drink of Nin-a-zu[14] this day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be mine, while worms and death thy servant fold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, from thine altar me support, protect,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In low humility I pray, forgive!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Feed me with joy, my dreams with grace direct;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The dream I dreamed, oh favorable give</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To me its omen filled with happiness!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May Mak-hir,[15] god of dreams, my couch invest!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With visions of Bit-sag-gal my heart bless,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The temple of the gods, of Nin, with rest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unbroken, and to Merodach I pray!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The favoring one, to prosper me and mine:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

[16]Oh, may thy entering exalted be!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thy divinity with glory shine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And may our city shine with glowing meads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all my people praise thy glorious deeds."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now to Euphrates' banks the Sar and seers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their footsteps turn to pray into the ears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Hea,[17] where, in white, a band of priests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Drawn in a crescent, Izdubar invests.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now at the water's edge he leans, his hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dips in the waves, and pours upon the sands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sparkling drops, while all a hymn descant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Hea, thus the incantation chant:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   "O chant our incantation to the waters pure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Euphrates' waters flowing to the sea!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where Hea's holy face shines bright on every shore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O Sabit[18] of Timatu[19] to ye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    We pray! may your bright waters glowing shine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As Hea's face, and heaving breast divine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   "O Sabit, to your father Hea take our prayer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And may Dao-ki-na,[20] your bright mother, hear!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With joy, oh shine, as peaceful as the sleeping light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O ever may your throbbing waves be bright.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O spirit of the Heaven, hear!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Remember us, Remember!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O spirit of the earth, come near!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Remember us, Remember!</p>

<p><strong>HEABANI, THE HERMIT SEER</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Before a cave within the Gab-ri[1] wild,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A seer is resting on a rock; exiled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By his own will from all the haunts of men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside a pool within a rocky glen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He sits; a turban rests upon his brow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And meets the lengthened beard of whitest snow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This morn an omen comes before his eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And him disturbs with a wild eagle's cries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That fierce attacks a fox before his cave;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For he of beasts is the most cunning knave;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In wait upon the ground the fox hath lain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To lure the bird, which flying deems him slain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He fiercely seizes it, as swooping down,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The bird with its sly quarry would have flown;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But the <emphasis>a-si</emphasis>[2] quick seized it by the throat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While the wide wings with frantic fury smote</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The beast, and the sharp talons deeply tore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Its foe—both greedy for the other's gore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And lo! a voice from yonder sky resounds;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani to his feet now quickly bounds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bowing, listens to the voice that comes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In gentleness; upon the winds it roams</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From yon blue heights like sighing of the trees;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seer in reverence upon his knees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now holy bares his head in Samas' rays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While the soft voice to him thus gently says:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"A messenger, Heabani, soon shall come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With offers rich, to leave thy lonely home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This eagle sought its food and found a snare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The messenger will come from Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To learn from thee the meaning of his dream</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which goddess Ishtar sent,—a snare for him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then to the messenger prove not a snare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As yonder <emphasis>a-si</emphasis> doth the eagle tear."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The seer in fury tore his beard of snow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cried—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>             "Alas! my days shall end in woe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within these wilds my happiness is mine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No other joys I seek, my god divine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would upon these rocks lie down to die,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon my back here sleep eternally."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Samas urging, to him thus replied:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Heabani, hast thou not some manly pride?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thinkest thou no joy thou here wilt lose?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The lovely Sam-kha-tu[3] the seer may choose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arrayed in trappings of divinity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the insignia of royalty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani then in Erech shall be great,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And live in happiness and royal state;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar shall hearken, and incline</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His heart in warmest friendship, and recline</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With thee upon a couch of luxury.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seat thee on a throne of royalty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On his left hand, a crown shall grace thy brow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Kings of the earth shall to thee subject bow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kiss thy feet, and Izdubar shall give</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee wealth, and thou in luxury shalt live.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In silence Erech's men shall bow to thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In royal raiment thou shalt happy be."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani listened to the words that came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Samas, and his brow was lit with shame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hear the god of war urge him to go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To earthly happiness—mayhap to woe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But he within his cave now listless turns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When Samas ceased; then to his rock returns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seats himself with calmness on his brow;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His thoughts in happy memories now flow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he recalls the blissful days of yore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When he as seer lived on Euphrates' shore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the queen's bard oft tuned a festive lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While soft-eyed maidens dance and cymbals play.</p>

<p><strong>EXPEDITION OF ZAIDU IN SEARCH OF THE SEER</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Prince Zaidu on his steed now hastes away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the plains he travelled all that day;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Next morn the Za-Gabri he slow ascends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Along the mountain sides the horseman wends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the Eri-ni,[1] and cliffs, and sees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The plains and mountains o'er the misty trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the wild summit, and old Khar-sak glow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above them all with its twin crests of snow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He plunges in the wild to seek the cave;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Three days unceasing sought young Zaidu brave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now at last within the glen he rode,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And near approached Heabani's wild abode.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last he sees the seer before his home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with his monster[2] now toward him come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That walked subdued beside the hermit seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus they upon the rocks above appear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Why art thou here in warrior's array?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hermit cries. "I know thee not! away!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"O holy seer, 'tis Zaidu, from our Sar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The king of Erech, chieftain Izdubar."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What seekest thou within my mountain lair?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani angry cried. "What brings thee here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"For thee! if true Heabani is thy name;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I seek the hermit seer of wondrous fame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My king doth offer thee rich gifts of state,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sent me to thee here to make thee great."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"No empty honors do I seek, which void</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of all true happiness, all men have cloyed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Return then to thy haunts of pleasure, pain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thy king's embassy is all in vain."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seer returns within his lonely cave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And leaves the prince alone the beast to brave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last it slinks away within the gloom;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No more from their wild home doth either come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Three days Prince Zaidu watches the dark lair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now his courage turns to blank despair:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seer hath changed his mind since Samas sought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To urge him forth to leave his lonely lot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The prince the mountain precipice now climbs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And peers within while clinging to the limbs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of stunted oaks, and views the mountain lair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But all in vain his calls ring on the air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then mounting wearily his steed he turns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away, and unsuccessful thus returns.</p>

<p><strong>HEABANI RESOLVES TO RETURN TO ERECH</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>As Zaidu sadly turns and rides away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hermit from his cave comes forth to pray:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Alas! hath all these wilds their charms here lost?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And is my breast with wild ambition tost?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My lonely cot I look upon with shame;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again I long to seek the fields of fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where luxury my remaining years</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May crown, and happiness may find—or tears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis true! I should have welcomed the <emphasis>bar-ru;</emphasis>[1]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But he hath since returned to Subartu."[2]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His harp he took from its dust-covered case,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kissed its carved and well-remembered face;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tuning it, he glanced toward the wood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sang his farewell ode to solitude:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Farewell, ye mountains, woods and trees—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My heart doth long again for joy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I love your wilds and mossy leas,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But oh, your solitude doth cloy!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    I love to see the <emphasis>bur-khi-is</emphasis>[3]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Sweep stately o'er the mossy rocks;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And <emphasis>tsabi</emphasis>[4] in a wild like this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Hear the tattoo of red woodchucks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    I love the cries of <emphasis>lig-bar-ri</emphasis>[5]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The <emphasis>nes-i</emphasis>[6] calling for their prey;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And leaping of the <emphasis>na-a-li</emphasis>[7]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That fly in wildest fear away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    I love the <emphasis>bu-hir-tser-i</emphasis>[8] all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      <emphasis>Khar-sa-a-nii sa-qu-u-tu;</emphasis>[9]</p>
<empty-line/>

    Hear <emphasis>cu-uts-tsi</emphasis>[10] with thunder roll</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Across the skies within my view.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    I love to see the <emphasis>ca-ca-bi</emphasis>[11]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Peep through the pine-trees o'er my home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And watch the wild <emphasis>tu-ra-a-khi</emphasis>[12]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And <emphasis>arme</emphasis>[13] welcome, to me come.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Farewell! ye solitudes, farewell!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I will not moulder rotting lie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With no one's lips to wish me well;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O give me immortality!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    But what is fame? A bubble blown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Upon the breeze, that bursts its shell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all our brightest hopes are flown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And leaves our solitude a hell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The holy minstrel bows his head in woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweeps the harpstrings with a movement slow;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then lifts his eyes toward the setting sun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His evening invocation thus begun:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    [14]O Samas! to the lifting of my hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Show favor! unto me thy servant turn!</p>
<empty-line/>

    What man before thy blessèd Light withstands?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O thou! what mortal thine own words can learn?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And who can rival them inviolate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      [15]Among the gods no equal thou hast found.</p>

<p>

    In Heaven who of all the gods is great?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O thou alone! art great through Heaven's bound!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    On earth what man is great? alas! no one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For thou alone art great! through earth's vast bounds.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When wide thy awful voice in Heaven resounds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The gods fall prostrate to our Holy One;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When on the earth thy voice afar resounds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The genii[16] bow to thee and kiss the dust.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In thee, O Samas! do I put my trust,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For thy great love and mercy wide abounds!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    O my Creator, God, thy watchfulness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O'er me, oh may it never cease!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Keep thou the opening of my lips! the fleece</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of purest snow be my soul's daily dress.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Guard thou my hands! O Samas, Lord of Light!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And ever keep my life and heart aright!</p>

<p>"The prince returns, O Sar!" the herald said,</p>

Heabani with his beast in his cave went,</p>
<empty-line/>

And Zaidu waited, but his courage spent</p>

When he beheld the seer and beast remain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the cave, and all his words were vain.</p>
<empty-line/>

The prince remains without with downcast face,</p>
<empty-line/>

And beg of thee, his Sar, thy sovereign grace."</p>

<p><strong>ZAIDU'S RETURN, AND HIS INSTRUCTION TO TAKE TWO MAIDS WITH HIM TO ENTICE
THE SEER FROM HIS CAVE</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Prince Zaidu prostrate bows before the Sar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arises, thus narrates to Izdubar:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Thy sovereign, Zaidu hath his king obeyed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The royal mission I have thus essayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As Amu's[1] soldier; I undaunted tried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To urge my mission which the seer denied.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I firmly met the beast that with him came:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unmanly fear, confess I to my shame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Came o'er me when I first beheld the beast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In vain I plead, and in despair I ceased</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When he refused, and angry from me passed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within his cave, where cliffs and rocks are massed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I climbed, but the wild entrance did not gain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for advice have I returned again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'Tis well, my son," the Sar to Zaidu said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Thy wisdom I commend for thy young head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again upon thy mission thou must go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His might, and strength of purpose, thou dost know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before a maiden's charms will flee away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For he doth love the Zi-Ga-bri[2] that play</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the mountain gorges. Turn thy face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again with manly portance; for I'll grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thine embassy with two of our sweet maids,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who oft shall cheer thee through the mountain glades,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom thou shalt lead before Heabani's den</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With their bright charms exposed within the glen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Take Sam-kha-tu and sweet Khar-imatu:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They will entice the seer when he shall view</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their charms displayed before his wondering eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Sam-kha, Joy, the seer you will surprise;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khar-im-tu will thy plans successful end,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To her seductive glance his pride will bend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet Sam-kha's charms are known, she is our Joy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As Ishtar's aid her charms ne'er cloy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Kharun-tu with her perfect face and form,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hearts of all our court doth take by storm:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When joys by our sweet Sam-kha are distilled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Kharun-tu's love overcomes us till we yield.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus, armed with Love's Seduction and her Joy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The greatest powers of earth thou dost employ;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No flesh can face them but a heart of stone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all the world doth lie before them prone."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Three days Prince Zaidu sat with Kharun-tu</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the cave within Heabani's view;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the pool they waited for the seer:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Erech three days' journey brought them here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But where hath Joy, sweet Sam-kha, roving gone?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When they arrived at setting of the sun</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She disappeared within with waving arms;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With bright locks flowing she displayed her charms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As some sweet <emphasis>zir-ru</emphasis> did young Sam-kha seem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A thing of beauty of some mystic dream.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: "Anu," the King of Heaven.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: "Zi-Gab-ri," spirits of the mountains.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>COLUMN IV</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE TWO MAIDENS ENTICE THE SEER</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Thus in Heabani's cave the maiden went,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er the sleeping seer her form she bent;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er him who with gazelles oft eats his food;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er him who drinks with <emphasis>bhu-ri</emphasis>[1] in the wood;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er him who loves the <emphasis>zir-ri,</emphasis>—of them dreams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sports with them within the mountain streams.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when the gay enticer saw the seer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unconscious sleeping with sweet Joy so near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She clasped him to her breast and kissed his brow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seer awakes, with wonder eyes her now:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Thy glory thou hast brought to me!" he saith,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Sweet Zir-ru comes to me with fragrant breath!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with delight he eyes her beauteous form,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His breast warm moved by the enticer's charm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He springs upon his feet and her pursues:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She laughing flees; to sport with him doth choose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now he eyes his hairy body, arms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Compared to Sam-kha's snowy god-like charms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She give to him her freshness, blooming youth?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She laughing comes again to him,—Forsooth!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her glorious arms she opens, flees away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While he doth follow the enticer gay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He seizes, kisses, takes away her breath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she falls to the ground—perhaps in death</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He thinks, and o'er her leans where she now lay;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last she breathes, and springs, and flees away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But he the sport enjoys, and her pursues;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But glancing back his arms she doth refuse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus three days and four of nights she played;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For of Heabani's love she was afraid.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her joyous company doth him inspire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Sam-kha, joy, and love, and wild desire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was not satisfied unless her form</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Remained before him with her endless charm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But when his <emphasis>bhu-ri</emphasis> of the field the sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beheld, the wild gazelles fled in affright.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now without the cave they came in view</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Zaidu waiting with sweet Kharim-tu,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And when Heabani saw the rounded form</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of bright Kharim-tu, her voluptuous charm</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Drew him to her, and at her feet he sate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With wistful face, resigned to any fate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Kharim-tu, smiling sweetly, bent her head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enticing him the tempter coyly said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Heabani, like a famous god thou art,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why with these creeping things doth sleep thy heart?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come thou with me to Erech Su-bu-ri[2]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Anu's temple Elli-tar-du-si,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ishtar's city where great Izdubar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth reign, the glorious giant king of war;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose mighty strength above his chiefs doth tower,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come see our giant king of matchless power."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her flashing eyes half languid pierce the seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until his first resolves all disappear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And rising to his feet his eyes he turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Toward sweet Joy,[3] whose love for him yet burned;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And eyeing both with beaming face he saith,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"With Sam-kha's love the seer hath pledged his faith;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will go to Elli-tar-du-si,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great Anu's seat and Ishtar's where with thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will behold the giant Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose fame is known to me as king of war;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will meet him there, and test the power</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of him whose fame above all men doth tower.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A <emphasis>mid-dan-nu</emphasis>[4] to Erech I will take,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To see if he its mighty strength can break.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In these wild caves its strength has mighty grown;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If he the beast destroys, I will make known</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His dream to him—e'en all the seer doth know;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now with thee to Erech I will go.</p>

<p><strong>FESTIVAL IN HONOR OF HEABANI, WHO ARRIVES AT ERECH—INTERPRETATION OF THE
DREAM</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The sounds of wild rejoicing now arise;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Heabani comes!" resound the joyful cries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And through the gates of Erech Suburi</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now file the chieftains, Su-khu-li rubi.[1]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A festival in honor of their guest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Sar proclaims, and Erech gaily drest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her welcome warm extends to the famed seer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maidens, Erech's daughters, now appear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With richest kirtles gaily decked with flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on his head they rain their rosy showers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rejoicing sing, while harps and cymbals play,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And laud him to the skies in their sweet way;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And mingling with their joy, their monarch rode</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the seer, who stately after strode</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside his beast, and next the men of fame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maids thus chant high honors to his name:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "A prince we make thee, mighty seer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Be filled with joy and royal cheer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            All hail to Erech's seer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Whom day and night our Sar hath sought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O banish fear! for Hea taught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            The seer, his glory wrought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    He comes! whom Samas loves as gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To Erech grace, our city old;</p>
<empty-line/>

            All wisdom he doth hold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Great Hea doth to him unfold</p>

<p>

    All that remains to man untold;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Give him the chain of gold!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    He cometh from the Za-Gab-ri</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To our dear Erech Su-bu-ri.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Heabani glorify!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Thy dream he will reveal, O Sar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Its meaning show to Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Victorious king of war."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Within the council halls now lead the seers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With trepidation and with many fears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hear the seer explain their monarch's dream.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the royal throne he sits supreme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Among the seers, the Sar, his scribe commands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To read his dream recorded as it stands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In Erech's Gi;[2] who reads it to the seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who answers thus:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  "In this there doth appear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A god, whose ardent love will lead to deeds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of hate against thee, Sar; thy present needs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are great, O king! as fire this love will burn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until the wicked seven[3] on thee turn;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And blood, alone, will not their fury sate:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods will hurl upon thee some dread fate."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In silence, Izdubar the warning heard;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His blood with terror froze, and then was stirred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By passions wild, when he recalled the scene</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Ishtar's love for him by man unseen;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When she so wildly then proclaimed her love;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now with hate his inmost soul doth move,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And her bright form to a black dal-khu[4] turned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And furious passions on his features burned.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then of the first dream he thought, and light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Across his vision broke:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                         "'Tis true! aright</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy seer hath read! for Ishtar came to me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In the first dream, her face e'en yet I see!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Aye, more! her lips to mine again then fell!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her arms I felt around me,—breath too well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I know! of fragrance, while perfume arose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around my dream and fled not at the close;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As frankincense and myrrh it lingered, when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I woke. Ah yes! the queen will come again!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then to his counsellor who wondering stood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor heard his murmuring, but saw subdued</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His features were, at first, and then, they grand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Became with settled hate; he raised his hand;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"'Tis true!" he said, "Reward on him bestow!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then to the waiting feast we all shall go."</p>

<p>

Heabani takes his seat beside his lord.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The choicest viands of the wealthy plain</p>
<empty-line/>

Before them placed and fishes of the main,</p>
<empty-line/>

With wines and cordials, juices rich and rare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The chieftains all enjoy—the royal fare.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This day, with Izdubar they laugh and joke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Mid courtesies and mirth, and oft provoke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ringing merry laughter through the halls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When all are satisfied within the walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their fill have eaten of the royal fare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With wine they banish from them every care.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Su-khu-li[1] with tinkling bells proclaim,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Our Sar would speak! Our king of mighty fame,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who says: "My chieftains, lords, our seer requests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A test of strength before assembled guests;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unarmed requires your Sar-dan-nu to slay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Mid-an-nu[2] which he hath brought to-day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So stand aside, my friends, behold the test!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your Sar will satisfy his seer and guest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The monster now is brought before the king,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani him unchains to let him spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the giant king. His chieftains stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In terror looking at their monarch grand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who smiling stands, his eyes on the beast fixed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While they in wildest terror are transfixed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heabani claps his hands towards the king,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the wild beast upon his form doth spring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The giant grasps its throat in high mid-air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

[3]And holds it 'neath his arm without a fear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With sullen choking roars it struggling dies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While shouts of joy from all the guests arise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mighty deed of strength the seer appals,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And at the feet of Izdubar he falls:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Immortal king! illustrious of men!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy glorious strength reveals the gods again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On earth. To thee I bow in reverent fear,</p>
<empty-line/>

A god returned thou art! O Erech, hear!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of kingdoms thou art blessed with grandest fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That thou among thy kings a god can name."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again they gathered round the festal board,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And joy and revelry they soon restored.</p>

The revels high are raised o'er sparkling wine;</p>

That brings him happiness and thrill his heart—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For one, of all thy kind who can impart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him the holiest bliss, the sweetest joy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That e'er can crown his life so tenderly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He worships thee within a holy fane,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let not his hope and joy be all in vain!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O thou, sweet Queen! we crown thee in our homes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And give to thee our love that holy comes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Heaven to inspire and bless our lives.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this mankind all hope to take pure wives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sacredest of all our temples, shrines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And keep thee pure within sweet love's confines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That we may worship thee, and daily bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Devotions to our altar,—to thee sing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our orisons of praise, and sacred keep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our homes till we shall softly drop asleep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the arms we love so tenderly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And carry with us a sweet memory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of purity and bliss that blessed our lives,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And children gave from sweetest of pure wives.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Thou art our all! O holy woman, pure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forever may thy charms on earth endure!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, trample not upon thy husband's love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For true devotion he doth daily prove.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, shackle not his feet in life's fierce strife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His weary shoulders burden,—blast his life!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or palsy those dear hands that work for thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fill his eyes with tears of agony,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till love shall turn as acid to his teeth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thorns shall tear his side with hellish wreath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And daggers pierce his heart, and ice his soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thou become to him a hated ghoul!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[2]What married woman is untainted, pure?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She, who when married spreads for men no lure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bestows caresses on no man but him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who is her husband; she who doth not trim</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her form to catch the vulgar gaze, nor paints</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Herself, or in her husband's absence taunts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not her sweet purity; exposes not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her form undraped, whose veil no freeman aught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Has raised;[3] or shows her face to others than</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her slaves; and loves alone her husbandman;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She who has never moistened her pure lips</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With liquors that intoxicate;[4] nor sips</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With others joys that sacred are alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him, her strength; who claims her as his own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O Beauty, Purity, my theme inspire!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To woman's love of old, my muse aspire!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When her sweet charms were equally bestowed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fairest of the sex with hopes imbued</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of capturing men of wealth and lives of ease,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When loveliness at public sale[5] doth please</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The nobles of the land to wealth bestow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon ill-favored sisters, maids of woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who claimed no beauty, nor had lovely charms;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When crones and hags, and maids with uncouth forms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Secured a husbandman despite of fate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And love redeemed them from the arms of hate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The proclamation Izdubar had made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bring to the great plaza every maid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Beltis' feast and Hergal's now arrives,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When maidens are selected as the wives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of noblemen or burghers of the towns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cities of the kingdom; when wealth crowns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The nobles richest, ever as of old,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With beauty they have purchased with their gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The festival, the Sabat-tu[6] hath come!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Sabat-tu of Elul! hear the hum</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of voices filling Erech's streets!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maids are coming, how each gaily prates!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The day and hour has come for them to stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And meet the bidders from all Sumir's land;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The day that ends their maidenhood, and brings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Them joy or not. Oh, how the poor young things</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With throbbing hearts approach yon gathering throng</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hear their fate pronounced; but is it wrong?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The custom old, Accadia thinks is good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They all are young and fresh with maidenhood;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ugly ones as well, shall husbands have,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And their young lives from shame thus they will save.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No aged maids shall pass from yonder throng</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With bitterness,—their heart's unuttered song</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For some dear love to end their joyless woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And longings unallayed that e'er may flow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But Love! O where art thou? art thou a thing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That gold may buy? Doth lucre thy bright wing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unfold to hover over human hearts?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, no! Thy presence to our soul imparts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A sweeter joy than selfishness can give,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou givest love that thou mayst love receive;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor asking aught of wealth, of rank, or fame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

True love in palace, hovel, is the same</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweet joy, the holiest of sacred things.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this we worship Ishtar, for she brings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Us happiness, when we ourselves forget</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In the dear arms we love; no coronet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of power, or countless gold, or rank, or fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or aught that life can give, or tongue can name,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can reach the heart that loyally doth love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor hopes of heaven, nor fears of hell can move.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mayhap, this Sabattu, some lover may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All wealth he claims abandon on this day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For the dear heart that seeming pleads to him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While her fond glistening eyes shall on him gleam.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A look, a glance; when mingling souls speak love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will in his breast undying longings move;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And let us hope that when the youths have lain[7]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their all before the herald, that no men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who see their sacrifice will rob their hearts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of all that gives them joy or bliss imparts;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or that this day alone will maidens see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who have not loved, and they will happy be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With him who purchases her as his wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or proud young beauties will enjoy the strife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of bidders to secure their lovely charms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And love may bring their husbands to their arms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The day is sacred, dedicated old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Love and Strength, when loving arms shall fold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A vigorous husband to a maiden's breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where she may ever stay and safely rest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The day of Ishtar, Queen of Love! the day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Nergal, the strong god, to whom they pray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For strength to bless with vigor Accad's sons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For many anxious years this day atones.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[8]This day their Sar the flesh of birds eats not,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor food profaned by fire this day, nor aught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of labor may perform nor <emphasis>zubat</emphasis>[9] change,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor snowy <emphasis>ku-bar-ra</emphasis>[10] anew arrange.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A sacrifice he offers not, nor rides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon his chariot this day, nor guides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His realm's affairs, and his Tur-tan-nu rests.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of soldiers, and of orders, he divests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His mind; and even though disease may fall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon him, remedies he may not call.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The temple he shall enter in the night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pray that Ishtar's favor may delight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His heart; and lift his voice in holy prayer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In Nergal's temple rest from every care,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where he before the holy altar bends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With lifted hands, his soul's petition sends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Around the square the palms and cedars shine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bowers of roses cluster round divine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath an arch of myrtles, climbing vines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And canopy,—with wreathing flowers it shines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There stands a wondrous garland-wreathèd throne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where maids are gathered;—each unmarried one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The timid maids and bold of Babylon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are each in turn led to the rosy throne;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The crowd of bidders round the herald stand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The richest and the poorest of the land.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The queen of Accad's maids doth now appear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We see the burnished chariot coming near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ten beauteous bays with proud steps, nodding plumes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come first; behind, a train of nobles comes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now we see the close-drawn canopy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thrown back by slaves, who step aside, that she</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The queen of beauty crowned with lilies, rose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May here alight.  And see! she queenly goes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With dainty steps between the noblemen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who stand on either side the queen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of beauty of the plains, who first this day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall reign upon the throne, and lead the way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For all the maids who shall be bought for gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus the first upon the throne is sold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She takes her seat beneath the canopy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the throne high raised, that all may see;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As she her veil of fine spun gold flings back</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From her sweet face and o'er her ringlets black,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her large dark eyes, soft as a wild gazelle's,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the richest nobles dart appeals.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her bosom throbs 'neath gems and snowy lace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And robes of broidered satin, velvets, grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her beauty with their pearly folds that fall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around her form.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                  Hark! hear the herald's call!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Behold this pearl! my lords and noblemen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And who will bid for her as wife, my men?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Ana-bilti khurassi ash at ka!"[11]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Akhadu khurassi ana sa-sa!"[12]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"U sinu bilti khurassi!"[11] two cried.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Sal-sutu bilti!"[12] nobles three replied;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And four, and five, and six, till one bid ten,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A vast amount of gold for noblemen:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But see! the bidders in excitement stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around a youth who cries with lifted hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And features pale and stern, who now began</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bid against a wealthy nobleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose countless herds graze far upon the plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His laden ships that ride upon the main</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He counts by scores. He turns his evil eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wolfish face upon the youth and cries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Khamisserit!"[13] The lover answering says:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Esra'a!"[14] "U selasa'a!"[15] then brays</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gray-haired lover. "U irbaha!"[16] cries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The youth, and still the nobleman defies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who answers cooly, "Khausa'a;"[17] and eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The anxious youth, who wildly "Miha!"[18] cries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Mine! mine! she is! though you <emphasis>alapu</emphasis>[19] bid!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"A fool thou art!" the noble, leaving, said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"One hundred talents for a maid!" he sneered,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in the crowd he growling disappeared.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The measures filled with shining gold are brought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus the loveliest of all is bought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The next in beauty on the throne is sold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus the beautiful are sold for gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The richest thus select the beautiful,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The poor must take alone the dutiful</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And homely with a dower which beauty bought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ugliness with gold becomes his lot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ugliest, unsightly, and deformed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is now brought forth; with many wriggles squirmed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She to the throne, where beauty late had sat:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her ugliness distorted thus; whereat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The herald cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  "Who will this woman take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With smallest dowry? She can cook and bake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And many household duties well perform,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Although she does not claim a beauty's charm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who wants a wife?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                   The ugly crone with blinks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth hideous look, till every bidder shrinks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A sorry spectacle, mis-shapen, gross,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She is, and bidders now are at a loss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How much to ask to take the hag to wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last one cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                   "Five <emphasis>bilti,</emphasis>[20] for relief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of herald I will take, to start the bid!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"And four of <emphasis>bilti</emphasis>, I'll take, with the maid!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Three and a half!" one cries with shaking head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"And she is yours, my man!" the herald said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus she bought a husband and a home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And so the scare-crows, scraggy ones, now come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In turn; the lean, ill-favored, gawky, bald,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Long-nosed, uncouth, raw-boned, and those with scald</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And freckled, frowsy, ricketty and squat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The stumpy, bandy-leggèd, gaunt, each bought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A man; though ugly as a toad, they sold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For every man with her received his gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The heaped-up gold which beauteous maids had brought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is thus proportioned to the bidder's lot;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The grisly, blear-eyed, every one is sold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And husbands purchased for a pile of gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And happiness diffused throughout the land;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For when the maid refused her husband's hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She might return by paying back the gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And every maid who thus for wife was sold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Received a bond from him who purchased her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To wed her as his wife, or else incur</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The forfeit of his bond, and thus no maids</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In all the land were found as grumbling jades,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose fate it was to have no husbandman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For every woman had a husband then.</p>

<p>COLUMN II</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>COUNCIL IN THE PALACE</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The seers on silver couches round the throne;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hangings of the carved lintel thrown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Aside; the heralds cried: "The Sar! The Sar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The council opens our King Izdubar!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Sar walked o'er the velvets to his throne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of gold inlaid with gems. A vassal prone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the Sar now placed the stool of gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arranged his royal robes with glittering fold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of laces, fringes rich inwove with pearls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Embroidered with quaint figures, curious twirls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behind the throne a prince of royal blood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arrayed in courtly splendor, waiting stood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gently waved a jewelled fan aloft</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above the Sar's tiara; carpets soft</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Accad's looms the varied tilings bright,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In tasteful order, part conceal from sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The glittering pillars stand with gold o'erlaid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In rows throughout the room to the arcade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the entrance from a columned hall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ivory-graven panels on the wall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On every side are set in solid gold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The canopy chased golden pillars hold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above the throne, and emeralds and gems</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Flash from the counsellor's rich diadems.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In silence all await the monarch's sign:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"This council hath been called, the hour is thine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To counsel with thy King upon a plan</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of conquest of our foes, who ride this plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unchecked around; these Suti should be driven</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Sumir's plain. Have ye our wrongs forgiven?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba hath enjoyed great Accad's spoils</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too long; with him we end these long turmoils.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What sayest thou, Heabani?—all my seers?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath Accad not her chariots and spears?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then one among the wisest seers arose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"To save our precious tune which hourly flows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He should our seer, Rab-sak-i[1] first invite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To lay his plans before the Sar, and light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May break across our vision. I confess</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great obstacles I see, but acquiesce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In any plan you deem may bring success.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods, I feel our cause will gladly bless."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Another spoke, and all agree at last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hear the seer whose wisdom all surpassed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heabani modestly arose and said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gracefully to all inclined his head:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O Sar! thy seer will gladly counsel give</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To thee, and all our seers; my thanks receive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thy great confidence in my poor skill</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To crush our foes who every country fill.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I with the Sar agree that we should strike</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A blow against the rival king, who like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our Sar, is a great giant king, and lives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within a mountain castle, whence he grieves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All nations by his tyranny, and reigns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With haughty power from Kharsak to these plains.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll lead the way, my Sar, to his wild home;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis twenty <emphasis>kas-pu</emphasis>[2] hence, if you will come.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wall surrounds his castle in a wood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With brazen gates strong fastened. I have stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the lofty pines which dwindle these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To shrubs that grow in parks as ornate trees.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mighty walls will reach six <emphasis>gars</emphasis>[3] in height,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And two in breadth, like Nipur's[4] to the sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when you go, take with you many mules;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With men to bring the spoils, and needed tools</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To break the gates, his castle overthrow:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To lose no time, to-morrow we should go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Erech, pines and cedars we can bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all the wealth of Elam's giant king,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Erech fill with glorious parks and halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Remove these <emphasis>man-u-bani,</emphasis>[5] ruined walls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Take to your hearts, ye seers, poor Erech's wrongs!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her fall, the bards of Elam sing in songs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I love dear Erech, may her towers shine!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He seized his harp, thus sung the seer divine:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "O Erech! thy bright plains I love;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Although from thee thy seer did rove,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          My heart remained with thee!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The foe destroyed thy beauteous towers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sa-mu forgot to rain her showers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And could I happy be?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Mine eyes beheld thy fallen gates,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy blood warm flowing in thy streets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          My heart was broken then.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I raised mine eyes and saw thy Sar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In glory on his steed of war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And joy returned again!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    I saw the foe in wild dismay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Before him flee that glorious day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          With joy I heard the cry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of victory resound afar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Saw Elam crushed 'neath Accad's car:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I shouted, Victory!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Away! till birds of prey shall rend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His flesh and haughty Elam bend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Before our mighty Sar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Beneath his forest of pine-trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The battle-cry then loudly raise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          We follow Izdubar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    And may the birds of prey surround</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Khumbaba stretched upon the ground,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Destroy his body there!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Izdubar alone be king,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all his people joyful sing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          With glory crown him here!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    All hail! All hail! our giant King,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The <emphasis>amaranti</emphasis>[6] for him bring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To crown him, crown him here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As King of Accad and Sutu,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all the land of Subar-tu!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          So sayeth Hea's seer!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The counsellors and chieftains wildly cry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around the throne, "All hail <emphasis>izzu sar-ri</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Su-bar-tu!" and shouting leave the halls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To summon Accad's soldiers from the walls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hear the war proclaimed against their foes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Accad's war-cry from them loud arose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

King Izdubar Heabani warmly prest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within his arms upon his throbbing breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And said, "Let us to the war temple go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That all the gods their favor may bestow."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seer replied, "Tis well! then let us wend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our way, and at the altar we will bend,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Ishtar's temple, where our goddess queen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth reign, seek her propitious favor, then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In Samas' holy temple pray for aid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To crush our foe;—with glory on each blade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our hands will carry victory in war."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The chiefs, without the temple, join their Sar.</p>

<p>COLUMN III</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE KING WORSHIPS AT THE SHRINE OF ISHTAR</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[1]The richest and the poorest here must stay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each proud or humble maid must take her way;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Ishtar's temple grand, a lofty shrine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With youth and beauty seek her aid divine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some drive in covered chariots of gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With courtly trains come to the temple old.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With ribbons on their brows all take their seats,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The richer maid of nobles, princes, waits</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within grand chambers for the nobler maids;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The rest all sit within the shrine's arcades.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus fill the temple with sweet beauties, crones;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The latest maids are the most timid ones.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In rows the maidens sat along the halls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And vestibules, on couches, where the walls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were carved with mystic signs of Ishtar's feast;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till at the inner shrine the carvings ceased.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Amid the crowd long silken cords were strung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To mark the paths, and to the pillows clung.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King through the great crowd now pressed his way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Toward the inner shrine, where he may pray.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The jewelled maidens on the cushioned seats,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now babbling hailed the King, and each entreats</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For sacred service, silver or of gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to him, all, their sweetest charms unfold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some lovely were, in tears besought and cried,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And many would a blooming bride provide;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While others were deformed and homely, old,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As spinsters still remained, till now grown bold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They raised their bony arms aloft and bawled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some hideous were with harshest voices squalled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hags like <emphasis>dal-khi</emphasis> from the Under-World,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their curses deep, growled forth from where they curled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But these were few and silent soon became,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hid their ugliness away in shame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For years some maids had waited day and night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But beauty hides the ugly ones from sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King astounded, eyed them seated round;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath their gaze his eyes fell to the ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"And hath great Accad lost so many sons,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And left so many maids unmarried ones?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He eyed the image where the goddess stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon a pedestal of cedar wood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'erlaid with gold and pearls and <emphasis>uk-ni</emphasis> stones,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And near it stands the altar with its cones</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of gold adorned with gems and solid pearls,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the golden censer incense curls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the altar stands a table grand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of solid metal carved with skilful hand;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon it stands a mass of golden ware,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With wines and fruits which pious hands prepare.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The walls are glistening with gold and gems,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The priestesses all wear rich diadems.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Sar now eyes the maidens, while they gaze;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus they expectant wait, while he surveys.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! he takes from them a charming girl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Ishtar's eyes and perfect form, the pearl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of beauty of them all; turns to the shrine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When in her lap he drops a golden coin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And says, "The goddess Ishtar, prosper thee!"[2]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She springs, for she from Ishtar's halls is free,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kneels and weeps before the monarch's feet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O great and mighty Sar I thee entreat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My will is thine, but all my sisters free:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold my sisters here imploring thee!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King gazed at the beauteous pleading face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which roused within his breast the noble race</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before her heavenly charms transfixed he stood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before her heavenly charms transfixed he stood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'Tis well! my daughter, I the favor grant!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to the priestess said, "Let here be sent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great coffers filled with gold! for I release</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These maids. Let all their weary waiting cease,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The price I'll send by messengers to thee."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all rejoicing sing a psalmody.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A ring of maidens round the image forms;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With flashing eyes they sing, with waving arms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wilderness of snowy arms and feet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To song and dance the holy measure beat;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A mass of waving ringlets, sparkling eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In wildest transport round each maiden flies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The measure keeps to sacred psalmody,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With music ravishing,—sweet melody.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The priestess leads for them the holy hymn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus sing they, measure keep with body, limb:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  [3]"Let length of days, long lasting years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With sword of power, extend his holy life!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With years extended full of glory, shine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Pre-eminent above all kings in strife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Oh, clothe our king, our lord, with strength divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Who with such gifts to gods appears!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  "Let his great empire's limits be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now vast and wide, enlarged, and may he reign</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (Till it shall spread before his eyes complete)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Supreme above all kings! May he attain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To silver hairs, old age, and nations greet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Our sovereign in his royalty!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  "When gifts are ended of Life's days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The feasts of the Land of the Silver Sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With bliss, the Blest Abode Refulgent Courts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    May he enjoy through all eternity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where Light of Happy Fields with joy transports</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And dwell in life eternal, holy there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In presence of the gods with sacred cheer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  With Assur's gods walk blessèd ways!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When they have ended all their joyful song,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They gratefully around their monarch throng;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kneeling at his feet, they bathe his hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With tears of joy, and kiss the 'broidered bands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of his bright robes, then joyous haste away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Erech's shame was ended on that day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now the Sar as his libation pours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sparkling sacred wine before the doors</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That lead to Ishtar's glorious inner shrine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He bows before her golden form divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus prays:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            [4]"In thy fair shrine I bow to thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Light of Heaven! bright thy majesty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As glowing flames upon the world doth dawn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bright goddess of the earth, thy fixed abode!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who dawned upon the earth a glorious god!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With thee prosperity hath ever gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To gild the towers of cities of mankind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou warrior's god, who rideth on the wind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As a hyena fierce thou sendest war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And as a lion comes thy raging car.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each day thou rulest from thy canopy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That spreads above in glory,—shines for thee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O come, exalted goddess of the Sun!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[5]Against the tyrant King I go to war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Attend mine arms, O Queen! with radiant car</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of battles! ride upon the giant King</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With thy bright, fiery chargers! valor bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To me at rising of the glistening car</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Samas, send attendants fierce of war!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But goddess Mam-nutu of Fate and Death;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, keep away from me her blasting breath;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let Samas fix the hour with favor thine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er mine unknown path, Oh ride divine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy servant strengthen with thy godly power</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That he invincible in war may tower,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against thy chosen city's greatest foe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who brought on Erech all her deepest woe."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the inner shrine with curtains hung,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Oracle of Ishtar sweetly sung:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "O King of vast unnumbered countries, hear!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thine enemy Khum-baba do not fear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My hands will waft the winds for thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Thus I reveal!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Khum-baba falls! thine enemy!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Nor aught conceal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "The harvest month[6] propitious shines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Array great Accad's battle lines!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Before thy feet thy Queen descends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Before thy will thine Ishtar bends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To fight thine enemy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To war I go with thee!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My word is spoken, thou hast heard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For thee, my favor thou hast stirred.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As I am Ishtar of mine Or divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thine enemy shall fall! Be glory thine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "Before mine Izdubar I go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And at thy side direct thy blow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I go with thee, fear not, my King,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For every doubt and fear, I bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Relief, to thy heart rest!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Of Sars, I love thee best!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: The account given by Herodotus of the worship of Beltis or
Ishtar, if true (see Herodotus, i. 199), was one of the darkest features
of Babylonian religion. It is probable that the first intention was only
to represent love as heaven-born, and that it afterward became sensual in
the time of Herodotus. (See Sayce's edition Smith's "C.A. of Gen.," p.
50.) The presence of the women may have been intended at first to present
an innocent attraction. See also Rawlinson's "Ancient Monarchies," vol.

<p><strong>THE KING GOES FROM ISHTAR'S TEMPLE TO THE TEMPLE OF SAMAS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He rose and raised the pendant mystic charms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kissed them, and the jewels of her arms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ornaments upon her breast divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then her crown with jewels iridine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He placed upon his brow, and it returned;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the shrine in reverence he turned;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Samas' temple all the chiefs of war</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seers, <emphasis>pa-te-si,</emphasis> go with Izdubar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Before the fire he stands where holy burns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The flames of Samas. In a vase he turns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The crimson wine, to Samas, God, he pours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Libation, and his favor thus implores:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"O Samas, why hast thou established, raised</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Me in thy heart?—protected? Men have praised</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee, Holy One! my expedition bless</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In thine own will, O God, I acquiesce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I go, O Samas, on a path afar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against Khumbaba I declare this war;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The battle's issue thou alone dost know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or if success attends me where I go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The way is long, O may thy son return</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the vast pine-tree forest, I would earn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Erech glory and renown! Destroy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba and his towers! he doth annoy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All nations, and is evil to thy sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To-morrow I will go, O send thy Light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon my standards, and dark Nina-zu</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Keep thou away, that I may wary view</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mine enemies, and fix for me the hour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I shall strike and crush Khumbaba's power.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            To all the gods I humbly pray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To Izdubar propitious be!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            [1]<emphasis>Assur Samas u Marduk-u,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

            Ana Sar bel-ni-ya lik-ru-bu!"</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And thus the Oracle with sweetest voice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him replied, and made his heart rejoice:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          "Fear not, O Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For I am Bel, thy strength in war.[2]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A heart of strength give I to thee!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To trust, we can but faithful be!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          As thou hast shown to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The sixty gods, our strongest ones,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Will guide thy path where'er it runs;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The moon-god on thy right shall ride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And Samas on thy left shall guide.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The sixty gods thy will commands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To crush Khumbaba's bands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In man alone, do not confide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Thine eyes turn to the gods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Who rule from their abodes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And trust in Heaven where powers abide!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>With joyous heart the Sar comes from the shrine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bathe his brow in Samas' rays divine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the pyramid he stands and views</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The scene below with its bright varied hues.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A peerless pile the temple grandly shone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With marble, gold, and silver in the sun;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In seven stages rose above the walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With archways vast and polished pillared halls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A marble portico surrounds the mass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With sculptured columns, banisters of brass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And winding stairways round the stages' side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grand temples piled on temples upward glide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A mass of colors like the rainbow hues,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus proudly rise from breezy avenues.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The brazen gates lead to the temple's side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The stairs ascend and up the stages glide.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The basement painted of the darkest blue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is passed by steps ascending till we view</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From them the second stage of orange hue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And crimson third! from thence a glorious view—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A thousand turrets far beneath, is spread</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er lofty walls, and fields, and grassy mead;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The golden harvests sweep away in sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And orchards, vineyards, on the left and right;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Euphrates' stream as a broad silver band</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sweeps grandly through the glowing golden land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till like a thread of silver still in sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It meets the Tigris gleaming in the light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That spreads along the glorious bending skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The brightest vault of all the emperies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now rested from the cushioned seats we rise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to the stairway turn again our eyes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fourth stage plated o'er with beaten gold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We pass, and topaz fifth till we behold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sixth of azure blue; to seventh glide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That glows with silvery summit where reside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods, within a shrine of silvery sheen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which brightly glows, and from afar is seen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without the temple, burnished silver shines;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within, pure gold and gems in rare designs.</p>

<p><strong>EXPEDITION AGAINST KHUMBABA, AND BATTLE IN THE BLACK FOREST</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At early dawn the shining ranks are massed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Erech echoes with the trumpet's blast;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The chosen men of Erech are in line,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ishtar in her car above doth shine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The blazing standards high with shouts are raised,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As Samas' car above grand Sumir blazed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The march they sound at Izdubar's command,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus they start for King Khumbaba's land;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods in bright array above them shine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By Ishtar led, with Samas, moon-god Sin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On either side with Merodac and Bel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ninip, Nergal, Nusku with his spell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sixty gods on chargers of the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ishtar's chariot before them flies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Across Cazina's desert far have come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The armies now have neared Khumbaba's home;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath grand forests of tall cedar, pine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the dark shades near Khar-sak's brow divine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A brazen gate before them high appeared,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And massive walls which their great foe had reared;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mighty gates on heavy pivots hung,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They broke, and on their brazen hinges swung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With clanging roars against the solid wall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sent through all the wilds a clarion call.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within his halls Khumbaba is enthroned,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In grand Tul-Khumba's walls by forests zoned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With her bright palaces and templed shrines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sanctuaries of the gods, where pines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sigh on the wafting winds their rich perfumes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where Elam's god with sullen thunder dooms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Kharsak's brow the wailing nation's round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Elam's hosts obey the awful sound.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The giant here his castled city old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had strengthened, wrung his tributes, silver, gold;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His palace ceiling with pure silver shines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on his throne of gold from Magan's[1] mines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In all his pride the conqueror exults,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With wealth has filled his massive iron vaults.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oft from his marble towers the plains surveys,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sees his foes' most ancient cities blaze;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While his <emphasis>pa-te-si</emphasis> lead his allied hosts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er his famous victories he boasts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>With Rimsin he allied when Erech fell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King of Sarsa, whose great citadel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was stormed by Nammurabi the great Sar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ninrad of Erech, our King Izdubar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba's ally was by him o'erthrown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus appeared to take Khumbaba's throne.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now within his palace came a sound</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That roared through all the forest, shook the ground:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Our foes! our foes! the gate! hear how it rings!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from his throne the giant furious springs:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Ho! vassals! sound the trump! 'tis Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To arms! our foes are on us from afar!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His weapons seizes, drives his men in fear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before him with his massive sword and spear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And as a tempest from his lips he pours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His orders, while his warrior steed he spurs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Along his serried lines of bristling spears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Among the pines the army disappears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The men of Accad now in squadrons form,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arrayed to take Khumbaba's towers by storm;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While Izdubar the forest black surveyed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of pines and cedars thickly grown, and made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A reconnoitre of his hidden foe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The road was straight; afar the turrets glow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Samas' light, and all the gods arrayed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ride o'er the pines and flash through their dark shade.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The glorious blaze of Accad's glistening spears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One <emphasis>kaspu</emphasis> pass, and now the foe appears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the deepest shadows of the pines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba stands with solid battle lines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the marching host of Izdubar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The forest echoes with the shouts of war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As they sweep on with ringing battle cries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now loudly echoed from the woods and skies:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"<emphasis>Kar-ro! kar-ra!</emphasis>[2] we follow Izdubar!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And through the forests fly the bolts of war.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The foe beheld the gods in wrath above,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Accad's charging lines toward them move,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But bravely stand to meet the onset fierce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their mailed armor, shields, no arrows pierce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now in direst conflict meet the mass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And furious still meets ringing bronze and brass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba on his mighty steed of war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above the ranks towers high a giant Sar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweeps the men of Accad with his blade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till to his breast a heap of corpses made,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fiercely urged his men to fight, to die;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar, with helmet towering high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His men has led with fury on the foe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And massacres each man with one fell blow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who dares to stand in front with sword or spear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fighting by him stands his valiant seer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods now rushing from the gleaming sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With blazing weapons carry victory;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The foe no longer stand before the sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shouting fly away in wild affright.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their monarch turned and slowly rode away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Accad's hosts his men pursue and slay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until the forest deep resounds with cries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To save himself each man in terror flies.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>HAND-TO-HAND CONFLICT OF THE RIVAL GIANTS—DEATH OF KHUMBABA</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now the black forest through, the Sar and seer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sought for their foe, Khumbaba, far and near;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But he had fled when he beheld the gods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In fury rushing from their bright abodes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now from the battle-field the King and seer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The farthest limit of the forest near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And passing on, the Sar thus to his seer:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"The gods have filled our foeman's heart with fear;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He comes not forth to meet us 'neath his walls."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But lo! within their sight, far from his halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba stands beside his steed of snow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Held by his queen, and eyes his coming foe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani cries: "Behold the enemy!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with his queen from us disdains to fly!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar turned to Heabani, said:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"My seer, methought this King from us had fled;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His army slain or scattered from us fly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But by our hands this monarch here must die."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani eyed Khumbaba, nor replied</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the Queen, who wrung her hands and cried;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar continued:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                       "He, of war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It seems, doth lack in skill, and from afar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He scents the battle, while his fighting men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their raids oft make, and here return again;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His castle we may enter without fear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thou his queen mayst have who standeth here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now we end the reign of Elam's throne;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So lend thy hand to strike this monarch prone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My friend, if I mistake thee not, for war</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou art prepared, since thou upon the car</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wast wont to ride in former years now gone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if he falls, a feast day of the Sun</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

[1]We will appoint, and may the birds of prey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Surround his carcass on this glorious day:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But stay! this giant I will slay alone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Although his weight is many <emphasis>gur-ri</emphasis>[2] stone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This giant's form the gods have surely made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An enemy well worthy of my blade."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And Izdubar upon his foe advanced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who waiting stood, and at him fiercely glanced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And naught replied; but raised his glory blade.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their furious glance, the giant's queen dismayed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She wildly eyed the rivals towering high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And breathless stood, then quickly turned to fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As Izdubar upon his heavy shield</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Received Khumbaba's stroke, and then doth wield</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His massive blade as lightning o'er his head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He strikes the giant's helmet on the mead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba, furious, strikes a mighty blow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which staggers Izdubar, who on his foe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now springs and rains upon him faster blows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until his blade with fire continuous glows.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba caught his blows on sword and shield</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With parries; thrusts returned, and naught would yield;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus they fought, the peerless kings of war.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now Ishtar downward drove his raging car,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in Khumbaba's eyes her rays she cast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The giant turned his glance—it was his last;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unwary caught, his foe has swung his sword,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba's gory head rolls o'er the sward.</p>

Wide opens Heaven's joy for man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Iz-zu-bar-ili the great,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who rules from Khar-sak to the main.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the entrance to the royal rooms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Queen Ishtar with her train in splendor comes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her radiant form with glistening gems ablaze,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shining crescent with its glorious rays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Glow with bright Heaven's unremitting flame;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus came the Queen of Love of godly fame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The richest robe of gods her form enshrines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With every charm of Heaven and earth she shines;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of their wide splendors robs the farthest skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That she with love her hero may surprise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her train she robes with liveries of Heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To her are all the dazzling splendors given.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The glittering court is filled with chiefs and seers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When Ishtar at the entrance now appears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Ner-kalli,[5] her heralds at the door,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As some grand sovereign from a foreign shore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The goddess proudly enters with her train,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The spirits of the earth, and tossing main,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From mountains, rivers, woods, and running streams;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And every spirit where the sunlight gleams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now fill the courts and palaces and halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thousands glowing bright surround the walls;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each wafting wind brings I-gi-gi[6] that soar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above An-un-na-ci from every shore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And herald Ishtar's presence, Queen of Love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With music through the halls, around, above.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From lyres and lutes their softest wooings bring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As Ishtar bows before her lover king.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A halo from the goddess fills the halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shines upon the dazzling jewelled walls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Sar and seers in wonder were amazed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At the sweet strains, and glorious light that blazed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Transfixed in silence stood, as she now spoke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweeter music through the palace woke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like fragrant zephyrs, warbling from retreats</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of gardens of the gods, she thus entreats</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Izdubar her welcome, or a glance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of love; and she the Sar would thus entrance:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thy wisdom, Sar, surpasses all mankind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In thee, O king! no blemish do I find.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Queen of Heaven favor seeks from thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I come with love, and prostrate bend the knee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My follies past, I hope thou wilt forgive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alone I love thee, with thee move and live;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart's affections to thee, me have led,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To woo thee to thine Ishtar's marriage bed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O kiss me, my beloved! I adore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee! Hear me! I renounce the godly shore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all its hollow splendor where as queen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I o'er the heavenly hosts, unrivaled reign</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In grandest glory on my shining throne;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet for thee my heart here pines alone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot live without my Izdubar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My husband's love and simple word shall far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Surpass the godly bond. O let me, king,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rest on thy breast, and happiness will cling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all the blissful days which shall be thine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With glory of the skies, my love shall shine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Izdubar, my king! this love below</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is grander here than mortals e'er can know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this I leave my throne in yonder skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And at the feet of love thy queen now lies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, let me taste with thee the sweets of love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I my love for thee will grandly prove,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thou shalt ride upon a diamond car,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lined with pure gold; and jeweled horns of war</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall stud it round like rays of Samas' fire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rich gifts whate'er my lover shall desire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy word shall bring to thee, my Sar-dan-nu!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lo! all the wealth that gods above can view,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I bring to thee with its exhaustless store.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, come my love! within the halls, where more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than I have named is found, all, all is thine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, come with me within our halls divine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Amid the fragrant odors of the pines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all shrubs and flowers, vines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Euphrates' <emphasis>zir-ri</emphasis> there shall sing for thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And dance around thy feet with zi-mu-ri[7]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kings and lords and princes I will bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bow to thee, beloved, glorious king!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With tribute from the mountains and the plains,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As offerings to thee. Thy flocks shall twins</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bring forth; and herds of fattened, lowing kine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall fast increase upon the plains divine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy warrior steeds shall prance with flowing manes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Resistless with thy chariot on the plain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Vast spoils, thy beasts of burden far shall bear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unrivaled then shall be my king of war;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And victory o'er all, thine eyes shall view,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And loud acclaims shall rend the bright Samu."</p>

<p>

The cup of poison shall thy lovers see.</p>

Thou sawest me within a haunt away</p>

From men. I lingered on that direful day,</p>

Or <emphasis>zi-ar-i-a</emphasis> or a <emphasis>zi-lit-tu</emphasis>[2]</p>

As <emphasis>zi-cur-un-i,</emphasis> spirit of the wine,</p>

Thou didst deceive me with thine arts refined,</p>

And love escaped upon the passing wind.</p>

Then to my palace come, and me there seek;</p>

Then as a skulking foe, a mystic spell</p>

Returned with broken spirit, drooping head.</p>

<p>Before the throne of Anu, Ishtar cries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Anatu, the sovereigns of the skies:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O Sar, this king my beauty doth despise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My sweetest charms beholds not with his eyes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Anu to his daughter thus replied:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"My daughter, thou must crush his vaunting pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he will claim thy beauty and thy charms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gladly lie within thy glorious arms."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I hate him now, O Sar, as I did love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against the strength of Anu let him prove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His right divine to rule without our aid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the strength of Anu let him bleed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon this giant Sar so filled with pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let Anu's winged bull[1] in fury ride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will aid the beast to strike him prone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till he in death shall breathe his dying groan."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Anu said: "If thou to it shall join</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy strength, which all thy noble names define</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy glories[2] and thy power thus magnified,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will humble him, who has thy power defied,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ishtar thus: "By all my might as queen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of war and battles, where I proudly reign,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This Sar my hands shall strike upon the plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And end his strength and all his boastings vain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By all the noble names with gods I hold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As queen of war, this giant monarch bold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who o'er mine ancient city thinks to reign,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall lie for birds of prey upon the plain.</p>

For answering my love for thee with scorn,</p>

Proud monarch! from thy throne thou shalt be torn!"</p>

And Erech's <emphasis>masari</emphasis> rush in affright</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Izdubar, who sits upon his throne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before him fall in speechless terror prone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A louder roar now echoes from the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Erech's Sar without the palace flies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He sees the monster light upon the plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And calls Heabani with the choicest men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Erech's spearsmen armed, who fall in line</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without the gates, led by their Sar divine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now the monster rushed on Izdubar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who meets it as the god of chase and war.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With whirling sword before the monster's face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He rains his blows upon its front of brass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And horns, and drives it from him o'er the plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now with spreading wings it comes again,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With maddened fury; fierce its eyeballs glare.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It rides upon the monarch's pointed spear;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The scales the point have turned, and broke the haft.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then as a pouncing hawk when sailing daft,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In swiftest flight o'er him drops from the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But from the gleaming sword it quickly flies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Three hundred warriors now nearer drew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To the fierce monster, which toward them flew;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into their midst the monster furious rushed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And through their solid ranks resistless pushed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To slay Heabani, onward fought and broke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two lines and through the third, which met the shock</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With ringing swords upon his horns and scales.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last the seer it reaches, him impales</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With its sharp horns: but valiant is the seer—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He grasps its crest and fights without a fear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The monster from his sword now turns to fly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani grasps its tail, and turns his eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Towards his king, while scudding o'er the plain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So quickly has it rushed and fled amain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That Izdubar its fury could not meet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But after it he sprang with nimble feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heabani loosed his grasp and stumbling falls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to his king approaching, thus he calls:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That flash with fire along the roaring skies,</p>

His foot; he raised his gory sword on high,</p>

<p><strong>THE CURSE OF ISHTAR, AND REJOICING OF ERECH OVER THE VICTORY</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The monarch and his seer have cleft the head</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Anu's bull prone lying on the mead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They now command to bring it from the plain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the city where they view the slain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The heart they brought to Samas' holy shrine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before him laid the offering divine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without the temple's doors the monster lays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ishtar o'er the towers the bulk surveys;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She spurns the carcass, cursing thus, she cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Woe! woe to Izdubar, who me defies!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My power has overthrown, my champion slain;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Accursèd Sar! most impious of men!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heabani heard the cursing of the Queen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the carcass cleft the tail in twain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before her laid it; to the goddess said:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"And wherefore comest thou with naught to dread?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since I with Izdubar have conquered thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou hearest me! Before thee also see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thine armored champion's scales! thy beast is dead,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ishtar from his presence furious fled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to her maids the goddess loudly calls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Joy and Seduction from the palace halls;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er her champion's death she mourning cries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And flying with her maids, sped to the skies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>King Izdubar his summons sends afar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To view the monster slain by Erech's Sar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The young and old the carcass far surround,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And view its mighty bulk upon the ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The young men eye its horns with wild delight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And weigh them on the public scales in sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Erech. "Thirty <emphasis>manehs</emphasis> weighs!" they cry;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Of purest <emphasis>zamat</emphasis> stone, seems to the eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In substance, with extremities defaced."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Six <emphasis>gurri</emphasis> weighed the monster's bulk undressed.</p>
<empty-line/>

As food for Lugul-turda, their Sar's god,</p>

<p>

The beast is severed, placed upon the wood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Piled high upon the altar o'er the fires.</p>

Of their great monarch, chanting thus his praise,</p>

While Erech's band their liveliest marches play:</p>

Grand banquets far are spread within the walls,</p>

And sparkling rarest wines each freely drank,</p>

And revels ruled the hour till Samas sank,</p>

And Samas sleeps with Hea 'neath the main.</p>

The jewelled lamps are lit within the halls,</p>

<p><strong>ISHTAR WEAVES A MYSTIC SPELL OVER THE KING AND SEER, AND VANISHES—THE
SEER ADVISES THE KING TO SEEK THE AID OF THE IMMORTAL SEER WHO ESCAPES
FROM THE FLOOD.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The goddess Ishtar wrapped in darkness waits</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until the goddess Tsil-at-tu[1] the gates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of sleep has closed upon the darkened plain;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then lightly to the palace flies the Queen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er the King's couch she weaves an awful dream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While her bright eyes upon him furious gleam.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then o'er Heabani's couch a moment stands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Heaven's curtains pulls aside with hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of mystic power, and he a vision sees—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods in council;—vanishing, she flees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without the palace like a gleam of light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wakes the guard around in wild affright.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Next day the seer reveals to Izdubar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How all the gods a council held of war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gave to Anu power to punish them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thus defying Ishtar's godly claim;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus the seer gave him his counsel, well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Considered, how to meet their plottings fell:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"To Khasisadra go, who from the flood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Escaped when o'er the earth the waters stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above mankind, and covered all the ground;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He at the river's mouth may yet be found.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For his great aid, we now the seer must seek,</p>
<empty-line/>

For Anu's fury will upon us break.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Immortal lives the seer beside the sea;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through Hades pass, and soon the seer mayst see."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Thus Izdubar replied, and him embraced:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"With thee, Heabani, I my throne have graced;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With thee I go, mine own companion dear,</p>
<empty-line/>

And on the road each other we may cheer,"</p>

"The way is long, my King, and if I live,</p>

With thee I go, but oh, thou must not grieve,</p>

For perils great attend the way, and old</p>

My heart is ready, but I fear, my son,</p>

These crippled limbs which Anu's bull hath left</p>

Of my strong vigor, have thy seer bereft.</p>

Thee,—with these wounds; nor strength have I to last</p>

Next morn and leave, while Erech's people cheer</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>To Hades' darkened land, whence none return,</p>

<p>

Queen Ishtar, Sin's great daughter, now doth turn;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Inclined her ear and listened through the void</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That lay beneath of every path devoid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The home of darkness, of the Under-World,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where god Ir-kal-la[1] from the heights was hurled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The land and road from whence is no return,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where light no entrance hath to that dark bourne;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where dust to dust returns, devouring clods;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where light dwells not in Tsil-lat-tus abodes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where sable ravens hovering rule the air;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er doors and bolts dust reigneth with despair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the gates of gloom the Queen now stands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to the keeper Ishtar thus commands:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O keeper of the waters! open wide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy gate, that I through these dark walls may glide;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But if thou open'st not the gate for me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I may enter, shattered thou shalt see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The doors and bolts before thee lying prone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the dust shall rise each skeleton,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fleshless jaws devour all men with thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till death shall triumph o'er mortality."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The keeper to the Princess Ishtar said:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Withhold thy speech! or Allat's fury dread!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To her I go to bid thee welcome here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Allat then the keeper doth appear:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Thy sister Ishtar the dark waters seeks—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Queen of Heaven," thus Allat's fury breaks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"So like an herb uprooted comes this Queen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sting me as an asp doth Ishtar mean?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What can her presence bring to me but hate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth Heaven's Queen thus come infuriate?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ishtar thus replies: "The fount I seek,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where I with Tammuz, my first love, may speak;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And drink its waters, as sweet nectar-wines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Weep o'er my husband, who in death reclines;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My loss as wife with handmaids I deplore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er my dear Tammuz let my teardrops pour."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Allat said, "Go! keeper, open wide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gates to her! she hath me once defied;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bewitch her as commanded by our laws."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To her thus Hades opened wide its jaws.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Within, O goddess! Cutha thee receives!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus Hades' palace its first greeting gives."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He seized her, and her crown aside was thrown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O why, thou keeper, dost thou seize my crown?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Within, O goddess! Allat thee receives!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis thus to thee our Queen her welcome gives."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the next gate he her earrings takes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And goddess Ishtar now with fury shakes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Then why, thou slave, mine earrings take away?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Thus entrance, goddess, Allat bids this day."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At the third gate her necklace next he takes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now in fear before him Ishtar quakes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"And wilt thou take from me my gems away?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Thus entrance, goddess, Allat bids this day."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus he strips the goddess at each gate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of ornaments upon her breast and feet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And arms; her bracelets, girdle from her waist,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her robe next took, and flung the Queen undrest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within a cell of that dark solitude.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last, before Queen Ishtar Allat stood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When she had long remained within the walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Allat mocked her till Queen Ishtar falls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Humiliated on the floor in woe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then turning wildly, cursed her ancient foe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Queen Allat furious to her servant cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Go! Naintar! with disease strike blind her eyes!</p>
<empty-line/>

And strike her side! her breast and head and feet;</p>

<p><strong>EFFECT OF ISHTAR'S IMPRISONMENT IN HADES—LOVE DEPARTS FROM THE EARTH—THE
EARTH'S SOLEMN DIRGE OF WOE.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Ishtar, Queen of Love, from Earth had flown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With her love fled, and left all nature prone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Earth all peace with love then fled amain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In loneliness the bull stalked o'er the plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tossed his drooping crest toward the sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In sadness lay upon the green to die;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On the far kine looked weary and bereaved,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And turned toward the gods, and wondering grieved.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The troubled kine then gravely chewed their cud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hungerless in the rich pastures stood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ass his mate abandoned, fled away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And loveless wives then cursed the direful day;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And loving husbands kiss their wives no more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And doves their cooing ceased, and separate soar;</p>
<empty-line/>

And love then died in all the breasts of men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And strife supreme on earth was reveling then.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The sexes of mankind their wars divide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And women hate all men, and them deride;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And some demented hurl aside their gowns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And queens their robes discard and jewelled crowns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And rush upon the streets bereft of shame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their forms expose, and all the gods defame.</p>

Alas! from earth the Queen of Love has gone,</p>

And spurn from them the hateful thought of love,</p>

An awful thrill now speeds through Hades' doors,</p>

Oh, weep with me dear plants, and flowers, and trees!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! my beauty fading now will die!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, weep, ye stars, for me in every sky!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, Samas, hide thy face! I am undone!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, weep with me Ur-ru,[2] my precious son.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let all your notes of joy, my birds, be stilled;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your mother's heart with dread despair is filled:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Come back, my flowerets, with your fragrant dews;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, all my beauties, with your brightest hues;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come back, my plants and buds and youngling shoots!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within your mother's bosom hide your roots.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, children, children! Love hath fled away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! that life I gave should see this day!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your queen lies dying in her awful woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, why should she from us to Hades go?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Wide Nature felt her woe, and ceased to spring,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And withered buds their vigor lost, and fling</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No more their fragrance to the lifeless air;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fruit-trees died, or barren ceased to bear;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The male plants kiss their female plants no more;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pollen on the winds no longer soar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To carry their caresses to the seed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of waiting hearts that unavailing bleed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until they fold their petals in despair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And dying, drop to earth, and wither there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The growing grain no longer fills its head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fairest fields of corn lie blasted, dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All Nature mourning dons her sad attire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And plants and trees with falling leaves expire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Samas' light and moon-god's soothing rays</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Earth's love no more attracts; recurring days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are shortened by a blackness deep profound</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That rises higher as the days come round.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last their light flees from the darkened skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The last faint gleam now passes, slowly dies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon a blasted world, dread darkness falls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er dying nature, crumbling cities' walls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Volcanoes' fires are now the only light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where pale-faced men collect around in fright;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fearful cries the lurid air they rend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all the gods their wild petitions send.</p>

<p><strong>PAPSUKUL, THE GOD OF HOPE, AND HERALD OF THE GODS, FLIES FROM THE EARTH
AND INTERCEDES FOR THE RELEASE OF ISHTAR, AND HEA GRANTS HIS PRAYER</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>O Hope! thou fleeting pleasure of the mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forever with us stay, our hearts to bind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We cling to thee till life has fled away;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our dearest phantom, ever with us stay!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without thee, we have naught but dread despair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The worst of all our torments with us here;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, come with thy soft pinions, o'er us shine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And we will worship thee, a god divine:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>ignis fatuus</emphasis> of all our skies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That grandly leads us, vanishes and dies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And we are left to grope in darkness here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without a ray of light our lives to cheer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, stay! sweet Love's companion, ever stay!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And let us hope with love upon our way!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We reck not if a phantom thou hast been,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And we repent that we have ever seen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy light on earth to lead us far astray;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forever stay! or ever keep away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Papsukul beheld in man's abodes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The change that spread o'er blasted, lifeless clods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And heard earth's wailing through the waning light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With vegetation passing out of sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the doomed world to Heaven he quickly flies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While from the earth are rising fearful cries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Samas' throne he speeds with flowing tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And of the future dark he pours his fears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Sin, the moon-god, Pap-su-kul now cries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er Ishtar's fate, who in black Hades lies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er Earth's dire end, which with Queen Ishtar dies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Hea he appeals with mournful cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "O Hea, our Creator, God and King!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Queen Ishtar now is lying prone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To Earth, our godly queen again, oh, bring!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I trust thy love, O Holy One!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To all the gods who reign o'er us on high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I pray! thus Hope thine aid implores,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Release our queen! To Hades quickly fly!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Thy Pap-su-kul with faith adores.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "The bull hath left the lowing kine bereaved,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And sulking dies in solitude;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The ass hath fled away, his mates hath grieved,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And women are no more imbued</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With love, and drive their husbands far away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And wives enjoy not their caress;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All peace and love have gone from earth this day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And love on earth knows not its bliss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "The females die through all the living world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Among all beasts, and men, and plants;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All love from them on earth have madly hurled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For blissful love no more each pants;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Samas' light is turned away from Earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And left alone volcanoes' fire;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The land is filled with pestilence and dearth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      All life on earth will soon expire."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Hea heard the solemn chant of Hope,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From his high throne he let his sceptre drop,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cried: "And thus, I rule o'er all mankind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this, I gave them life, immortal mind;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To earth's relief, my herald shall quick go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hear thy prayer, and song of Ishtar's woe."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Go! At-su-su-namir, with thy bright head!</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Towards the gates of Hades, turn thy face!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And quickly fly for me through yonder space.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before thy presence may the seven gates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Hades open with their gloomy grates;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May Allat's face rejoice before thy sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her rage be soothed, her heart filled with delight;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But conjure her by all the godly names,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fearless be,—towards the roaring streams</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Incline thine ear, and seek the path there spread.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Release Queen Ishtar! raise her godly head!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sprinkle her with water from the stream;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her purify! a cup filled to the brim</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Place to her lips that she may drink it all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The herald as a meteor doth fall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With blazing fire disparts the hanging gloom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around the gates of that dark world of doom."</p>

<p><strong>RELEASE OF ISHTAR—HER ATTEMPTS TO BRING TO LIFE TAMMUZ, HER FIRST LOVER</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Allat saw the flaming herald come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And his bright light dispelling all her gloom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She beat her breast; and at him furious foams</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In rage, and stamping shakes all Hades' domes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus cursed the herald, At-su-su-namir:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Away! thou herald! or I'll chain thee here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In my dark vaults, and throw thee for thy food</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The city's garbage, which has stagnant stood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With impure waters for thy daily drink,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lodge thee in my prison till you sink</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From life impaled in yonder dismal room</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of torture; to thy fate so thou hast come?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thine offspring with starvation I will strike!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At last obedient doth Allat speak:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Go, Namtar! and the iron palace strike!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er Asherim[1] adorned let the dawn break!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seat the spirits on their thrones of gold!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let Ishtar Life's bright waters then behold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And drink her fill, and bring her then to me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From her imprisonment, I send her free."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Namtar then goes through the palace walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And flings the light through all the darkened halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And places all the spirits on their thrones,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Leads Ishtar to the waters near the cones.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She drinks the sparkling water now with joy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which all her form doth cleanse and purify.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he at the first gate her robe returns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And leads her through the second; where he turns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gives her bracelets back;—thus at each door</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Returns to her her girdle, gems; then o'er</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her queenly brow he placed her shining crown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all her ornaments that were her own,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She stands with pride before the seventh gate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Namtar bows to her in solemn state:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thou hast no ransom to our queen here paid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thy deliverance, yet thou hast said</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy Tammuz thou didst seek within our walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Turn back! and thou wilt find him in these halls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bring him back to life the waters pour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon him; they thy Tammuz will restore;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With robes thou mayst adorn him and a crown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of jewels, and thy maid with thee alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall give thee comfort and appease thy grief.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Kharimtu, Samkha come to thy relief!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now Ishtar lifts her eyes within a room</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prepared for her, and sees her maidens come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before a weird procession wrapped in palls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That soundless glide within and fills the halls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before her now they place a sable bier</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the fount; and Ishtar, drawing near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Raised the white pall from Tammuz's perfect form.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The clay unconscious, had that mystic charm</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Beauty sleeping sweetly on his face,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of agony or sorrow left no trace:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, oh! that awful wound of death was there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With its deep mark;—the wound, and not the scar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Ishtar's eyes beheld it, all her grief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Broke forth afresh, refusing all relief;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She smote her breast in woe, and moaning cried,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor the bright waters to his wound applied:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O Tammuz! Tammuz! turn thine eyes on me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy queen thou didst adorn, before thee see!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold the emeralds and diamond crown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou gavest me when I became thine own!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! he answers not: and must I mourn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forever o'er my love within this bourne?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, oh! the waters from this glowing stream!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps those eyes on me with love will beam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I shall hear again his song of love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, quickly let these waters to me prove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their claim to banish death with magic power!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then with her maids, she o'er his form doth pour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sparkling drops of life—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    "He moves! he lives!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What happiness is this my heart receives?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O come, my Tammuz! to my loving arms!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And on breast his breathing form she warms;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With wondering eyes he stares upon his queen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And nestling closed his eyes in bliss again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: "Asherim," literally "stone stakes" or "cones," the symbols
of the goddess Asherah or Ishtar (Sayce), but Calmet says that the god
Ashima is a deity of very uncertain origin, and that the name "Ashima" may
be very well compared with the Persian "asuman" ("heaven"); in "Zend,"
"acmano," so Gesenius in his Man. Lex., 1832. This also, according to the
magi, is the name of the angel of death, who separates the souls of men
from their bodies, Cal. Dic., p. 106. Cones are to be seen in the British
Museum which are probably of the character which represented Elah-Gabalah,
the sun-god, adored in Rome during the reign of Heliogabalus. The symbol

<empty-line/>
<p>But see! they pass from those dark gates and walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fly upon the breeze from Hades' halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hark! hark! the sounding harp is stilled! it falls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Tammuz's hands! Oh, how its wailing calls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To you bright <emphasis>zi-ni</emphasis>[1] flying through the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See! one sweet spirit of the wind swift flies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And grasps the wailing harp before it ends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Its wail of woe, and now beneath it bends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With silent pinions listening to its strings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wild sobbing on the winds;—with wailing rings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The conscious harp, and trembles in her hands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A rush of pinions comes from myriad lands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With moanings sends afar the awful tale,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And mourners brings with every whispering gale.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! the queen's companion fainting sinks!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She lays him on that cloud with fleecy brinks!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And oh! his life is ebbing fast away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She wildly falls upon his breast, and gray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her face becomes with bitter agony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She tearless kneels, wrapt in her misery</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now upon his breast she lays her head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With tears that gods, alas! with men must shed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She turning, sobs to her sweet waiting maids,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who weeping o'er her stand with bended heads:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Assemble, oh, my maids, in mourning here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods! and spirits of the earth bring near!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>They come! they come! three hundred spirits high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The heavenly spirits come! the I-gi-gi!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From Heaven's streams and mouths and plains and vales,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gods by thousands on the wings of gales.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The spirits of the earth, An-un-na-ci,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now join around their sisters of the sky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hark! hear her weeping to the heavenly throng,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Imploring them to chant their mournful song:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"With your gold lyres, the dirge, oh, sing with me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And moan with me, with your sweet melody;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With swelling notes, as zephyrs softly wail,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cry with me as sobbing of the gale.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Earth! dear Earth! oh, wail with thy dead trees!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With sounds of mountain torrents, moaning seas!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And spirits of the lakes, and streams, and vales,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Zi-ku-ri of mountains' trackless trail,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Join our bright legions with your queen! Oh, weep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With your sad tears, dear spirits of the deep!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let all the mournful sounds of earth be heard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The breeze hath carried stored from beast and bird;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Join the sweet notes of doves for their lost love</p>
<empty-line/>

To the wild moans of hours,—wailing move;</p>
<empty-line/>

Let choirs of Heaven and of the earth then peal,</p>

All living beings my dread sorrow feel!</p>

<p>Ten thousand times ten thousand now in line,</p>
<empty-line/>

In all the panoplies of gods divine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A million crowns are shining in the light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A million sceptres, robes of purest white!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ten thousand harps and lutes and golden lyres</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are waiting now to start the Heavenly choirs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And lo! a chariot from Heaven comes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While halves rise from yonder sapphire domes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A chariot incrusted with bright gems,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A blaze of glory shines from diadems.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

See! in the car the queen o'er Tammuz bends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And nearer the procession slowly wends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her regal diadem with tears is dimmed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And her bright form by sorrow is redeemed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sweeter, holier beauty in her woe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her tears a halo form and brighter flow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Caparisoned with pearls, ten milk-white steeds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are harnessed to her chariot that leads;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On snow-white swans beside her ride her maids,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They come! through yonder silver cloudy glades!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behind her chariot ten sovereigns ride;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behind them comes all Heaven's lofty pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On pale white steeds, the chargers of the skies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The clouds of snowy pinions rustling rise!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But hark! what is that strain of melody</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That fills our souls with grandest euphony?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hear how it swells and dies upon the breeze!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To softest whisper of the leaves of trees;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then sweeter, grander, nobler, sweeping comes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like myriad lyres that peal through Heaven's domes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, oh! how sad and sweet the notes now come!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like music of the spheres that softly hum;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It rises, falls, with measured melody,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With saddest notes and mournful symphony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From all the universe sad notes repeat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With doleful strains of woe transcendent, sweet;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hush! hear the song! my throbbing heart be still!</p>

      With grace and mercy help us bear</p>
<empty-line/>

    Our loss and hers; our weeping queen, oh, see!</p>

      And drop with us a sister's tear.</p>

    Before your eyes our brother slain! oh, view;</p>

    Oh, weep with us o'er him so true;</p>

<p>

        Ah, me, his sister!</p>

      Oh, weep, ye clouds, for my dead love!</p>

    And all my heavenly flowerets for me weep,</p>

        Ah, me, his queen!</p>

      My heart is left a fearful dearth.</p>
<empty-line/>

    Alas, from me all joy! all joy! hath gone;</p>

<p><strong>THE KING AND SEER CONVERSING ON THEIR WAY TO KHASI-SADRA—INTERPRETATION
OF THE KING'S DREAM IN THE PALACE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FESTIVAL</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The dream, my seer, which I beheld last night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within our tent, may bring to us delight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw a mountain summit flash with fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That like a royal robe or god's attire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Illumined all its sides. The omen might</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some joy us bring, for it was shining bright."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus the Sar revealed to him his dream.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heabani said, "My friend, though it did seem</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Propitious, yet, deceptive was it all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And came in memory of Elam's fall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mountain burning was Khumbaba's halls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We fired, when all his soldiers from the walls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had fled;—the <emphasis>ni-takh-garri</emphasis>,[1]—on that morn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of such deceptive dreams, I would thee warn!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Some twenty <emphasis>kaspu</emphasis> they have passed this day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At thirty <emphasis>kaspu</emphasis> they dismount to pray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And raise an altar, Samas to beseech</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That they their journey's end may safely reach.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tent now raised, their evening meal prepare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the forest in the open air;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar brought from the tent the dream</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He dreamed the festal night when Ishtar came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him;—he reads it from a written scroll:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Upon my sight a vision thus did fall:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw two men that night beside a god;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One man a turban wore, and fearless trod.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The god reached forth his hand and struck him down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like mountains hurled on fields of corn, thus prone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He lay; and Izdubar then saw the god</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was Anatu,[2] who struck him to the sod.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The troubler of all men, Samu's fierce queen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus struck the turbaned man upon the plain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He ceased his struggling, to his friend thus said:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'My friend, thou askest not why I am laid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here naked, nor my low condition heed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Accursèd thus I lie upon the mead;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The god has crushed me, burned my limbs with fire.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The vision from mine eyes did then expire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A third dream came to me, which I yet fear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The first beyond my sight doth disappear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A fire-god thundering o'er the earth doth ride;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The door of darkness burning flew aside;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a fierce stream of lightning, blazing fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside me roared the god with fury dire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hurled wide death on earth on every side;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And quickly from my sight it thus did glide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in its track I saw a palm-tree green</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon a waste, naught else by me was seen."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Heabani pondering, thus explained the dream:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"My friend, the god was Samas, who doth gleam</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With his bright glory, power, our God and Lord,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our great Creator King, whose thunders roared</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By thee, as through yon sky he takes his way;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For his great favor we should ever pray.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The man thou sawest lying on the plain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was thee, O King,—to fight such power is vain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus Anatu will strike thee with disease,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unless thou soon her anger shalt appease;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if thou warrest with such foes divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fires of death shall o'er thy kingdom shine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The palm-tree green upon the desert left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doth show that we of hope are not bereft;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods for us their snares have surely weft,[3]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One shall be taken, and the other left."</p>

Our newer life to children with our blood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or if these blessings we should miss; in wood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or glen, or garden, field, or emerald seas,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our forms shall spring again; in such as these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We see around us throbbing with sweet life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In trees or flowerets.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                  This needs no belief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On which to base the fabric of a dream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Earth her children from death doth redeem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And each contributes to continuous bloom;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So go your way! ye sisters, to your gloom!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Far on their road have come the king of fame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seer, within the land of Mas[5] they came,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor knew that Fate was hovering o'er their way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In gentle converse they have passed the day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some twenty <emphasis>kaspu</emphasis> o'er the hills and plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They a wild forest in the mountain gain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In a deep gorge they rode through thickets wild,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the pines; now to a pass they filed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! two dragons[6] near a cave contend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their path! with backs upreared their coils unbend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Extend their ravenous jaws with a loud roar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That harshly comes from mouths of clotted gore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The sky overhead with lowering clouds is cast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which Anu in his rage above them massed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dark tempests fly above from Rimmon's breath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who hovers o'er them with the gods of death;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The wicked seven winds howl wildly round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And crashing cedars falling shake the ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now Tsil-lattu her black wings spreads o'er all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dark shrouding all the forest with her pall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from his steed for safety each dismounts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And o'er their heads now break the ebon founts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But hark! what is that dreadful roaring noise?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The dragons come! Their flaming crests they poise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above, and nearer blaze their eyes of fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! upon them rush the monsters dire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The largest springs upon the giant Sar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who parrying with the sword he used in war,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With many wounds it pierces, drives it back;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again it comes, renews its fierce attack,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fangs outspread its victims to devour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

High o'er the monarch's head its crest doth tower,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Its fiery breath upon his helm doth glow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Exposed its breast! he strikes! his blade drives through</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Its vitals! Dying now it shakes the ground,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And furious lashes all the forest round.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But hark! what is that awful lingering shriek</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cries of woe, that on his ears wild break?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A blinding flash, see! all the land reveals,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With dreadful roars, and darkness quick conceals</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fearful sight, to ever after come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before his eyes, wherever he may roam.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King, alas! too late Heabani drags</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the beast's fangs, that dies beneath the crags</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Overhanging near the cave. And now a din</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Loud comes from <emphasis>dalkhi</emphasis> that around them spin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In fierce delight, while hellish voices rise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In harsh and awful mockery; the cries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of agony return with taunting groans,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And mock with their fell hate those piteous moans.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Amazed stands Izdubar above his seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor hears the screams, nor the fierce <emphasis>dalkhi's</emphasis> jeer;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the flashing lightnings he soon found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The cave, and lays the seer upon the ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His breaking heart now cries in agony,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Heabani! O my seer, thou must not die!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! dread Mam-mitu hath led us here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Awake for me! arouse! my noble seer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would to gods of Erech I had died</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thee! my seer! my strength! my kingdom's pride!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The seer at last revives and turns his face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With love that death touched not, his hand doth place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With friendly clasp in that of his dear king,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And says:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          "Grieve not, beloved friend, this thing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Called death at last must come, why should we fear?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis Hades' mist that opens for thy seer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The gods us brought, nor asked consent, and life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They give and take away from all this strife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That must be here, my life I end on earth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Both joy and sorrow I have seen from birth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Hades' awful land, whence none return,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani's face in sorrow now must turn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My love for thee, mine only pang reveals,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this alone I grieve."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                            A teardrop steals</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Across his features, shining 'neath the light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King has lit to make the cavern bright.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"But oh, friend Izdubar, my King, when I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From this dear earth to waiting Hades fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grieve not; and when to Erech you return,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou shalt in glory reign, and Zaidu learn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As thy companion all that thine own heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Desires, thy throne thou wilt to him impart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The female, Samkha, whom he brought to me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is false, in league with thine own enemy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she will cause thee mischief, seek to drive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee from thy throne; but do not let her live</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the walls of Erech, for the gods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have not been worshipped in their high abodes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When thou returnest, to the temple go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pray the gods to turn from thee the blow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Anu's fury, the strong god, who reigns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above, and sent these woes upon the plains.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His anger raised against thee, even thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Must be allayed, or thy goods thou shalt see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kingdom, all destroyed by his dread power.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Khasisadra will to thee give more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Advice when thou shalt meet the ancient seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For from thy side must I soon disappear."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seer now ceased, and on his couch asleep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Spoke not, and Izdubar alone doth weep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And thus twelve days were past, and now the seer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the great change he saw was drawing near</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Informed his King, who read to him the prayers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And for the end each friendly act prepares,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then said: "O my Heabani, dearest friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would that I thy body could defend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From thy fierce foe that brings the end to thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My friend in battle I may never see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again, when thou didst nobly stand beside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Me; with my seer and friend I then defied</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All foes; and must thou leave thy friend, my seer?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Alas! my King, I soon shall leave thee here."</p>

<p>COLUMN III</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>HEABANI REVEALS TWO WONDERFUL VISIONS TO THE KING, ONE OF DEATH AND
OBLIVION, AND THE OTHER OF HEAVEN, AND DIES IN THE ARMS OF THE KING</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But, oh, my King! to thee I now reveal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A secret that my heart would yet conceal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To thee, my friend, two visions I reveal:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The first I oft have dreamed beneath some spell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of night, when I enwrapped from all the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Self alone communed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                       Unconscious hurled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By winged thought beyond this present life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I seeming woke in a Dark World where rife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was Nothingness,—a darksome mist it seemed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All eke was naught;—no light for me there gleamed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And floating 'lone, which way I turned, saw naught;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor felt of substance 'neath my feet, nor fraught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With light was Space around; nor cheerful ray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of single star. The sun was quenched; or day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or night, knew not. No hands had I, nor feet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor head, nor body, all was void. No heat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or cold I felt, no form could feel or see;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And naught I knew but conscious entity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No boundary my being felt, or had;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And speechless, deaf, and blind, and formless, sad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I floated through dark space,—a conscious blank!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No breath of air my spirit moved; I sank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I knew not where, till motionless I ceased</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last to move, and yet I could not rest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around me spread the Limitless, and Vast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My cheerless, conscious spirit,—fixed and fast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In some lone spot in space was moveless, stark!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An atom chained by forces stern and dark,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With naught around me. Comfortless I lived</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In my dread loneliness! Oh, how I grieved!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus, man's fate in Life and Death is solved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With naught but consciousness, and thus involved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All men in hopes that no fruition have?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this alone was all that death me gave?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That all had vanished, gone from me that life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could give, and left me but a blank, with strife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of rising thoughts, and vain regrets, to float;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away from life and light, be chained remote!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh, how my spirit longed for some lone crag</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To part the gloom beneath, and rudely drag</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My senses back! or with its shock to end</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My dire existence;—to oblivion send</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Me quickly! How I strove to curse, and break</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That soundless Void, with shrieks or cries, to wake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That awful silence which around me spread!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In vain! in vain! all but my soul was dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then my spirit soundless cried within:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Oh, take me! take me back to Earth again!'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For tortures of the flesh were bliss and joy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To such existence! Pain can never cloy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The smallest thrill of earthly happiness!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twas joy to live on earth in pain! I'll bless</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee, gods, if I may see its fields I've trod</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To kiss its fragrant flowers, and clasp the sod</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of mother Earth, that grand and beauteous world!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From all its happiness, alas! was hurled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My spirit,—then in frenzy—I awoke!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great Bel! a dream it was! as vanished smoke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It sped! and I sprang from my couch and prayed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all the gods, and thus my soul allayed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then with blessings on my lips, I sought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My couch, and dropped away in blissful thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In dream the second:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                      "Then the Silver Sky</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Came to me. Near the Stream of Life I lie:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My couch the rarest flowers; and music thrills</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My soul! How soft and sweet it sounds from rills</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And streams, and feathered songsters in the trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Heaven's fruits!—e'en all that here doth please</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The heart of man was there. In a dear spot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I lay, 'mid olives, spices, where was wrought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A beauteous grotto; and beside me near,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were friends I loved; and one both near and dear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With me reclined, in blissful converse, sweet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With tender thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                      Our joy was full, complete!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ministering spirits there had spread</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before us all a banquet on the mead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Heaven's food and nectar for our feast;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And oh, so happy! How our joy increased</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As moments flew, to years without an end!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Courts Refulgent there we oft did wend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Beside a silver lake, a holy fane</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There stood within the centre of the plain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

High built on terraces, with walls of gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where palaces and mansions there enfold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A temple of the gods, that stands within</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Mid feathery palms and <emphasis>gesdin</emphasis>[1] bowers green,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The city rises to a dizzy height,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With jewelled turrets flashing in the light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grand mansions piled on mansions rising high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Until the glowing summits reach the sky.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A cloud of myriad wings, e'er fills the sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As doves around their nests on earth here fly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The countless millions of the souls on earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods have brought to light from mortal birth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are carried there from the dark world of doom;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For countless numbers more there still is room.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through trailing vines my Love and I oft wind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With arms of love around each other twined.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This day, we passed along the Stream of Life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through blooming gardens, with sweet odors rife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the ever-ripening fruits we walk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Along dear paths, and sweetly sing, or talk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While warbling birds around us fly in view,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From bloom to bloom with wings of every hue;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And large-eyed deer, no longer wild, us pass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With young gazelles, and kiss each other's face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We now have reached the stately stairs of gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The city of the gods, here built of old.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The pearled pillars rise inlaid divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With lotus delicately traced with vine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In gold and diamonds, pearls, and unknown gems,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That wind to capital with blooming stems</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of lilies, honeysuckles, and the rose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An avenue of columns in long rows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of varied splendor, leads to shining courts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where skilful spirit hands with perfect arts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have chiselled glorious forms magnificent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With ornate skill and sweet embellishment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their golden sculpture view on every hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or carvèd images in pearl that stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In clusters on the floor, or in long rows;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on the walls of purest pearl there glows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The painting of each act of kindest deed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each soul performs on earth;—is there portrayed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The scenes of tenderness and holy love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There stand and never end, but onward move,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fill the galleries of Heaven with joy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ever spirit artist hands employ.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The holiest deeds are carved in purest gold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or richest gems, and there are stored of old;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the inner court a fountain stood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of purest diamond moulded, whence there flowed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into a golden chalice,—trickling cool,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The nectar of the gods,—a sparkling pool,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That murmuring sank beneath an emerald vase</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That rested underneath;—the fountain's base.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"We entered then an arcade arching long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through saph'rine galleries, and heard the song</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That swelling came from temples hyaline;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And passed through lazite courts and halls divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While dazzling glories brighter round us shone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How sweet then came the strains! with grander tone!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, oh, my King! I reached the gates of pearl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That stood ajar, and heard the joyous whirl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That thrilled the sounding domes and lofty halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And echoed from the shining jasper walls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I stood within the gate, and, oh, my friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before that holy sight I prone did bend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hid my face upon the jacinth stairs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A shining god raised me, and bade my fears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be flown, and I beheld the glorious throne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of crystaled light; with rays by man unknown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The awful god there sat with brows sublime,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With robes of woven gold, and diadem</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That beamed with blazing splendor o'er his head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I thus beheld the god with presence dread,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King of Kings, the Ancient of the Days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While music rose around with joyous praise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With awful thunders how they all rejoice!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sing aloud with one commingled voice!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"What happiness it was to me, my King!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From bower to temple I went oft to sing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or spread my wings above the mount divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And viewed the fields from heights cerulean.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those songs still linger on dear memory's ear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tireless rest upon me, ever cheer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But from the Happy Fields, alas! I woke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from my sight the Heavenly vision broke;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, oh, my King, it all was but a dream!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hope the truth is such, as it did seem;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If it is true that such a Heavenly Land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Exists with happiness so glorious, grand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within that haven I would happy be!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But it, alas! is now denied to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For, oh, my King, to Hades I must go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My wings unfold to fly to Realms of Woe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In darkness to that other world unknown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! from joyous earth my life has flown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Farewell, my King, my love thou knowest well;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I go the road; in Hades soon shall dwell;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To dwelling of the god Irkalla fierce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To walls where light for me can never pierce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The road from which no soul may e'er return,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where dust shall wrap me round, my body urn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where sateless ravens float upon the air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where light is never seen, or enters there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where I in darkness shall be crowned with gloom;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With crownèd heads of earth who there shall come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To reign with Anu's favor or great Bel's,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then sceptreless are chained in their dark cells</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With naught to drink but Hades' waters there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And dream of all the past with blank despair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within that world, I too shall ceaseless moan,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where dwell the lord and the unconquered one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seers and great men dwell within that deep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With dragons of those realms we all shall sleep;</p>
<empty-line/>

Where King Etana[2] and god Ner doth reign</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Allat, the dark Under-World's great queen,</p>

<p>

Who reigns o'er all within her regions lone,</p>

<p>

The Mistress of the Fields, her mother, prone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before her falls, and none her face withstands;</p>

But I will her approach, and take her hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she will comfort me in my dread woe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! through yonder void I now must go!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My hands I spread! as birds with wings I fly!</p>

Descend! descend! beneath that awful sky!"</p>

<p><strong>THE GRIEF OF THE KING OVER THE LOSS OF HIS SEER, AND HIS PRAYER TO THE
MOON-GOD, WHO ANSWERS HIS PRAYER WITH A VISION</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King weeps bitterly with flowing tears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above his seer when from him disappears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The last faint breath; and then in deepest woe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He cries: "And through that desert must I go?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heabani, thou to me wast like the gods;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, how I loved thee! must thou turn to clods?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through that dread desert must I ride alone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And leave thee here, Heabani, lying prone?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas, I leave thee in this awful place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To find our Khasisadra, seek his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The son of Ubara-tutu, the seer;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, how can I, my friend, thus leave thee here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This night through those dark mountains I must go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I can no longer bear this awful woe:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I shall tarry here, I cannot sleep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Sin, bright moon-god, of yon awful deep!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I pray to thee upon my face, oh, hear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My prayer! my supplications bring thou near</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all the gods! grant thou to me,—e'en me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A heart of strength and will to worship thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh, is this death like that the seer hath dreamed?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps the truth then on his spirit gleamed!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If Land of Silver Sky is but a myth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The other dream is true! e'en all he saith!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, tell me, all ye sparkling stars,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That wing above thy glorious flight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And feel not Nature's jars;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But grandly, sweetly fling thy light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To our bright world beneath serene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Hath mortals on thee known</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or viewed beyond,—that great Unseen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their future fate by gods been shown?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Oh, hear me, all ye gods on high!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To gods who love mankind I pray,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Despairing, oh, I cry!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, drive these doubts and fears away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet—and yet, what truths have we?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O wondrous mortal, must thou die?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beyond this end thou canst not see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Life! O Death! O mystery!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"The body still is here, with feeling dead!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sight is gone!—and hearing from his head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor taste, nor smell, nor warmth, nor breath of life!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where is my seer? Perhaps, his spirit rife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

E'en now in nothingness doth wander lone!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In agony his thoughts! with spirit prone!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In dread despair!—If conscious then, O gods!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He spake the truth!—His body to the clods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath turned! By this we feel, or hear, or see,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when 'tis gone,—exist?—in agony!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Hades hath he gone? as he hath thought!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas, the thought is torture, where have wrought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods their fearful curse! Ah, let me think!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Silver Sky? Alas, its shining brink</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He hath not crossed. The wrathful gods deny</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Him entrance! Where, oh, where do spirits fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom gods have cursed? Alas, he is condemned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To wander lone in that dark world, contemned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from the Light of Happy Fields is barred!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, why do gods thus send a fate so hard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cruel? O dear moon-god, moon-god Sin!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My seer hath erred. Receive his soul within</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To joys prepared for gods and men! Though seer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was, he immortality did fear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As some unknown awakening in space.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, turn upon him thy bright blessed face!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was my friend! O moon-god, hear my prayer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Imploring thee, doth pray thine Izdubar!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And lo! a vision breaks before his eyes!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The moon-god hides the shadows of the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweeps above with his soft, soothing light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That streams around his face; he drives the night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before his rays, and with his hands sweet peace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He spreads through all the skies; and Strife doth cease!</p>
<empty-line/>

A girdle spans the Heavens with pure light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That shines around the River of the Night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the circling rays a host appears!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The singers of the skies, as blazing spheres!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hark! Hear their harps and lyres that sweetly sound!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They sing! Oh, how the glowing skies resound!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  "O King of Light and Joy and Peace,</p>

    Supreme thy love shall ever reign;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   Oh, can our songs of bliss here cease?</p>

<p><strong>THE KING BURIES HIS SEER IN THE CAVE, AND CONTINUING HIS JOURNEY, HE MEETS
TWO FIERY GIANTS WHO GUIDE THE SUN IN THE HEAVENS—THEY MAKE MERRY OVER
THE KING, AND DIRECT HIM ON HIS WAY</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King within the cave his seer entombs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And mourning sadly from the cavern comes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The entrance closes with the rocks around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Again upon his journey he is bound.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But soon within the mountains he is lost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the darkness,—as some vessel tost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the trackless waves of unknown seas,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But further from the awful cavern flees.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The morning breaks o'er crags and lonely glens,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he dismayed, the awful wild now scans.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He reins his steed and wondering looks around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sees of every side a mystic ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before him stands the peak of Mount Masu,[1]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The cliffs and crags forlorn his eyes swift view,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cedars, pines, among the rocks amassed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That weirdly rise within the mountain fast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hark! hear that dreadful roaring all around!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What nameless horror thrills the shaking ground?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King in terror stares! and see! his steed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Springs back! wild snorting,—trembling in his dread.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold! behold those forms there blazing bright!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fierce flying by the earth with lurid light;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two awful spirits, demons, or fierce gods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With roaring thunders spring from their abodes!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From depths beneath the earth the monsters fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And upward lift their awful bodies high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet higher!—higher! till their crests are crowned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By Heaven's gates; thus reaching from the ground</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To heights empyrean, while downward falls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each form, extending far 'neath Hades' walls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! each god as molten metal gleams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While sulphurous flame from hell each monster climbs!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two fiery horrors reaching to the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While wrathful lightning from each monster flies!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Hell's gate they guard with Death's remorseless face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hurl the sun around the realms of space</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

E'en swifter than the lightning, while it goes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Along its orbit, guided by their blows.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dire tempests rise above from their dread blows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ever round a starry whirlwind glows;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The countless stars thus driven whirl around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all the circling planets circling round.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King astounded lifts his staring eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into his face gray fear, with terror flies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As they approach, his thoughts the King collects,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus over him one of the gods reflects.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Who cometh yonder with the form of gods?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The second says: "He comes from man's abodes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But with a mortal's feebleness he walks;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold upon the ground alone he stalks."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>One lifts his mighty arm across the sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And strikes the sun as it goes roaring by;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fiery world with whiter heat now glows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While a vast flood of flame behind it flows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That curling, forms bright comets, meteors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And planets multiplies, and blazing stars;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The robe of flames spreads vast across the sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Adorned with starry gems that sparkling fly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the ambient ether forming suns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That through new orbits sing their orisons;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their pealing thunders rend the trembling sky,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The endless anthem of eternity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The monster turning to the King then says,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When nearer now his awful form doth blaze:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"So thus you see, my son, the gods are strong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to provoke great power, is foolish, wrong;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But whither goest thou, thou sad-eyed King,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What message hast thou;—to us here would bring?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King now prostrate to the monsters prayed:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Ye gods or demons, I within your glade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of horrors, have unwilling come to seek</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our Khasisadra, who a spell can make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To turn the anger of the gods away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Immortal lives the seer beside the sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He knoweth death and life, all secret things;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this alone your servant to you brings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The goddess sought my hand, which I denied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Anu's fury thus I have defied;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This all my troubles caused, show me the way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Khasisadra, this I ask and pray."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The god's vast face broke out with wondrous smiles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And laughing, ripples rolled along for miles;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His mouth wide opened its abyss and yawned,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As earthquake gulf, far spreading through the ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His roaring laughter shakes the earth around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Ho! ho! my son! so you at last have found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Queen can hate, as well as love her friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on thy journey Ishtar's love thee sends?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A mortal wise thou wast, to her refuse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For she can do with man what she may choose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A mortal's love, in truth, is wondrous strong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A glorious thing it is, Life's ceaseless song!</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>    Then sing your song of hate, ye fiends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And hurl your pestilential breath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Till every soul before us bends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And worship here the god of Death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    In error still for e'er and aye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      They see not, hear not many things;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The unseen forces do not weigh,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And each an unknown mystery brings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    In error still for e'er and aye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      They delve for phantom shapes that ride</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Across their minds alone,—and they</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But mock the folly of man's pride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    In error still for e'er and aye!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      They learn but little all their lives,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Wisdom ever wings her way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Evading ever,—while man strives!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    But hark! another song rings through the gloom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And, oh, how sweet the music far doth come!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Oh, hear it, all ye souls in your despair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For joy it brings to sorrowing ones e'en here!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "There is a Deep Unknown beyond,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That all things hidden well doth weigh!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On man's blind vision rests the bond</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of error still for e'er and aye!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "But to the mighty gods, oh, turn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For truth to lead you on your way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And wisdom from their tablets learn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And ever hope for e'er and aye!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And see! the hags disperse within the gloom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As those sweet sounds resound within the room;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now a glorious light doth shine around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their rays of peace glide o'er the gloomy ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! 'tis Papsukul, our god of Hope,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With cheerful face comes down the fearful slope</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of rugged crags, and blithely strides to where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our hero stands, amid the poisonous air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And says:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          "Behold, my King, that glorious Light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That shines beyond! and eye no more this sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of dreariness, that only brings despair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For phantasy of madness reigneth here!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King in wonder carefully now eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The messenger divine with great surprise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And says:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          "But why, thou god of Hope, do I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus find thee in these realms of agony?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This World around me banishes thy feet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From paths that welcome here the god of Fate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And blank despair, and loss irreparable.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why comest thou to woe immeasurable?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"You err, my King, for hope oft rules despair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I ofttimes come to reign with darkness here;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I am gone, the god of Fate doth reign;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I return, I soothe these souls again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"So thus you visit all these realms of woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To torture them with hopes they ne'er can know?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Avaunt! If this thy mission is on Earth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or Hell, thou leavest after thee but dearth!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Not so, my King! behold yon glorious sphere,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where gods at last take all these souls from here!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Adieu! thou soon shalt see the World of Light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where joy alone these souls will e'er delight."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The god now vanishes away from sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hero turns his face toward the light;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nine <emphasis>kaspu</emphasis> walks, till weird the rays now gleam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As <emphasis>zi-mu-ri</emphasis> behind the shadows stream.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He sees beyond, umbrageous grots and caves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where odorous plants entwine their glistening leaves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! the trees bright flashing gems here bear!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And trailing vines and flowers do now appear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That spread before his eyes a welcome sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a sweet dream of some mild summer night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, oh! his path leads o'er that awful stream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Across a dizzy arch 'mid sulphurous steam</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That covers all the grimy bridge with slime.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He stands perplexed beside the waters grime,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which sluggish move adown the limbo black,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With murky waves that writhe demoniac,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As ebon serpents curling through the gloom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hurl their inky crests, that silent come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Toward the yawning gulf, a tide of hate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweep their dingy waters to Realms of Fate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He cautious climbs the slippery walls of gloom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And dares not look beneath, lest Fate should come;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He enters now the stifling clouds that creep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around the causeway, while its shadows sleep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the stream that sullen moves below,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He slips!—and drops his torch! it far doth glow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath him on the rocks! Alas, in vain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He seeks a path to bring it back again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It moves! snatched by a <emphasis>dal-khu's</emphasis> hand it flies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away within the gloom, then falling dies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within those waters black with a loud hiss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That breaks the silence of that dread abyss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He turns again, amid the darkness gropes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And careful climbs the cragged, slimy slopes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now he sees, oh, joy! the light beyond!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He springs! he flies along the glowing ground,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And joyous dashes through the waving green</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That lustrous meets his sight with rays serene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where trees pure amber from their trunks distil,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where sweet perfumes the groves and arbors fill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where zephyrs murmur odors from the trees,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweep across the flowers, carrying bees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With honey laden for their nectar store;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where humming sun-birds upward flitting soar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er groves that bear rich jewels as their fruit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That sparkling tingle from each youngling shoot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fill the garden with a glorious blaze</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of chastened light and tender thrilling rays.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He glides through that enchanted mystic world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er streams with beds of gold that sweetly twirled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With woven splendor 'neath the blaze of gems</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That crown each tree with glistening diadems.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sounds of streams are weft with breezes, chant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their arias with trembling leaves,—the haunt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of gods! O how the tinkling chorus rings!—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With rhythms of the unseen rustling wings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of souls that hover here where joy redeems</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Them with a happiness that ever gleams.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The hero stands upon a damasked bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of flowers that glow beneath his welcome tread,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And softly sink with 'luring odors round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And beckon him to them upon the ground.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Amid rare pinks and violets he lies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And one sweet pink low bending near, he eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With tender petals thrilling on its stem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It lifts its fragrant face and says to him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Dear King, wilt thou love me as I do thee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We love mankind, and when a mortal see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We give our fragrance to them with our love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their love for us our inmost heart doth move."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King leans down his head, it kissing, says,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Sweet beauty, I love thee? with thy sweet face?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart is filled with love for all thy kind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would that every heart thy love should find."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fragrant floweret thrills with tenderness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With richer fragrance answers his caress.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He kisses it again and lifts his eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And rises from the ground with glad surprise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And see! the glorious spirits clustering round!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They welcome him with sweet melodious sound.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We hear their golden instruments of praise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As they around him whirl a threading maze;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In great delight he views their beckoning arms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lustrous eyes, and perfect, moving forms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! he seizes one bright, charming girl,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the enchanting ring doth nearer whirl;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He grasps her in his arms, and she doth yield</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The treasure of her lips, where sweets distilled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give him a joy without a taint of guilt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It thrills his heart-strings till his soul doth melt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A kiss of chastity, and love, and fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A joy that few can dare to here aspire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The beauteous spirit has her joy, and flees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all her sister spirits 'neath the trees.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! the <emphasis>gesdin</emphasis>[2] shining stands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With crystal branches in the golden sands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In this immortal garden stands the tree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With trunk of gold, and beautiful to see.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside a sacred fount the tree is placed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With emeralds and unknown gems is graced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus stands, the prince of emeralds,[3] Elam's tree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As once it stood, gave Immortality</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To man, and bearing fruit, there sacred grew,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till Heaven claimed again Fair Eridu.[4]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The hero now the wondrous fountain eyes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Its beryl base to ruby stem doth rise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To emerald and sapphire bands that glow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where the bright curvings graceful outward flow;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around the fountain to its widest part,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The wondrous lazite bands now curling start</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And mingle with bright amethyst that glows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To a broad diamond band,—contracting grows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To <emphasis>uk-ni</emphasis> stone, turquoise, and clustering pearls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Inlaid with gold in many curious curls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of twining vines and tendrils bearing birds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Among the leaves and blooming flowers, that words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May not reveal, such loveliness in art,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fancies spirit hands can only start</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From plastic elements before the eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And mingle there the charms of empery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath two diamond doves that shining glow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the summit, the bright waters flow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With aromatic splendors to the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While glistening colors of the rainbow rise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here ends the tablet,[5] "When the hero viewed</p>

The fountain which within the garden stood."</p>

<p>TABLET VIII—COLUMN I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE KING'S ADVENTURE AT THE GATE OF THE GARDEN OF THE GODS WITH THE TWO
MAIDENS—ONE OF THEM LEADS HIM INTO THE HAPPY HALLS—SONGS OF THE SABITU
AND ZI-SI.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A gate half opened shows the silvery sea</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet distant shining lambent on his way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now he sees young Siduri,[1] whose breast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Infuses life; all nature she hath blest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose lips are flames, her arms are walls of fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose love yields pleasures that can never tire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She to the souls who joy on earth here miss,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grants them above a holier, purer bliss.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maiden sits within a holy shrine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the gate with lustrous eyes divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And beckons to the King, who nearer comes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And near her glows the Happy Palace domes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And lo! 'tis she his lips have fondly kissed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the garden, when like fleeing mist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She disappeared with the bright spirit Seven,[2]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Sabit, who oft glide from earth to Heaven.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! one of the Seven, Sabitu,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Emerging from the gate doth jealous view</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The coming hero who hath kissed her mate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She angry springs within to close the gate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bars it, enters then the inner halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar to her now loudly calls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O Sabitu! what see-est thou, my maid?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Izdubar is Sabitu afraid?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy gate thou barrest thus before my face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Quick, open for me! or I'll force the brass!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maid now frightened opens wide the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Sar and Siduri now tread the floor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the bright palace where sweet joy doth reign.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through crystal halls 'neath golden roofs the twain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Next go within a lofty ceilinged hall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With shining pearled columns, golden wall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And purple silken hangings at each door,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With precious gems inlaid upon the floor;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where couches grand are spread for one to rest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath the softened rays that sweet invest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The senses with a thrill of happiness;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where Siduri with joy all souls doth bless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maid sits on a couch and turns her face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Toward the King with that immortal grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That love to gods and men will e'er bestow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their eyes now mingling with a happy glow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maiden sweetly says: "Where wouldst thou go?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within these Happy Halls we joy but know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And if thou wilt, my King, my heart is thine!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our love will ever bring us bliss divine."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Alas, my maid, thy love to me is dear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sad am I that I must go from here.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I came from Erech by advice from one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I loved more than thou canst e'er know, but gone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From me is my Heabani, faithful seer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Across a desert waste have I come here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he has there to dust returned,—to dust—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O how the love of my friend I did trust!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would that we had never started here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I now must find the great immortal seer."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The maiden turns her glowing eyes on him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Replies: "My King, thou knowest joy may gleam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Take courage, weary heart, and sing a song!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hour of sorrow can never be long;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The day will break, and flood thy soul with joy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And happiness thy heart will then employ!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each day must end with all its sorrow, woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, sing with me, dear heart! I love thee so!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! the curtains flung aside, now comes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The joyous Sabitu from yonder rooms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And gathering round, a song they gayly sing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, how with music the bright walls now ring!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If evil thou hast done, my King,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Oh, pray! oh, pray!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And to the gods thy offerings bring,</p>

<p>

        As fire, as fire!</p>

        With ire, with ire!</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>And lo! young Siduri hath disappeared,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with the Zisi crowned she now appeared;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The corn-gods in a crescent round their queen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She waves before the king her Nusku[3] green,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sings with her sweet voice a joyful lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all the Zisi join the chorus gay:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    [4]A heifer of the corn am I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Kara! Kara![5]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yoked with the kine we gayly fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Kara! Kara!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The ploughman's hand is strong and drives</p>
<empty-line/>

    The glowing soil, the meadow thrives!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Before the oxen</p>

<p>        Before the oxen</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>    The harvesters are in the corn!</p>
<empty-line/>

    Our feet are flying with the morn,</p>

    We bring thee wealth! it is thine own!</p>

<p>        The yellow grain</p>

<p>

    Sa-lum-mat-u na-si.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    The fruit of death, oh, King, taste it not!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Taste not! taste not!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With fruit of Life the land is fraught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Around! around!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The fruit of Life we give to thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And happiness, oh, ever see.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All joy is thine</p>

<p>        All joy is thine</p>

    Through Earth and Heaven's bound.</p>

<p>    Our corn immortal there is high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And ripe! and ripe!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And ever ripens 'neath that sky</p>

<p>

        As gold! as gold!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our corn is bearded,[7] thus 'tis known,</p>

    And ripens quickly when 'tis grown.</p>

        Be joy with thee,</p>

<p>    Our King from us now goes, now goes!</p>

<p>

    His royal robe behind him glows</p>

<p>

        Afar! afar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Across the waves where Hea reigns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The waters swollen he soon gains!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To our great seer,</p>

    He sails to him afar!</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Chorus</emphasis></p>
<p>        To our great seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He sails to him afar!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    And he will reach that glorious land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Away! away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Amid our fruit-trees he will stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That day! that day!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our fruit so sweet the King will eat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nor bitter mingle with the sweet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In our seer's land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That glows afar away!</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Chorus</emphasis></p>
<p>        In our seer's land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That glows afar away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The singing spirits from them fled, and he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alone stood thinking by young Siduri.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King leaned on his bow, and eyed the maid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A happy look came in his eyes,—and fled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For lo! the curtain quick aside is pushed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Sabitu within upon them rushed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She stately glides across the shining floor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And eyes them both, then turns toward the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Izdubar is equal to the task,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With grace now smiling, of the maid doth ask:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O Sabitu! wouldst thou tell me the way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Khasisadra? for I go this day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I the sea may cross, how shall I go?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or through the desert? thou the path mayst know."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maiden startled looks upon his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus she answers him with queenly grace:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"So soon must go? Thou canst not cross the sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thou wilt perish in the waves that way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Great Samas once the way of me did ask,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I forbade him, but the mighty task</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He undertook, and crossed the mighty deep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where Death's dark waters lie in wait asleep:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His mighty car of gold swept through the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With fiery chargers now he daily flies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I approach thee, thou from me wouldst flee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But if thou must so soon thus go, the sea</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps thou too canst cross, if thou wilt 'void</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Death's waters, which relentless ever glide.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Izdubar, Ur-Hea, here hath come!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The boatman of the seer, who to his home</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Returns. He with an axe in yonder woods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A vessel builds to cross the raging floods.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If thou desirest not to cross with him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We here will welcome thee through endless time;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But if thou goest, may they see thy face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou seekest,—welcome thee, and thy heart bless."</p>

<p>COLUMN II</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE KING ON LEAVING THE HAPPY HALLS MEETS UR-HEA, THE BOATMAN OF THE SEER
KHASISADRA—THEY BUILD A SHIP AND EMBARK ON AN UNKNOWN SEA, AND ON THEIR
VOYAGE PASS THROUGH THE WATERS OF DEATH</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And Izdubar turned from the Halls and goes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Toward a fountain in the park, whence flows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A merry stream toward the wood. He finds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An axe beside the fount, and thoughtful winds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through groves of sandal-wood and mastic-trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And algum, umritgana. Now he sees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sig-a-ri and ummakana, pines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With babuaku; and ri-wood brightly shines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Among the azuhu; all precious woods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That man esteems are grown around, each buds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Continuous in the softened, balmy air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He stops beneath a musrilkanna where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The pine-trees spread toward the glowing sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wild mingled with the surman, sa-u-ri.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King, now seated, with himself communes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heeds not the warbling of the birds, and tunes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of gorgeous songsters in the trees around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But sadly sighing gazes on the ground:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"And I a ship must build; alas! I know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not how I shall return, if I thus go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The awful Flood of Death awaits me there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wide-stretching from this shore—I know not where."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He rests his chin upon his hand in thought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Full weary of a life that woe had brought;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He says: "When I remember Siduri,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose heart with fondest love would comfort me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within these Happy Halls, why should I go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To pain and anguish, death, mayhap, and woe?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But will I thus desert my kingdom, throne?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For one I know not! What! my fame alone!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mine honor should preserve! and royal state!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! this Fame is but a dream of—Fate!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"A longing after that which does not cheer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The heart. Applause of men, or thoughtless sneer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is naught to me, I am alone! alone!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This Immortality cannot atone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For my hard fate that wrings mine aching heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I long for peace and rest, and I must start</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And find it, leave these luring bright abodes,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I seek the immortality of gods.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This Fame of man is not what it doth seem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It sleeps with all the past, a vanished dream.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My duty calls me to my kingdom, throne!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Khasisadra go, whose aid alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can save my people from an awful fate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That hangs above them, born of Fiends of hate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I shall there return without my seer!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I live; and he is dead. Why did I hear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His words advising me to come? Alas!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I sadly all my weary days shall pass;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No one shall love me as my seer, my friend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But what said Siduri?—There comes an end</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At last to sorrow, joy will hopeful spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On wings of Light! Oh, how my heart will sing!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I bless ye all, ye holy spirits here!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your songs will linger with me, my heart cheer;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon my way I turn with joy again!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How true your joyful song! your memory then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will keep me hopeful through yon darkened way;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How bright this land doth look beside the sea!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He looks across the fields; the river glows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And winds beside taprani-trees, and flows</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By teberinth and groves of tarpikhi</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ku-trees; curving round green mez-kha-i,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through beds of flowers, that kiss its waves and spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Luxuriant,—with songs the groves far ring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now thinking of the ship, he turns his eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Toward the fountain,—springs up with surprise!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"'Tis he! the boatman comes! Ur-Hea comes!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, oh! at last, I'll reach the glistening domes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Khasisadra's palaces,—at last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My feet shall rest,—upon that land be placed."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now Ur-Hea nearer makes his way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Izdubar addressing him, doth say:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Ur-Hea is thy name? from yonder sea</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou comest, from the seer across the way?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Thou speakest truth, great Sar, what wouldst thou have?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"How shall I Khasisadra reach? The grave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He hath escaped, Immortal lives beyond,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I to him upon my way am bound;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall I the waters cross or take my way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through yon wide desert, for I start this day?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Across the sea we go, for I with thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Return to him,—I know the winding way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thine axe of bronze with precious stones inlaid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With mine, we'll use beneath the pine-trees' shade."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now, within the grove a ship they made,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Complete and strong as wise Ur-Hea bade.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They fell the pines five <emphasis>gar</emphasis> in length, and hew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The timbers square, and soon construct a new</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And buoyant vessel, firmly fixed the mast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tackling, sails, and oars make taut and fast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus built, toward the sea they push its prow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Equipped complete, provisioned, launch it now.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An altar next they raise and thus invoke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods, their evil-workings to revoke:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"[1]O Lord of Charms, Illustrious! who gives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Life to the Dead, the Merciful who lives,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And grants to hostile gods of Heaven return,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To homage render, worship thee, and learn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Obedience! Thou who didst create mankind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In tenderness, thy love round us, oh, wind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Merciful, the God with whom is Life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Establish us, O Lord, in darkest strife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O never may thy truth forgotten be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May Accad's race forever worship thee."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>One month and fifteen days upon the sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus far the voyagers are on their way;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now black before them lies a barren shore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'ertopped with frowning cliffs, whence comes a roar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of some dread fury of the elements</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That shakes the air and sweeping wrath foments</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er winds and seas.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And see! a yawning cave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There opens vast into a void dislave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where fremèd shadows ride the hueless waves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dread Ninazu whose deathless fury craves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For hapless victims lashes with a roar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mighty seas upon that awful shore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Fiends of Darkness gathered lie in wait,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Mammitu, the goddess of fierce hate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Gibil[2] with his spells, and Nibiru[3]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The twin-god of black Fate, and grim Nusku[4]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The keeper of red thunders, and Urbat[5]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The dog of Death, and fiend of Queen Belat;[6]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Nuk-khu, and the black-browed Ed-hutu[7]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The gods of darkness here with Tsi-lat-tu.[8]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And see! Dark Rimmon[9] o'er a crag alone!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Gibil with his blasting malisoun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above with his dark face maleficent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who wields a power o'er men omnipotent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forlore! forlore! the souls who feel that blast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which sweeps around that black forbidding coast!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fierce whirling storms and hurricanes here leap,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With blasting lightnings maltalent and sweep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The furious waves that lash around that shore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the fierce whirl of some dread maëlstrom's power!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above the cavern's arch! see! Ninip[10] stands!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He points within the cave with beckoning hands!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ur-Hea cries: "My lord! the tablets[11] say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That we should not attempt that furious way!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those waters of black death will smite us down!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within that cavern's depths we will but drown."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"We cannot go but once, my friend, that road,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hero said, "'Tis only ghosts' abode!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"We go, then, Izdubar, its depths will sound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But we within that gloom will whirl around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Around, within that awful whirlpool black,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And once within, we dare not then turn back,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How many times, my friend, I dare not say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis written, we within shall make our way."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The foaming tide now grasped them with its power,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And billowed round them with continuous roar;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away! they whirl! with growing speed, till now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They fly on lightnings' wings and ride the brow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of maddened tempests o'er the dizzy deep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So swift they move,—the waves in seeming sleep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath them, whirling there with force unseen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But see! Updarting with a sulphurous gleen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hag of Death leaps on the trembling prow!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her eyes, of fire and hate, turns on them now!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With famine gaunt, and haggard face of doom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She sits there soundless in the awful gloom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"O gods!" shrieked Izdubar in his despair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Have I the god of Fate at last met here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Avaunt, thou Fiend! hence to thy pit of Hell!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hence! hence! and rid me of thy presence fell!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And see! she nearer comes with deathless ire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With those fierce, moveless, glaring eyes of fire!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her wand is raised! she strikes!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  "O gods!" he screams;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He falls beneath that bolt that on them gleams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she is gone within the awful gloom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hark! hear those screams!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  "Accurst! Accurst thy doom!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lo! he springs upon his feet in pain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cries:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  "Thy curses, fiend! I hurl again!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now a blinding flash disparts the black</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And heavy air, a moment light doth break;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! the King leans fainting 'gainst the mast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With glaring eyeballs, clenched hands,—aghast!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold! that pallid face and scaly hands!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A leper white, accurst of gods, he stands!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A living death, a life of awful woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Incurable by man, his way shall go.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But oh! the seer in all enchantments wise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will cure him on that shore, or else he dies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And see! the vessel's prow with shivering turns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Adown the roaring flood that gapes and churns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath like some huge boiling cauldron black,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus whirl they in the slimy cavern's track.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And spirit ravens round them fill the air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! they fly! the cavern sweeps behind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Away the ship doth ride before the wind!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The darkness deep from them has fled away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fiends are gone!—the vessel in the spray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With spreading sails has caught the glorious breeze,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And dances in the light o'er shining seas;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The blissful haven shines upon their way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The waters of the Dawn sweep o'er the sea!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They proudly ride up to the glowing sand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And joyfully the King springs to the land.</p>

prayers which are numbered and addressed to separate deities. It seems
that the prayers were originally Accadian, and were afterward adopted by
the Assyrians, and made to apply to one god (Hea). Professor Oppert and
Professor Sayce think, however, that they are connected in one hymn to
Hea. This may have been so after the Assyrians adopted them, but they are
distinct, and addressed to separate gods. The one we have selected is

<p><strong>KHASISADRA ON THE SHORE SEES THE VESSEL COMING, AND RETURNING TO HIS
PALACE, SENDS HIS DAUGHTER MUA TO WELCOME IZDUBAR—MEETING OF THE KING AND
SAGE</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Beneath a ku-tree Khasisadra eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The spreading sea beneath the azure skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An agèd youth with features grave, serene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Matured with godly wisdom; ne'er was seen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such majesty, nor young, nor old,—a seer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In purpose high. The countenance no fear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of death has marred, but on his face sublime</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The perfect soul has left its seal through time.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ah, yes! the dream was clear, the vision true,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw him on the ship! Is it in view?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A speck! Ah, yes! He comes! he comes to me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My son from Erech comes across the sea!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Back to his palace goes the holy seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Mua[1] sends, who now the shore doth near;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As beautiful as Waters of the Dawn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Comes Mua here, as graceful as a fawn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The King now standing on the glistening sand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beholds the beauteous Mua where she stands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With hands outstretched in welcome to the King,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"O thou sweet spirit, with thy snowy wing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, where is Khasisadra in this land?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I seek the aid of his immortal hand."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Great Sar," said Mua, "hadst thou not a seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That thou shouldst come to seek my father here?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'Tis true, my daughter dear, a seer had I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom I have lost,—a dire calamity;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By his advice and love I undertake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This journey. But alas! for mine own sake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He fell by perils on this lengthened way;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was not strong, and feared that he should lay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Himself to rest amid the mountains wild.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was a warrior, with him I killed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Khumbaba, Elam's king who safely dwelt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within a forest vast of pines, and dealt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Destruction o'er the plains. We razed his walls—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My friend at last before me dying falls.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Alas! why did my seer attempt to slay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The dragons that we met upon the way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He slew his foe, and like a lion died.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ah, me! the cause, when I the gods defied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And brought upon us all this awful woe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In sorrow o'er his death, my life must flow!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this I came to find the ancient seer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lead me to him, I pray, if he lives here."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then Mua leads him through the glorious land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of matchless splendor, on the border grand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of those wide Happy Fields that spread afar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O'er beaming hills and vales, where ambient air</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With sweetest zephyrs sweeps a grand estrade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where softest odors from each flowering glade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lull every sense aswoon that breathes not bliss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And harmony with World of Blessedness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Neath trees of luring fruits she leads the way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through paths of flowers where night hath fled away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wilderness of varied crystal flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where fragrance rests o'er clustering, shining bowers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Each gleaming cup its nectared wine distils,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For spirit lips each chalice ever fills.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Beyond the groves a lucent palace shone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In grandest splendor near an inner zone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In amethyst and gold divinely rose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With glories scintillant the palace glows.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A dazzling halo crowns its lofty domes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And spreading from its summit softly comes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With grateful rays, and floods the balustrades</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And golden statues 'neath the high arcades;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A holy palace built by magic hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With wondrous architecture, portals grand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And aurine turrets piled to dizzy heights,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, how its glory Izdubar delights!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Beneath majestic arcades carved, they pass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Up golden steps that shine like polished glass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through noble corridors with sculptured walls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By lofty columns, archways to the halls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of glories, the bright harbinger of fanes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of greater splendor of the Heavenly plains.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beneath an arch of gems the King espies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A form immortal, he who death defies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Advancing forth the sage his welcome gives,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"'Tis Izdubar who comes to me and lives!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Embracing him he leads him in a room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where many a curious graven tablet, tome,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And scrolls of quaint and old forgotten lore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have slept within for centuries of yore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tablets high are heaped, the alcoves full,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where truth at last has found a welcome goal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In wisdom's room, the sage his guest has led,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And seats him till the banquet high is spread;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Izdubar he learns his journeys great,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How he for aid has left his throne of state.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The maid now comes, him welcomes to the hall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of banquets, where are viands liberal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fruits, immortal bread, celestial wines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of vintage old; and when the hero dines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They lead him to his private chamber room</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That overlooks the wondrous garden's bloom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Across the plain and jasper sea divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Heaven's mountains rising sapphirine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Four beauteous streams of liquid silver lead</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Across the plain; the shining sea they feed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The King reclines upon his couch at rest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With dreams of happiness alone is blest.</p>

IMMORTAL</strong></p>

<p>When Izdubar awakes, they lead the way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To the bright fount beside the jasper sea.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The seer, with Mua and Ur-Hea, stands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the King, who holily lifts his hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Above an altar where the glowing rays</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of sacred flames are curling; thus he prays:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Ye glorious stars that shine on high,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Remember me! Oh, hear my cry,</p>

<p>As Izdubar doth end his holy prayer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He kneels, and they now bear his body where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A snowy couch doth rest beneath a shrine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That stands near by the glowing fount divine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Khasisadra lifts his holy hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His incantation chants, and o'er him stands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"O Bel, Lord of An-nu-na-ci,</p>

A glow of youth immortal on his cheek,</p>

A form that sorrow, death, will never seek</p>

Within these Happy Fields, his eyes with light</p>

<p>

Its rays o'er couches of paruti[4] stone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Soft cushioned, circling in the inner zone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside the shining kami-sadi way,[5]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where nectar fountains in their splendor play.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The path leads far along Life's beauteous stream,</p>
<empty-line/>

That ever through this World of Joy doth gleam.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And see! the hero comes! and now doth near</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The maiden, where with Love she waits him here.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She flings a flowering garland, weaves it round</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His form as he comes by! He turns around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she enwraps his breast and arms, and says:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Dear Izdubar! and thus my lover strays!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll bind thee with this fragrant chain to keep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee ever by my side! thy pleasant sleep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath kept my lover from my side too long!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"O thou sweet spirit, like a warbling song</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy words are to my heart! I sought for thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thy bright face and presence did not see;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I come to tell thee that I must return,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When from thy father all the past shall learn."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And wilt thou go from me to earth again?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No! no! dear Izdubar, I thee enchain!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"'Tis true, my love, I must return to men;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My duty calls me to my throne again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Dear Izdubar! my friend! my love! my heart!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot let thee from my soul depart!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou shinest in my breast as some bright star!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shall I let thee from me go afar?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"But Mua, we immortal are, and we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There might return; and thou on earth shalt see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The glories of my kingdom,—be my queen!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon a couch I'll seat thee, there to reign</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With me, my beauteous queen,—beside me sit;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And kings will come to us and kiss thy feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all my wealth I'll clothe thee, ever love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee, fairest of these glorious souls that move</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within this Happy World. My people there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall love us,—ever drive away all care!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Mua heard him offer thus his hand,</p>
<empty-line/>

She then unbinds him,—thoughtful now doth stand.</p>

<p><strong>MUA'S ANSWER</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sweet Mua lifts her eyes toward the heights</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That glow afar beneath the softened lights</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That rest upon the mountain's crystalline.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And see! they change their hues incarnadine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To gold, and emerald, and opaline;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Swift changing to a softened festucine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before the eye. And thus they change their hues</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To please the sight of every soul that views</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Them in that Land; but she heeds not the skies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or glorious splendor of her home; her eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have that far look of spirits viewing men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On earth, from the invisible mane,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That erstwhile rests upon the mortal eye,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A longing for that home beyond the sky;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A yearning for that bliss that love imparts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where pain and sorrow reach no mortal hearts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A light now breaks across her beauteous face;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She, turning, says to him with Heavenly grace:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Dear Izdubar, thou knowest how I love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee, how my heart my love doth daily prove;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, oh, I cannot let thee go alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I know not what awaits each soul there gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our spirits often leave this glorious land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Invisible return on earth, and stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Amidst its flowerets, 'neath its glorious skies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou knowest every spirit here oft flies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From earth, but none its secrets to us tell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lest some dark sorrow might here work its spell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, oh, I could not see dark suffering, woe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There spread, with power none to stop its flow!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I saw thee coming to us struck with fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, how to aid thee did my heart desire!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our tablets tell us how dread sorrow spreads</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon that world and mars its glowing meads.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, oh, so happy am I, here to know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That they with us here end all sorrow, woe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O precious Izdubar! its sights would strike</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Me there with sadness, and my heart would break!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet I learn that it is glorious, sweet!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To there enjoy its happiness,—so fleet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It speeds to sorrowing hearts to turn their tears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To joy! How sweet to them when it appears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sends a gleam of Heaven through their lives!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"No! no! dear heart! I cannot go! It grieves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee! come, my dear one! quick to us return;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We here again will pair our love, and learn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How sweet it is to meet with joy again;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How happy will sweet love come to us then!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>She rests her head upon his breast, and lifts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her face for Love's sweet kiss, and from them drifts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A halo o'er the shining gesdin-trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And spreads around them Heaven's holy rays.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He kisses her sweet lips, and brow, and eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then turns his gaze toward the glowing skies:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I bless thee, for thy sweetest spirit here!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I bless this glorious land, that brings me near</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To one that wafts sweet Heaven in my heart;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From thy dear plains how can my soul depart?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Mua, Mua! how my heart now sings!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy love is sweeter than all earthly things!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would I were not crowned a king!—away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From this bright land—here would I ever stay!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As thou hast said, I soon will here return;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The earth cannot withhold me from this bourne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And soon my time allotted there will end,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hitherward how happy I will wend!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"And when thou goest, how my love shall there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Guard thee, and keep thy heart with Mua here.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Another kiss!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her form doth disappear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the garden, gliding through the air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He seats himself upon a couch and rests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His head upon his hand, and thought invests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Him round. His memory returns again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To Erech's throne, and all the haunts of men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He rises, turns his footsteps to the halls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thoughtful disappears within its walls.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The charms translated below will illustrate the superstition of the
Assyrians and Babylonians. Like the Jews of the Talmud, they believed that
the world was swarming with noxious spirits who produced the various
diseases to which man is liable, and might be swallowed with the food and
the drink that support life. They counted no less than 300 spirits of
heaven and 600 spirits of earth. All this, with the rest of their
mythology, was borrowed by the Assyrians from the primitive population of
Babylonia, who spoke an agglutinative language akin to the dialects of the
Finnic or Tatar tribes. The charms are written in this ancient language,
but Assyrian translations are appended in a column to the right of the
tablet. The legends are lithographed in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of
Western Asia," Vol. II, plates 17 and 18. They have been translated by M.
Oppert in the "<emphasis>Journal Asiatique</emphasis>" of January, 1873, and an analytical
rendering of them is given by M. Fr. Lenormant in his "<emphasis>Etudes

<p><strong>ACCADIAN HYMN TO ISTAR</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The following is one of the many early Chaldean hymns that were
incorporated into a collection which M. Lenormant has aptly compared with
the Rig-Veda of India. The concluding lines show that it originally
belonged to the city of Erech (now Warka). The date of its composition
must be exceedingly remote, and this increases the interest of the
astronomical allusions contained in it. The original Accadian text is
given, with an interlinear Assyrian translation, as is usually the case
with hymns of this kind. The terra-cotta tablet on which it is found is
numbered S, 954, being one of those that have been recently brought back
from Assyria by Mr. George Smith, who has translated the Reverse in his
"Assyrian Discoveries," pp. 392, 393. I owe a copy of the text to the
kindness of Mr. Boscawen. It is of considerable importance for the study
of Assyrian grammar.</p>

<p>ANNALS OF ASSUR-NASIR-PAL (SOMETIMES CALLED SARDANAPALUS)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED, WITH NOTES, BY REV. J.M. RODWELL, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Concerning Assur-nasir-habal or Assur-nasir-pal (<emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>, "Assur preserves
the son") we possess fuller historical records than of any other of the
Assyrian monarchs, and among these the following inscription is the most
important. From it, and from the inscription upon his statue discovered by
Mr. Layard [Footnote: Now in the British Museum.] in the ruins of one of
the Nimroud temples, we learn that he was the son of Tuklat-Adar or
Tuklat-Ninip, that he reigned over a territory extending from the "Tigris
to the Lebanon, and that he brought the great sea and all countries from
the sunrise to the sunset under his sway." These inscriptions are
published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia," Vol. I, plates
17 to 27, and were partially translated by Professor Oppert, "<emphasis>Histoire
des Empires de Chaldée et d'Assyrie,</emphasis>," page 73 and following "<emphasis>Extrait
des Annales de philosophie chrétienne</emphasis>" tom. IX, 1865.</p>
<p>There is considerable difficulty and a consequent divergence of opinion as
to the precise date when Assur-nasir-pal ascended the throne. But he most
probably reigned from 883 to 858 B.C.</p>
<p>It need scarcely be remarked that Assur-nasir-pal is a different person
from the well-known Sardanapalus of classic writers, or Assur-bani-pal,
the son of Esar-haddon, who reigned from about B.C. 668 to 625.</p>
<p>It will be seen from the inscription that the campaigns of Assur-nasir-pal
took place in the mountains of Armenia, in Commagene and the provinces of
the Pontus, inhabited by the Moschi [Footnote: The Mesek of Psalm cxx. 5.]
and other tribes. He probably advanced into Media and a portion of western
Persia. The countries on the banks of the Euphrates submitted to his arms,
and in one of his expeditions he vanquished Nabu-bal-iddin, King of
Babylon. Westward, he reduced the southern part of Syria, and advanced to
the mountain chains of the Amanus and Lebanon, but though he penetrated as
far as to Tyre and Sidon and exacted tribute from both as well as from
Byblus and Aradus, he did not subdue Phoenicia. The kingdoms of Israel and
Judah, under the sway of Ahab and Jehosaphat, were no doubt too powerful,
as is evinced by the armies which they must have maintained for their
struggle with the Syrians, [Footnote: See 2 Chron. xvii. and following
chapters.] for Assur-nasir-pal to have ventured upon attacking them. This
feat was reserved for his successors on the throne of Assyria.</p>

     of the seven,[3]
     noble ruler, King of the gods the producers, governor, he who
     rolls along the mass
3    of heaven and earth, opener of canals, treader of the wide earth,
     the god who in
     his divinity nourishes heaven and earth, the beneficent,
4    the exalted, the powerful, who has not lessened the glory of his
     face,[4] head of
     nations, bestower of sceptres, glorious, over all cities a
     ruler,[5]
5    valiant, the renown of whose sceptre is not approached, chief of
     widespread influence, great among the gods, shading from the
     southern sun, Lord of Lords, whose hand the vault of heaven
6    (and) earth has controlled, a King in battle mighty[6] who has
     vanquished opposition, victorious, powerful, Lord of
     water-courses and seas,[7]
7    strong, not yielding, whose onset brings down the green corn,

     deity who changes not his purposes,
8    the light of heaven and earth, a bold leader on the waters,
     destroyer of them that hate (him), a spoiler (and) Lord
     of the disobedient, dividing enemies, whose name in the
     speech of the gods
9    no god has ever disregarded, the gatherer of life, the god(?)
     whose prayers are good, whose abode is in the city of Calah,
     a great Lord, my Lord—(who am) Assur-nasir-pal, the
     mighty King,
10   King of multitudes, a Prince unequalled, Lord of all the
     four countries, powerful over hosts of men, the possession
     of Bel and Ninip the exalted and Anu
11   and of Dakan,[8] a servant of the great gods in the lofty shrine
     for great (O Ninip) is thy heart; a worshipper of Bel whose
     might upon
12   thy great deity is founded, and thou makest righteous his
     life, valiant, warrior, who in the service of Assur his Lord
     hath proceeded, and among the Kings
13   of the four regions who has not his fellow, a Prince for
     admiration, not sparing opponents, mighty leader, who an
     equal
14   has not, a Prince reducing to order his disobedient ones,
     who has subdued whole multitudes of men, a strong worker,
     treading down
15   the heads of his enemies, trampling on all foes, crushing
     assemblages of rebels, who in the service of the great gods
     his Lords
16   marched vigorously and the lands of all of them his hand
     captured, caused the forests of all of them to fall,[9] and
     received their tribute, taking
17   securities, establishing laws over all lands, when Assur the
     Lord who proclaims my name and augments my Royalty
18   laid hold upon his invincible power for the forces of my
     Lordship, for Assur-nasir-pal, glorious Prince, worshipper
     of the great gods
19   the generous, the great, the powerful, acquirer of cities and
     forests and the territory of all of them, King of Lords,
     destroying the wicked, strengthening
20   the peaceful, not sparing opponents, a Prince of firm will(?)
     one who combats oppression, Lord of all Kings,
21   Lord of Lords, the acknowledged, King of Kings, seated
     gloriously, the renown of Ninip the warrior, worshipper of
     the great gods, prolonging the benefits (conferred by) his
     fathers:
22   a Prince who in the service of Assur and the Sun-god, the
     gods in whom he trusted, royally marched to turbulent lands,
     and Kings who had rebelled against him
23   he cut off like grass, all their lands to his feet he subjected,
     restorer of the worship of the goddesses and that of the
     great gods,
24   Chief unwavering, who for the guidance of the heads (and)
     elders of his land is a steadfast guardian, the work of whose
     hands and
25   the gift of whose finger the great gods of heaven and earth
     have exalted, and his steps[10] over rulers have they established
     forever;
26   their power for the preservation of my Royalty have they
     exercised; the retribution of his power, (and) the approach
     of His Majesty over Princes
27   of the four regions they have extended: the enemies of Assur
     in all their country, the upper and the lower I chastised, and
     tribute and impost
28   upon them I established, capturing the enemies of Assur—mighty
     King, King of Assyria, son of Tuklat-Adar who all
     his enemies
29   has scattered; (who) in the dust threw down the corpses of
     his enemies, the grandson of Bin-nirari, the servant of the
     great gods,
30   who crucified alive and routed his enemies and subdued
     them to his yoke, descendant of Assur-dan-il, who the
     fortresses
31   established (and) the fanes made good. In those days by
     the decree[11] of the great gods to royalty power supremacy
     I rose up:
32   I am a King, I am a Lord, I am glorious, I am great, I am
     mighty, I have arisen, I am Chief, I am a Prince, I am a
     warrior
33   I am great and I am glorious, Assur-nasir-habal, a mighty
     King of Assyria, proclaimer of the Moon-god, worshipper
     of Anu, exalter of Yav,[12] suppliant of the gods
34   am I, servant unyielding, subduing the land of his foeman,
     a King mighty in battle, destroyer of cities and forests,
35   Chief over opponents, King of the four regions, expeller of
     his foes, prostrating all his enemies, Prince of a multitude
     of lands of all Kings
36   Even of all, a Prince subduing those disobedient to him,
     who is ruling all the multitudes of men. These aspirations
     to the face of the great gods
37   have gone up; on my destiny steadfastly have they determined;
     at the wishes of my heart and the uplifting of my
     hand, Istar, exalted Lady,
38   hath favored me in my intentions, and to the conduct of
     (my) battles and warfare hath applied her heart. In those
     days I Assur-nasir-pal, glorious Prince, worshipper of the
     great gods
39   the wishes of whose heart Bel will cause him to attain, and
     who has conquered all Kings who disobey him, and by his
     hand capturing
40   his enemies, who in difficult places has beaten down assemblages
     of rebels; when Assur, mighty Lord, proclaimer of my name
41   aggrandizer of my royalty over the Kings of the four
     regions, bountifully hath added his invincible power to the
     forces of my government,
42   putting me in possession of lands, and mighty forests for
     exploration hath he given and urgently impelled me—by the
     might of Assur my Lord,
43   perplexed paths, difficult mountains by the impetuosity of
     my hosts I traversed, and an equal there was not. In the
     beginning of my reign
44   (and) in my first campaign when the Sun-god guider of
     the lands threw over me his beneficent protection[13] on the
     throne of my dominion I firmly seated myself; a sceptre
45   the dread of man into my hands I took; my chariots (and)
     armies I collected; rugged paths, difficult mountains, which
     for the passage
46   of chariots and armies was not suited I passed, and to the
     land of Nairi[14] I went: Libie, their capital city, the cities
     Zurra and Abuqu
47   Arura Arubie, situated within the limits of the land of
     Aruni and Etini, fortified cities, I took, their fighting-men
48   in numbers I slew; their spoil, their wealth, their cattle I
     spoiled; their soldiers were discouraged; they took possession
     of a difficult mountain, a mountain exceedingly difficult;
     after them
49   I did not proceed, for it was a mountain ascending up like
     lofty points of iron, and the beautiful birds of heaven had
     not reached up into it: like nests
50   of the young birds in the midst of the mountain their defence
     they placed, into which none of the Kings my fathers had
     ever penetrated: in three days
51   successfully on one large mountain, his courage vanquished
     opposition: along the feet of that mountain I crept and hid:
     their nests, their tents,
52   I broke up; 200 of their warriors with weapons I destroyed;
     their spoil in abundance like the young of sheep I carried off;
53   their corpses like rubbish on the mountains I heaped up;
     their relics in tangled hollows of the mountains I consumed;
     their cities
54   I overthrew, I demolished, in fire I burned: from the land
     of Nummi to the land of Kirruri I came down; the tribute
     of Kirruri
55   of the territory of Zimizi, Zimira, Ulmanya, Adavas, Kargai,
     Harmasai, horses,[15] (fish (?),
56   oxen, horned sheep in numbers, copper, as their tribute I
     received: an officer to guard boundaries[16] over them I placed.
     While in the land of Kirruri
57   they detained me, the fear of Assur my Lord overwhelmed
     the lands of Gilzanai and Khubuskai; horses, silver
58   gold, tin, copper, <emphasis>kams</emphasis> of copper as their tribute they brought
     to me. From the land of Kirruri I withdrew;
59   to a territory close by the town Khulun in Gilhi[17] Bitani
     I passed: the cities of Khatu, Khalaru, Nistun, Irbidi,
60   Mitkie, Arzanie, Zila, Khalue, cities of Gilhi situated in the
     environs of Uzie and Arue
61   and Arardi powerful lands, I occupied: their soldiers in
     numbers I slew; their spoil, their riches I carried off;
62   their soldiers were discouraged; the summits projecting over
     against the city of Nistun which were menacing like the
     storms of heaven, I captured;
63   into which no one among the Princes my sires had ever penetrated;
     my soldiers like birds (of prey) rushed upon them;
64   260 of their warriors by the sword I smote down; their
     heads cut off in heaps I arranged; the rest of them like birds
65   in a nest, in the rocks of the mountains nestled; their spoil,
     their riches from the midst of the mountains I brought
     down; cities which were in the midst
66   of vast forests situated I overthrew, destroyed, burned in
     fire; the rebellious soldiers fled from before my arms; they
     came down; my yoke
67   they received; impost tribute and a Viceroy I set over them.
     Bubu son of Bubua son of the Prefect of Nistun
68   in the city of Arbela I flayed; his skin I stretched in contempt
     upon the wall. At that time an image of my person
     I made; a history of my supremacy
69   upon it I wrote, and (on) a mountain of the land of Ikin(?)
     in the city of Assur-nasir-pal at the foot I erected (it). In
     my own eponym in the month of July[18] and the 24th day
     (probably B.C. 882).
70   in honor of Assur and Istar the great gods my Lords, I
     quitted the city of Nineveh: to cities situated below Nipur
     and Pazate powerful countries
71   I proceeded; Atkun, Nithu, Pilazi and 20 other cities in
     their environs I captured; many of their soldiers I slew;
72   their spoil, their riches I carried off; the cities I burned with
     fire; the rebel soldiers fled from before my arms, submitted,
73   and took my yoke; I left them in possession of their land.
     From the cities below Nipur and Pazate I withdrew; the
     Tigris I passed;
74   to the land of Commagene I approached; the tribute of Commagene
     and of the Moschi[19] in <emphasis>kams</emphasis> of copper, sheep and
     goats I received; while in Commagene
75   I was stationed, they brought me intelligence that the city
     Suri in Bit-Khalupe had revolted. The people of Hamath
     had slain their governor
76   Ahiyababa the son of Lamamana[20] they brought from Bit-Adini
     and made him their King. By help of Assur and
     Yav
77   the great gods who aggrandize my royalty, chariots, (and)
     an army, I collected: the banks of the Chaboras[21] I occupied;
     in my passage tribute
78   in abundance from Salman-haman-ilin of the city of Sadi-kannai
     and of Il-yav of the city of Sunai,[22] silver, gold,
79   tin, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of copper, vestments of wool, vestments of linen
     I received. To Suri which is in Bit-Halupe I drew near;
80   the fear of the approach of Assur my Lord overwhelmed
     them; the great men and the multitudes of the city, for the
     saving of their lives, coming up after me,[23]
81   submitted to my yoke; some slain, some living, some tongueless
     I made: Ahiyababa son of Lamamana
82   whom from Bit-Adini they had fetched, I captured; in the
     valor of my heart and the steadfastness of my soldiers I besieged
     the city; the soldiers, rebels all,
83   were taken prisoners; the nobles to the principal palace of
     his land I caused to send; his silver, his gold, his treasure,
     his riches, copper
84   (?)tin, <emphasis>kams, tabhani, hariati</emphasis> of copper, choice copper in
     abundance, alabaster and iron-stone of large size
85   the treasures of his harem, his daughters and the wives of
     the rebels with their treasures, and the gods with their
     treasures,
86   precious stones of the land of …, his swift chariot,
     his horses, the harness, his chariot-yoke, trappings for
     horses, coverings for men,
87   vestments of wool, vestments of linen, handsome altars of
     cedar, handsome …, bowls of cedar-wood
88   beautiful black coverings, beautiful purple coverings, carpets,
     his oxen, his sheep, his abundant spoil, which like the
     stars of heaven could not be reckoned,
89   I carried off; Aziel as my lieutenant over them I placed; a
     trophy along the length of the great gate I erected: the
     rebellious nobles
90   who had revolted against me and whose skins I had stripped
     off, I made into a trophy: some in the middle of the pile
     I left to decay; some on the top
91   of the pile on stakes I impaled; some by the side of the pile
     I placed in order on stakes; many within view of my land
92   I flayed; their skins on the walls I arranged; of the officers
     of the King's officer, rebels, the limbs I cut off;
93   I brought Ahiyababa to Nineveh; I flayed[24] him and fastened
     his skin to the wall; laws and edicts
94   over Lakie I established. While I was staying in Suri the
     tribute of the Princes of Lakie throughout the whole of
     them,
95   silver, gold, tin, copper, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of copper, oxen, sheep,
     vestments
     of wool and linen, as tribute
96   and gift, I defined and imposed upon them. In those days,
     the tribute of Khayani of the city of Hindanai, silver,
97   gold, tin, copper, amu-stone, alabaster blocks, beautiful
     black (and) lustrous coverings I received as tribute from
     him. In those days an enlarged image
98   of my Royalty I made; edicts and decrees upon it I wrote;
     in the midst of his palace I put it up; of stone my tablets
     I made;
99   the decrees of my throne upon it I wrote; in the great gate
     I fixed them, in the date of this year which takes its name
     from me, in honor of Assur my Lord and Ninip who uplifts
     my feet.[25]
100  Whereas in the times of the Kings my fathers no man
     of Suhi to Assyria had ever come, Il-bani Prince of Suhi
     together with his soldiers
101  (and) his son, silver, gold as his tribute to Nineveh in
     abundance brought: in my own eponym[26] at the city of Nineveh
     I stayed: news
102  they brought me that men of the land of Assyria, (and)
     Hulai the governor of their city which Shalmaneser King
     of Assyria my predecessor
103  to the city of Hasiluha had united, had revolted: Dandamusa[27]
     a city of my dominion marched out to subdue
     (them);
104  in honor of Assur, the Sun-god and Yav, the gods in whom
     I trust, my chariots and army I collected at the head of the
     river Zupnat, the place of an image
105  which Tiglath-Pileser and Tiglath-Adar, Kings of Assyria
     my fathers had raised; an image of My Majesty I constructed
     and put up with theirs.
106  In those days I renewed the tribute of the land of Izala,
     oxen, sheep, goats: to the land of Kasyari[28] I proceeded,
     and to Kinabu
107  the fortified city of the province of Hulai. I drew near;
     with the impetuosity of my formidable attack I besieged and
     took the town; 600 of their fighting men
108  with (my) arms I destroyed; 3,000 of their captives I consigned
     to the flames; as hostages I left not one of them alive;
     Hulai
109  the governor of their town I captured by (my) hand alive;
     their corpses into piles I built; their boys and maidens I
     dishonored;
110  Hulai the governor of their city I flayed: his skin on the
     walls of Damdamusa I placed in contempt; the city I overthrew
     demolished, burned with fire;
     in the city of Mariru within their territory I took; 50 warrior
     fighting men by (my) weapons I destroyed; 200 of their captives
     in the flame I burned;
112  the soldiers of the land of Nirbi I slew in fight in the
     desert; their spoil, their oxen, their sheep, I brought away;
     Nirbu which is at the foot of mount Ukhira
113  I boldly took; I then passed over to Tila their fortified city;
     from Kinabu I withdrew; to Tila I drew near;
114  a strong city with three forts facing each other: the soldiers
     to their strong forts and numerous army trusted and
     would not submit;
115  my yoke they would not accept; (then,) with onset and
     attack I besieged the city; their fighting men with my
     weapons I destroyed; of their spoil,
116  their riches, oxen and sheep, I made plunder; much booty
     I burned with fire; many soldiers I captured alive;
117  of some I chopped off the hands and feet; of others the
     noses and ears I cut off; of many soldiers I destroyed the
     eyes;[29]
118  one pile of bodies while yet alive, and one of heads I reared
     up on the heights within their town; their heads in the midst
     I hoisted; their boys</p>

<p>1    and their maidens I dishonored, the city I overthrew, razed
     and burned with fire,
     In those days the cities of the land of Nirbi
2    (and) their strong fortresses, I overthrew, demolished,
     burned with fire: from Nirbi I withdrew and to the city
     Tuskha
3    I approached; the city of Tuskha I again occupied; its
     old fort I threw down: its place I prepared, its dimensions
     I took; a new castle
4    from its foundation to its roof I built, I completed, I reared:
     a palace for the residence of My Royalty with doors of <emphasis>iki</emphasis>
     wood I made;
5    a palace of brick from its foundations to its roof I made, I
     completed: a complete image of my person of polished
     stone I made; the history
6    of my surpassing nation and an account of my conquests
     which in the country of Nairi I had accomplished I wrote
     upon it; in the city of Tuskha
7    I raised it; on suitable stone I wrote and upon the wall I
     fixed it; (then) the men of Assyria, those who from the privation
     of food to various countries
8    And to Rurie had gone up, to Tuskha I brought back and
     settled there: that city to myself
9    I took; the wheats and barleys of Nirbi I accumulated in
     it; the populace of Nirbi who before my arms had fled,
10   returned and accepted my yoke; of their towns, their Viceroys,
     their many convenient houses I took possession; impost
     and tribute, horses,
11   horses for the yoke, fish, oxen, sheep, goats in addition to
     what I had before settled, I imposed upon them; their
     youths as hostages
12   I took. While I was staying in Tuskha, I received the
     tribute of Ammibaal son of Zamani, of Anhiti of the land
     of Rurie
13   of Labduri son of Dubuzi of the land of Nirdun and the
     tribute of the land of Urumi-sa Bitani, of the Princes of
     the land of Nairi,
14   chariots, horses, horses for the yoke, tin, silver, gold, <emphasis>kam</emphasis>
     of copper, oxen, sheep, goats.
15   Over the land of Nairi I established a viceroy: (but) on
     my return the land of Nairi, and Nirbu which is in
16   the land of Kasyari, revolted; nine of their cities leagued
     themselves with Ispilipri one of their fortified towns and
     to a mountain difficult of access
17   they trusted; but the heights of the hill I besieged and
     took; in the midst of the strong mountain their fighting
     men I slew; their corpses like rubbish on the hills
18   I piled up; their common people in the tangled hollows of
     the mountains I consumed; their spoil, their property I
     carried off; the heads of their soldiers
19   I cut off; a pile (of them) in the highest part of the city I
     built; their boys and maidens I dishonored; to the environs
     of the city Buliyani
20   I passed; the banks of the river Lukia[1] I took possession
     of; in my passage I occupied the towns of the land of
     Kirhi hard by; many of their warriors
21   I slew; their spoil I spoiled; their cities with fire I burned:
     to the city of Ardupati I went. In those days the tribute
22   of Ahiramu son of Yahiru of the land of Nilaai son of Bahiani
     of the land of the Hittites[2] and of the Princes of the
     land of Hanirabi, silver, gold,
23   tin, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of copper, oxen, sheep, horses, as their tribute I
     received; in the eponym of Assuridin[3] they brought me
     intelligence that
24   Zab-yav Prince of the land of Dagara had revolted. The
     land of Zamua throughout its whole extent he boldly
     seized; near the city of Babite
25   they constructed a fort; for combat and battle they
     marched forth: in the service of Assur, the great god my
     Lord and the great Merodach
26   going before me,[4] by the powerful aid which the Lord
     Assur extended to my people, my servants and my soldiers
     I called together; to the vicinity
27   of Babite I marched: the soldiers to the valor of their army
     trusted and gave battle: but in the mighty force of the
     great Merodach going before me
28   I engaged in battle with them; I effected their overthrow:
     I broke them down; 1,460 of their warriors in the environs
29   I slew; Uzie, Birata, and Lagalaga, their strong towns,
     with 100 towns within their territory I captured;
30   their spoil, their youths, their oxen, and sheep I carried
     off; Zab-yav for the preservation of his life, a rugged
     mountain
31   ascended; 1,200 of their soldiers I carried off; from the
     land of Dagara I withdrew; to the city of Bara I approached;
     the city of Bara
32   I captured; 320 of their soldiers by my weapons I destroyed;
     their oxen, sheep, and spoil in abundance I removed;
33   300 of their soldiers I took off; on Tasritu[5] 15th from the
     town Kalzi I withdrew, and came to the environs of Babite;
34   from Babite I withdrew; to the land of Nizir which they
     call Lúlu-Kinaba I drew near; the city Bunasi one of their
     fortified cities
35   belonging to Musazina and 20 cities of their environs I
     captured; the soldiers were discouraged; they took possession
     of a mountain difficult of access; I, Assur-nasir-pal
     impetuously after them
36   like birds swooped down; their corpses lay thick on the
     hills of Nizir; 326 of their warriors I smote down; his
     horses I exacted of him,
37   their common people in the tangled hollows I consumed;
     seven cities in Nizir, which were of their duly appointed
     fortresses I captured; their soldiers
38   I slew; their spoil, their riches, their oxen, their sheep I
     carried off; the cities themselves I burned; to these my
     tents I returned to halt;
39   from those same tents I departed; to cities of the land of
     Nizir whose place no one had ever seen I marched; the city
     of Larbusa
40   the fortified city of Kirtiara and 8 cities of their territory
     I captured; the soldiers lost heart and took to a steep
     mountain, a mountain (which) like sharp iron stakes
41   rose high upward; as for his soldiers, I ascended after them;
     in the midst of the mountain I scattered their corpses; 172
     of their men I slew; soldiers
42   in numbers in the hollows of the mountain I hunted down;
     their spoil, their cattle, their sheep, I took away; their
     cities with fire
43   I burned; their heads on the high places of the mountain
     I lifted up;[6] their boys and maidens I dishonored; to the
     tents aforesaid I returned to halt;
44   from those same tents I withdrew; 150 cities of the territory
     of Larbusai, Durlulumai, Bunisai and Barai I captured;
45   their fighting men I slew; their spoil I spoiled; the city of
     Hasabtal I razed (and) burned with fire; 50 soldiers of
     Barai I slew in battle on the plain.
46   In those days the Princes of the entire land of Zamua were
     overwhelmed by the dread of the advance of Assur my
     Lord and submitted to my yoke; horses, silver, gold,
47   I received; the entire land under a Prefect I placed; horses,
     silver, gold, wheat, barley, submission, I imposed upon
     them
48   from the city of Tuklat-assur-azbat I withdrew; the land
     of Nispi accepted my yoke; I went down all night; to cities
     of remote site in the midst of Nispi
49   which Zab-yav had established as his stronghold I went,
     took the city of Birutu and consigned it to the flames.
     In the eponym of Damiktiya-tuklat, when I was stationed
     at Nineveh, they brough me news[7]
50   that Amaka, and Arastua withheld the tribute and vassalage
     due to Assur my Lord. In honor of Assur mighty
     Lord and Merodach the great going before me,
51   on the first of May[8] I prepared for the third time an
     expedition against Zamua: my fighting men[9] before the
     many chariots I did not consider: from Kalzi I withdrew;
     the lower Zab
52   I passed; to the vicinity of Babite I proceeded; the river
     Radanu at the foot of the mountains of Zima, my birthplace,
     I approached; oxen,
53   sheep, goats, as the tribute of Dagara I received: near
     Zimaki I added my strong chariots and battering rams as
     chief of warlike implements to my magazines; by night
54   and daybreak I went down; the Turnat in rafts I crossed;
     to Amali the strong city of Arastu I approached;
55   with vigorous assault the city I besieged and took; 800
     of their fighting men I destroyed by my weapons; I filled
     the streets of their city with their corpses;
56   their many houses I burned; many soldiers I took alive;
     their spoil in abundance I carried off; the city I overthrew
     razed and burnt with fire; the city Khudun
57   and 20 cities in its environs I took; their soldiers I slew;
     their booty in cattle and sheep I carried off; their cities I
     overthrew razed and burned; their boys
58   their maidens I dishonored; the city of Kisirtu a fortified
     city of Zabini with 10 neighboring cities I took; their soldiers
     I slew; their spoil
59   I carried off; the cities of Barai and Kirtiara, Bunisai together
     with the province of Khasmar I overthrew razed and
     burned with fire;
60   I reduced the boundaries to a heap, and then from the
     cities of Arastua I withdrew: to the neighborhood of the
     territory of Laara and Bidirgi, rugged land, which for the
     passage
61   of chariots and an army was not adapted, I passed; to the
     royal city Zamri of Amika of Zamua I drew near; Amika
     from before the mighty prowess of my formidable attack
62   fled in fear and took refuge on a hill difficult of access: I
     brought forth the treasures of his palace and his chariot;
     from Zamri I withdrew and passed the river Lallu and to
     the mountains of Etini,
63   difficult ground, unfit for the passage of chariots and
     armies, whither none of the Princes my sires had ever penetrated;
     I marched in pursuit of his army on the mountains
     of Etini:
64   the hill I ascended: his treasure, his riches, vessels of copper,
     abundance of copper, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of copper, bowls of copper,
     pitchers of copper, the treasures of his palace and of his
     storehouses,
65   from within the mountains I took away to my camp and
     made a halt: by the aid of Assur and the Sun-god, the gods
     in whom I trust, from that camp I withdrew and proceeded
     on my march;
66   the river Edir I passed on the confines of Soua and Elaniu,
     powerful lands; their soldiers I slew in numbers; their
     treasure, their riches, <emphasis>am</emphasis>[10] of copper,
67   <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of copper, <emphasis>sapli</emphasis> and <emphasis>namziete</emphasis> of copper,
     vessels of copper
     in abundance, <emphasis>pásur</emphasis> wood, gold and <emphasis>ahzi</emphasis>, their oxen,
     sheep, riches,
68   his abundant spoil, from below the mountains of Elani, his
     horses, I exacted from him: Amika for the saving of his
     life to the land of Sabue went up;
69   the cities Zámru, Arazitku, Amaru, Parsindu, Eritu, Zuritu
     his fortified city, with 150 cities
70   of his territory I overthrew, razed, burned; the boundary
     I reduced to a heap.
     While in the vicinity of Parsindi I was stationed, the warlike
     engines of the tribe of Kallabu
71   came forth against the place; 150 of the fighting men of
     Amika I slew in the plain; their heads I cut off and put
     them up on the heights of his palace;
72   200 of his soldiers taken by (my) hands alive I left to rot
     on the wall of his palace:[11] from Zamri the battering-rams
     and … my banners I made ready;
73   to the fortress Ata, of Arzizai, whither none of the Kings
     my sires had ever penetrated I marched: the cities of Arzizu,
     and Arzindu
74   his fortified city, with ten cities situated in their environs
     in the midst of Nispi a rugged country, I captured; their
     soldiers I slew the cities I overthrew razed and burned with
     fire:
75   to those my tents I returned. In those days I received copper,
     <emphasis>tabbili</emphasis> of copper, <emphasis>kanmate</emphasis> of copper, and <emphasis>sariete</emphasis>
     as the tribute of the land of Siparmina, such as women
76   collect: from the city of Zamri I withdrew; to Lara, (the
     rugged hill-country, unfitted for the passage of chariots and
     armies, with instruments [axes] of iron I cut through and
77   with rollers of metal I beat down) with the chariots and
     troops I brought over to the city of Tiglath-assur-azbat in
     the land of Lulu—the city of Arakdi they call it—I went
     down;
78   the Kings of Zamue, the whole of them, from before the
     impetuosity of my servants and the greatness of my power
     drew back and accepted my yoke; tribute of silver, gold,
     tin,
79   copper, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of copper, vestments of wool, horses, oxen,
     sheep, goats, in addition to what I had before settled, I imposed
     upon them; a Viceroy
80   in Kalach I created. While in the land of Zamue I was
     stationed the cities Khudunai, Khartisai, Khutiskai Kirzanai
81   were overwhelmed by fear of the advance of Assur my
     Lord; impost, tribute, silver, gold, horses, vestments of
     wool, oxen, sheep, goats, they brought to me; the rebel
     soldiers
82   fled from before my arms; they fled to the mountains; I
     marched after them; within confines of the land of Aziru
     they settled and got ready the city of Mizu as their strong
     place;
83   the land of Aziru I overthrew and destroyed; from Zimaki
     as far as the Turnat I scattered their corpses; 500 of their
     fighting men I destroyed;
84   their spoil in abundance I carried off.
     In those days in the land of Samua, (in which is) the
     city of Atlila which Zibir King of Kardunias had taken,
     devastated,
85   and reduced to a heap of ruins, I Assur-nasir-pal King of
     Assyria took, after laying siege to its castle a second time;
     the palace as a residence for My Majesty I therein strengthened,
     made princely and enlarged beyond what of old was
     planned;
86   the wheat and barleys of the land of Kalibi I accumulated
     therein; I gave it the name of Dur-Assur.
     On the first of May in the eponym of Sanmapakid[12] I
     collected my chariots and soldiers
87   the Tigris I crossed; to the land of Commagene I passed
     on; I inaugurated a palace in the city of Tiluli; the tribute
     due from Commagene I received; from Commagene I
     withdrew;
88   I passed on to the land of the Istarat;[13] in the city of Kibaki
     I halted; from Kibaki I received oxen, sheep, goats,
     and copper; from Kibaki I withdrew;
89   to the city of Mattyati I drew nigh; I took possession of
     the land of Yatu with the town Kapranisa; 2,800 of their
     fighting men I smote down with my weapons; their spoil
     in abundance I carried off;
90   the rebels who had fled from before my arms now accepted
     my yoke; of their cities I left them in possession; tribute
     impost and an officer[14] over them I set;
91   an image of my person I made; collected laws I wrote upon
     it and in the city of Mattiyati I placed it; from Mattiyati I
     withdrew; at the city of Zazabuka
92   I halted; the tribute of Calach in oxen, sheep, goats and
     various copper articles I received; from Zazabuka I withdrew;
93   at the city of Irzia I made a halt; that city I burned; but
     received there the tributes due from Zura in oxen, sheep,
     goats and <emphasis>kam</emphasis> copper:
94   from Izria I withdrew; in the land of Kasyari I halted;
     Madara (and) Anzi two cities of the territory I captured
     and slew their soldiers;
95   their spoil I carried off; the cities I burned with fire; six
     lakes I crossed over in Kasyari, a rugged highland for the
     passage of chariots and an army
96   unsuited; (the hills with instruments of iron I cut through
     [and] with rollers of metal I beat down;) the chariots and
     army I brought over. In a city of Assur[15] on the sandy
     side which is in Kasyari,
97   oxen, sheep, goats <emphasis>kam</emphasis> and <emphasis>gurpisi</emphasis> of copper I received;
     by the land of Kasyari I proceeded; a second time to the
     land of Nairi I went down; at the city of Sigisa
98   I made a halt; from Sigisa I withdrew; to Madara the
     fortified city of Labduri the son of Dubisi I drew near, a
     city extremely strong with four impregnable castles;
99   the city I besieged; they quailed before my mighty
     prowess; I received, for the preservation of their lives,
     their treasures, their riches, their sons, by tale; I imposed
     upon them
100  tribute and duties; an officer[16] I appointed over them; the
     city I demolished, razed, and reduced to a heap of ruins;
     from Madara I withdrew; to Tuskha
101  I passed over; a palace in Tuskha I dedicated; the tribute
     of the land of Nirdun, horses, yoke-horses, fish, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of
     copper, <emphasis>gurpisi</emphasis> of copper, oxen, sheep,
102  goats, in Tuskha I received; 60 cities and strong castles
     below Kasyari, belonging to Labduri son of Dubuzi
     I overthrew razed and converted to a heap of ruins.
103  In the service of Assur my Lord from Tuskha I withdrew.
     The powerful chariots and battering-rams I put
     up in my stores; on rafts
104  I passed the Tigris; all night I descended; to Pitura a
     strong town of Dirrai I drew near—a very strong city—
105  two forts facing each other, whose castle like the
     summit of a mountain stood up: by the mighty hands of
     Assur my Lord and the impetuosity of my army and my
     formidable attack
106  I gave them battle; on two days before sunrise like Yav
     the inundator I rushed upon them; destruction upon them
     I rained with the might[17]
107  and prowess of my warriors; like the rush of birds coming
     upon them, the city I captured; 800 of their soldiers by
     my arms I destroyed; their heads
108  I cut off; many soldiers I captured in hand alive; their
     populace in the flames I burned; their spoil I carried off
     in abundance; a trophy of the living and of heads
109  about his great gate I built;[18] 700 soldiers I there impaled
     on stakes;[19] the city I overthrew, razed, and reduced to
     a heap of ruins all round; their boys,
110  their maidens, I dishonored; the city of Kukunu[20] facing
     the mountains of Matni I captured; 700 of their fighting
     men I smote down with my weapons;
111  their spoil in abundance I carried off; 50 cities of Dira I
     occupied; their soldiers I slew; I plundered them; 50 soldiers
     I took alive; the cities I overthrew
112  razed and burned; the approach of my Royalty overcame
     them; from Pitura I withdrew, and went down to Arbaki
     in Gilhi-Bitani;
113  they quailed before the approach of my Majesty, and deserted
     their towns and strong places: for the saving of
     their lives they went up to Matni a land of strength
114  I went after them in pursuit; 1,000 of their warriors I left
     in the rugged hills; their corpses on a hill I piled up;
     with their bodies the tangled hollows
115  of the mountains I filled; I captured 200 soldiers and cut
     off their hands; their spoil I carried away; their oxen,
     their sheep
116  without number, I took away; Iyaya, Salaniba, strong
     cities of Arbaki I occupied; the soldiers I slew; their spoil
     I carried off
117  250 towns surrounded with strong walls in the land of
     Nairi I overthrew demolished and reduced to heaps and
     ruins; the trees of their land I cut down; the wheat
118  and barley in Tuskha I kept. Ammiba'al the son of
     Zamani had been betrayed and slain by his nobles.[21] To
     revenge Ammiba'al
119  I marched; from before the vehemence of my arms and
     the greatness of my Royalty
120  they drew back: his swift chariots, trappings for men and
     horses one hundred in number,
121  horses, harness, his yokes, tribute of silver and gold with
     100 talents
122  in tin, 100 talents in copper, 300 talents in <emphasis>annui</emphasis>, 100 <emphasis>kam</emphasis>
     of copper, 3,000 <emphasis>kappi</emphasis> of copper, bowls of copper, vessels
     of copper,
123  1,000 vestments of wool, <emphasis>nui</emphasis> wood, <emphasis>eru</emphasis> wood, <emphasis>zalmalli</emphasis>
     wood, horns, choice gold,
124  the treasures of his palace, 2,000 oxen, 5,000 sheep, his
     wife, with large donations from her; the daughters
125  of his chiefs with large donations from them I received.
     I, Assur-nasir-pal, great King, mighty King, King of legions,
     King of Assyria,
126  son of Tuklat-Adar great and mighty King, King of
     legions, King of Assyria, noble warrior, in the strength of
     Assur his Lord walked, and whose equal among the
     Kings
127  of the four regions exists not;[22] a King who from beyond
     the Tigris up to Lebanon and the Great Sea
128  hath subjugated the land of Laki in its entirety, the land
     of Zuhi with the city of Ripaki: from the sources of
     the Ani
129  (and) the Zupnat to the land bordering on Sabitan has he
     held in hand: the territory of Kirrouri with Kilzani on the
     other side the Lower Zab
130  to Tul-Bari which is beyond the country of the Zab; beyond
     the city of Tul-sa-Zabdani, Hirimu, Harute, the land
     of Birate
131  and of Kardunias I annexed to the borders of my realm
     and on the broad territory of Nairi I laid fresh tribute.
     The city of Calach I took anew; the old mound
132  I threw down; to the top of the water I brought it; 120
     hand-breadths in depth I made it good; a temple to Ninip
     my Lord I therein founded; when
133  an image of Ninip himself which had not been made before,
     in the reverence of my heart for his great mighty god-ship,
     of mountain stone and brilliant gold I caused to make
     in its completeness;
134  for my great divinity in the city of Calach I accounted
     him: his festivals in the months of January and September[23]
     I established: Bit-kursi which was unoccupied I
     closed:
135  an altar to Ninip my Lord I therein consecrated: a temple
     for Beltis, Sin, and Gulanu, Hea-Manna[24] and Yav
     great ruler of heaven and earth I founded.</p>

<p>l    On the 22d day of the third month, May,[1] in the eponym

11   whose tribute in silver, gold, tin, <emphasis>kami</emphasis>, oxen, sheep, I
     received and withdrew from it;
12   near Khindani, situated on the nearer banks of the Euphrates
     I halted;
13   the tribute of Khindani, silver, gold, tin, <emphasis>kami</emphasis>, oxen, sheep,
     I received. From Khindani
14   I withdrew; at the mountains over against the Euphrates[5]
     I halted; I withdrew from those mountains and halted at
     Bit-Sabáya near the town of Haridi
15   situate on the nearer bank of the Euphrates. From Bit-Sabáya
     I withdrew; at the commencement of the town of
     Anat[6]
16   I made a halt. Anat is situated in the midst of the Euphrates.
     From Anat I withdrew. The city of Zuru the
     fortified city of
17   Sadudu of the land of Zuhi I besieged: to the numerous
     warriors of the spacious land of the Kassi he trusted and
     to make war and battle to my presence advanced;
l8   the city I besieged; two days I was engaged in fighting; I
     made good an entrance: (then) through fear[7] of my
     mighty arms Sadudu and his soldiers
19   for the preservation of his life, into the Euphrates threw
     himself: I took the city; 50 <emphasis>bit-hallu</emphasis>[8] and their soldiers
     in the service of Nabu-bal-idin King of Kardunias;
20   Zabdanu his brother with 300 of his soldiers and Bel-bal-idin
     who marched at the head of their armies I captured,
     together with them
21   many soldiers I smote down with my weapons; silver, gold,
     tin, precious stone of the mountains,[9] the treasure of his
     palace,
22   chariots, horses trained to the yoke, trappings for men and
     horses, the women of his palace, his spoil,
23   in abundance I carried off; the city I pulled down and razed;
     ordinances and edicts I imposed on Zuhi; the fear of my
     dominion to Kardunias reached;
24   the greatness of my arms overwhelmed Chaldæa;[10] on the
     countries of the banks of the Euphrates my impetuous
     soldiers I sent forth; an image
25   of my person I made; decrees and edicts upon it I inscribed;
     in Zuri I put it up, I Assur-nasir-pal, a King who
     has enforced his laws
26   (and) decrees and who to the sword hath directed his face
     to conquests and alliances hath raised his heart. While
     I was stationed at Calach
27   they brought me news that the population of Laqai and
     Khindanu of the whole land of Zukhi had revolted and
     crossed the Euphrates
28   on the eighteenth of May[11] I withdrew from Calach; passed
     the Tigris, took the desert to Zúri
29   by Bit-Halupí I approached in ships belonging to me which
     I had taken at Zúri: I took my way to the sources of the
     Euphrates;
30   the narrows of the Euphrates I descended, the cities of
     Khintiel and Aziel in the land of Laqai I took; their soldiers
     I slew; their spoil
31   I carried off; the cities I overthrew, razed, burned with
     fire. In my expedition marching westward of the banks of
     the Chaboras to
32   the city Zibate of Zuhi, cities on the other side of the
     Euphrates in the land of Laqai I overthrew, devastated and
     burned with fire; their crops I seized 460 soldiers
33   their fighting men by (my) weapons I destroyed; I took
     20 alive and impaled them on stakes;[12] on ships which I
     had built—
34   in 20 ships which were drawn up on the sand at Haridi
     I crossed the Euphrates. The land of Zuhaya and Laqai
35   and the city of Khindanai[13] to the power of their chariots
     armies and hands trusted and summoned 6,000 of their
     soldiers to engage in fight and battle.
36   They came to close quarters; I fought with them; I
     effected their overthrow; I destroyed their chariots 6,500
     of their warriors I smote down by my weapons; the remainder
37   in starvation in the desert of the Euphrates I shut up.
     From Haridi in Zukhi to Kipina and the cities of Khin-danai[13]
38   in Laqai on the other side I occupied; their fighting men
     I slew; the city I overthrew razed and burned. Aziel of
     Laqai
39   trusted to his forces and took possession of the heights
     of Kipina; I gave them battle; at the city of Kipina I
     effected his overthrow; 1,000 of his warriors I slew;
40   his chariots I destroyed; spoil I carried off in plenty;
     their gods I took away; for the preservation of his life he
     took refuge on a rugged hill of Bizuru at the sources of
     the Euphrates;
41   for two days I descended the river in pursuit: the relics
     of his army with my weapons I destroyed; their hiding
     place by the hills on the Euphrates I broke up;
42   to the cities of Dumite and Azmú belonging to the son of
     Adini[14] I went down after him; his spoil, his oxen, his
     sheep,
43   which like the stars of heaven were without number I
     carried off.
     In those days Ila of Laqai, his swift chariots and 500
     soldiers
44   to my land of Assyria I transported; Dumutu and Azmu
     I captured, overthrew, razed and burned; in the narrows of
     the Euphrates I turned aside in my course and
45   I outflanked Aziel, who fled before my mighty power to
     save his life. Ila; the Prince of Laqai, his army his chariots,
     his harness,
46   I carried off and took to my city of Assur: Khimtiel of
     Laqai I made prisoner in his own city. Through the might
     of Assur my Lord, (and) in the presence of my mighty
     arms and the formidable attack
47   of my powerful forces he was afraid, and I received the
     treasures of his palaces, silver, gold, tin, copper, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of
     copper, vestments of wool, his abundant spoil; and tribute
48   and impost in addition to what I had previously fixed I laid
     upon them; in those days I slew 50 buffaloes in the neighborhood
     of the nearer side of the Euphrates: eight buffaloes
     I caught alive;
49   I killed 20 eagles, and captured others alive: I founded two
     cities on the Euphrates; one on the farther bank
50   of the Euphrates which I named Dur-Assur-nasir-pal; one
     on the nearer bank which I named Nibarti-Assur. On the
     20th of May[16] I withdrew from Calach;
51   I crossed the Tigris; to the land of Bit-Adini I went; to
     their strong city of Katrabi I approached, a city exceedingly
     strong, like a storm rushing from heaven,[17]
52   the soldiers confided to their numerous troops, and would
     not submit and accept my yoke: in honor of Assur the great
     Lord, my Lord, and the god the great protector going before
     me, I besieged the city
53   by the warlike engines[18] on foot and strong, the city I
     captured; many of their soldiers I slew; 800 of their fighting
     men I dispersed; their spoil and property I carried off,
     2,400 of their warriors
54   I transported away and detained them at Calach; the city
     I overthrew razed and burnt; the fear of the approach of
     Assur my Lord over Bit-Adini I made good.
55   In those days the tribute of Ahuni son of Adini of Habini,
     of the city of Tul-Abnai,[19] silver, gold, tin,[20] copper,
     vestments of wool and linen, wood for bridges,
56   cedar wood, the treasures of his palace I received; their
     hostages I took, <emphasis>rimutu</emphasis>[21] I imposed upon them.
     In the month April[22] and on the eighth day I quitted
     Calach; the Tigris
57   I passed; to Carchemish[23] in Syria I directed my steps; to
     Bit-Bakhiani I approached; the tribute due from the son[24]
     of Bakhiani, swift chariots, horses, silver,
58   gold, tin, copper, <emphasis>kami</emphasis> of copper, I received; the chariots
     and warlike engines of the officer of the son of Bakhiani I
     added to my magazines;
59   I menaced the land of Anili: the tribute of Hu-immi of
     Nilaya, swift war chariots, horses, silver, gold, tin,[25]
     copper,
60   <emphasis>kami</emphasis> of copper, oxen, sheep, horses, I received; the
     chariots and warlike instruments of the officer I added to my
     magazines. From Anili I withdrew; to Bit-Adini I approached;
61   the tribute of Ahuni son of Adini, silver, gold, tin,[5] copper,
     wood of <emphasis>ereru</emphasis> and <emphasis>rabaz</emphasis>, horns, <emphasis>sai</emphasis>-wood, horns[26]
62   of thrones horns of silver, and gold, <emphasis>sari</emphasis>, bracelets of gold,
     <emphasis>sahri</emphasis> fastenings for covers of gold, scabbards of gold, oxen,
     sheep, goats as his tribute I received;
63   the chariots and warlike engines of the officer of Ahuni I
     added to my magazines. In those days I received the tribute
     of Habini of Tul-Abnai, four maneh of silver and 400
     sheep;
64   ten maneh of silver for his first year as tribute I imposed
     upon him: from Bit-Adini I withdrew; the Euphrates, in a
     difficult part of it, I crossed in ships of hardened skins:
65   I approached the land of Carchemish: the tribute of Sangara
     King of Syria, twenty talents of silver, <emphasis>sahri</emphasis> gold, bracelets
     of gold, scabbards of gold, 100 talents
66   of copper, 250 talents of annui <emphasis>kami, harlate, nirmakate
     kibil</emphasis>[27] of copper, the extensive furniture of his palace,
67   of incomprehensible perfection[28] different kinds of woods,[29]
     <emphasis>ka</emphasis> and <emphasis>sara</emphasis>, 200 female slaves, vestments of wool,
68   and linen; beautiful black coverings, beautiful purple coverings,
     precious stones, horns of buffaloes, white[30] chariots,
     images of gold, their coverings, the treasures of his
     Royalty, I received of him;
69   the chariots and warlike engines of the General of Carchemish
     I laid up in my magazines; the Kings of all those
     lands who had come out against me received my yoke; their
     hostages I received;
70   they did homage in my presence; to the land of Lebanon[31]
     I proceeded. From Carchemish I withdrew and marched
     to the territory of Munzigani and Harmurga:
71   the land of Ahanu I reduced; to Gaza[32] the town of Lubarna[33]
     of the Khatti I advanced; gold and vestments of
     linen I received:
72   crossing the river Abrie I halted and then leaving that
     river approached the town of Kanulua a royal city belonging
     to Lubarna of the Khatti:
73   from before my mighty arms and my formidable onset he
     fled in fear, and for the saving of his life submitted to my
     yoke; twenty talents of silver, one talent of gold,
74   100 talents in tin, 100 talents in <emphasis>annui</emphasis>, 1,000 oxen, 10,000
     sheep, 1,000 vestments of wool, linen, <emphasis>nimati</emphasis> and <emphasis>ki</emphasis>
     woods coverings,
75   <emphasis>ahuzate</emphasis> thrones, <emphasis>kui</emphasis> wood, wood for seats, their
     coverings, <emphasis>sarai, zueri</emphasis>-wood, horns of <emphasis>kui</emphasis> in abundance,
     the numerous utensils of his palace, whose beauty
76   could not be comprehended:[34] … <emphasis>pagatu</emphasis>(?)[35] from
     the wealth of great Lords as his tribute
77   I imposed upon him; the chariots and warlike engines of
     the land of the Khatti I laid up in my magazines; their
     hostages I took.
     In those days (I received) the tribute of Guzi
78   of the land of Yahanai, silver, gold, tin,[36] … oxen,
     sheep, vestments of wool and linen I received: from Kunalua
     the capital of Lubarna I withdrew,
79   of the land of the Khatti, crossed the Orontes,[37] and after
     a halt left it, and to the borders
80   of the land of Yaraki and of Yahturi I went round: the
     land[38] … had rebelled: from the Sangura after a
     halt I withdrew;
81   I made a detour to the lands of Saratini and Girpani[39]
     … I halted and advanced to Aribue a fortified city
     belonging to Lubarna of the land of the Khatti:
82   the city I took to myself; the wheats and barleys of Luhuti
     I collected; I allowed his palace to be sacked and settled
     Assyrians there.[40]
83   While I was stationed at Aribua, I captured the cities of the
     land of Luhiti and slew many of their soldiers; overthrew
     razed and burned them with fire;
84   the soldiers whom I took alive I impaled on stakes close
     by their cities.
     In those days I occupied the environs of Lebanon; to the
     great sea
85   of Phoenicia[41] I went up: up to the great sea my arms I
     carried: to the gods I sacrificed; I took tribute of the
     Princes of the environs of the sea-coast,
86   of the lands of Tyre, Sidon, Gebal, Maacah[42] Maizai Kaizai,
     of Phoenicia and Arvad
87   on the sea-coast—silver, gold, tin, copper, <emphasis>kam</emphasis> of copper,
     vestments of wool and linen, <emphasis>pagutu</emphasis>[43] great and small,
88   strong timber, wood of <emphasis>ki</emphasis>[44] teeth of dolphins, the produce
     of the sea, I received as their tribute: my yoke they accepted;
     the mountains of Amanus[45] I ascended; wood for
     bridges,
89   pines, box, cypress, <emphasis>li</emphasis>-wood, I cut down; I offered sacrifices
     for my gods; a trophy[46] of victory I made, and in a
     central place I erected it;
90   <emphasis>gusuri</emphasis>-wood, cedar wood from Amanus I destined for
     Bit-Hira,
     and my pleasure house called Azmaku, for the temple
     of the Moon and Sun the exalted gods.
91   I proceeded to the land of Iz-mehri, and took possession
     of it throughout: I cut down beams for bridges of <emphasis>mehri</emphasis>
     trees, and carried them to Nineveh; (and)
92   to Istar Lady of Nineveh (on) my knees I knelt.[47] In the
     eponym of Samas-nuri[48] in the honor of the great Lord
     Assur my Lord on the 20th of April[49]
93   from Calach I withdrew—crossed the Tigris—descended
     to the land of Kipani, and there, in the city of Huzirina,
     received the tribute of the governors of its cities.
94   While stationed at Huzirana I received the tribute of
     Ittiel of Nilaya, Giridadi of Assaya, in silver
95   gold, oxen, sheep. In those days I received the tribute in
     beams for bridges, cedar wood, silver, gold of Qatuzili
96   of Commagene[50]—withdrew from Huzirina and took my
     way upward along the banks of the Euphrates; to Kubbu.[51]
97   I crossed over into the midst of the towns of Assa in
     Kirkhi over against Syria. The cities of Umalie and
     Khiranu
98   powerful cities centrally situated in Adani I captured; numbers
     of their soldiers I slew; spoil beyond reckoning
99   I carried off; the towns I overthrew and demolished; 150
     cities of their territory I burned with fire; then from Khiranu
100  I withdrew; I passed over to the environs of the land of
     Amadani; I went down among the cities of Dirrie, and
     the cities within the lands of
101  Amadani and Arquanie I burned with fire: Mallanu which
     is in the middle of Arquanie I took as my own possession;
     I withdrew from Mallanu
102  to the cities of Zamba on the sandy outskirt, which I
     burned with fire: I passed the river Sua, proceeding up
     to the Tigris whose cities
103  on those banks and on these banks of the Tigris in Arkanie
     to a heap I reduced: its waters overflowed all Kirkhi: my
     yoke they took;
104  their hostages I exacted; a Viceroy of my own I appointed
     over them: in the environs of the land of Amadani I
     arrived: at Barza-Nistun
105  To Dandamusa the fortified city of Ilani son of Zamani
     I drew near and laid siege to it: my warriors like birds
     of prey rushed upon them;
106  600 of their warriors I put to the sword and decapitated;
     400 I took alive;
107  3,000 captives I brought forth; I took possession of the
     city for myself: the living soldiers, and heads to the city
     of Amidi[52] the royal city, I sent;
108  heaps of the heads close by his great gate I piled; the
     living soldiers I crucified on crosses[53] at the gates of the
     town;
109  inside the gates I made carnage; their forests I cut down;[54]
     from Amidi I withdrew toward the environs of Kasyari;
     the city of Allabzie
110  to whose rocks and stones no one among the Kings my
     fathers had ever made approach, I penetrated; to the town
     of Uda the fortress of Labduri son of Dubuzi
111  I approached and besieged the city with <emphasis>bilsi</emphasis>(?) strengthened
     and marching; the city I captured;[55] … soldiers[56] … with my
     weapons I destroyed; 570 soldiers
112  I captured; 3,000 captives I took forth; soldiers alive I
     caught; some I impaled on stakes;[57] of others
113  the eyes I put out: the remainder I carried off to Assur
     and took the city as my own possession—I who am Assur-nasir-pal
     mighty King, King of Assyria son of Tuklat-Adar, (Tuklat-Ninip)
114  great King, powerful King, King of legions, King of
     Assyria son of Vul-nirari[58] great King, mighty King,
     King of legions, King of Assyria, noble warrior, who in
     the service of Assur his Lord proceeded, and among the
     Kings of the four regions,
115  has no equal, a Prince[59] (giving) ordinances, not fearing
     opponents, mighty unrivalled leader, a Prince subduer of
     the disobedient, who all
116  the thrones of mankind has subdued; powerful King
     treading over the heads of his enemies, trampling on the
     lands of enemies, breaking down the assemblages of the
     wicked; who in the service of the great gods
117  his Lords marched along; whose hand hath taken possession
     of all their lands, laid low the forests of all of them,
     and received their tributes, taking hostages (and) imposing
     laws
118  upon all those lands; when Assur the Lord proclaimer
     of my name, aggrandizer of my Royalty, who added his
     unequivocal service to the forces of my government
119  I destroyed the armies of the spacious land of Lúlumi.
     In battle by weapons I smote them down. With the help
     of the Sun-god
120  and Yav, the gods in whom I trust, I rushed upon the
     armies of Nairi, Kirkhi Subariya and Nirbi like Yav the
     inundator;[60]
121  a King who from the other side the Tigris to the land of
     Lebanon and the great sea has subjugated to his yoke the
     entire land of Lakie and the land of Zukhi as far as the
     city Rapik;
122  to whose yoke is subjected (all) from the sources of the
     Zupnat to the frontiers of Bitani; from the borders of
     Kirruri to Kirzani;
123  from beyond the Lower Zab to the town of Tulsa-Zabdani
     and the town of Tul-Bari beyond the land of Zaban as far
     as the towns of Tul-sa-Zabdani and
124  Tul-sa-Abtani; Harimu, Harutu in Birate of Kardunias[61]
     to the borders of my land I added; (the inhabitants) of
     the territory of Babite
125  with Khasmar among the people of my own country I
     accounted: in the countries which I held I established a
     deputy: they performed homage: submission
126  I imposed upon them; I, Assur-nasir-pal, great, noble, worshipper
     of the great gods, generous, great, mighty
     possessors of cities and the forests of all their domains,
     King of Lords, consumer of
127  the wicked <emphasis>taskaru</emphasis> invincible, who combats injustice,
     Lord of all Kings, King of Kings, glorious, upholder of
     Bar (Ninip) the warlike, worshipper
128  of the great gods, a King who, in the service of Assur
     and Ninip, gods in whom he trusted, hath marched royally,
     and wavering lands and Kings his enemies in all their
     lands
129  to his yoke hath subdued, and the rebels against Assur,
     high and low, hath opposed and imposed on them impost
     and tribute—Assur-nasir-pal
130  mighty King, glory of the Moon-god[62] worshipper of Anu,
     related[63] to Yav, suppliant of the gods, an unyielding
     servant, destroyer of the land of his foes; I, a King vehement
     in war,
131  destroyer of forests and cities, chief over opponents, Lord
     of four regions, router of his enemies in strong lands and
     forests, and who Kings mighty and fearless from the rising
132  to the setting of the sun to my yoke subjugated.</p>

<p>The following translations are some of those which I published in the

the Assyrians had a firm belief in the immortality of the soul: a fact
which was previously unknown.</p>
<p>I have added specimens of their penitential psalms, and some notices of
their numerous superstitions, such as the exorcism of evil spirits, the
use of magic knots and talismans, the belief in inherited or imputed sins,
and in the great degree of holiness which they attributed to the number
<emphasis>Seven</emphasis>. In some of these respects we may evidently see how great an
influence was exercised on the mind and belief of the Jews by their long
residence at Babylon.</p>

<p><strong>ASSYRIAN TALISMANS AND EXORCISMS TRANSLATED BY H.F. TALBOT, F.R.S.</strong></p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>DEMONIACAL POSSESSION AND EXORCISM</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Diseases were attributed to the influence of Evil Spirits. Exorcisms were
used to drive away those tormentors: and this seems to have been the sole
remedy employed, for I believe that no mention has been found of medicine.</p>
<p>This is a very frequent subject of the tablets. [Footnote: Taken from 2 R
pl. 18.] One of them says of a sick man:</p>
<p>1  "May the goddess …
2  wife of the god …
3  turn his face in another direction;
4  that the evil spirit may come out of him
5  and be thrust aside, and that Good Spirits and Good Powers
6  may dwell in his body!"</p>
<p>Sometimes divine images were brought into the chamber, and written texts
taken from holy books were placed on the walls and bound around the sick
man's brows. If these failed recourse was had to the influence of the
<emphasis>mamit</emphasis>, which the evil powers were unable to resist. On a tablet 2 R p.
17 the following is found, written in the Accadian language only, the
Assyrian version being broken off:</p>
<p>1  Take a white cloth: In it place the <emphasis>mamit</emphasis>,
2  in the sick man's right hand.
3  And take a black cloth:
4  wrap it round his left hand.
5  Then all the evil spirits.[1]
6  and the sins which he has committed
7  shall quit their hold of him,
8  and shall never return.[2]</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: A long list of them is given.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: "Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.," vol. ii. p. 56.]</p>
<p>The symbolism of the black cloth in the left hand seems evident. The dying
man repudiates all his former evil deeds. And he puts his trust in
holiness, symbolized by the white cloth in his right hand. Then follow
some obscure lines about the spirits—</p>
<p>  Their heads shall remove from his head:
  their hands shall let go his hands:
  their feet shall depart from his feet:</p>
<p>which perhaps may be explained thus—we learn, from another tablet, that
the various classes of evil spirits troubled different parts of the body.
Some injured the head, some the hands and feet, etc., etc. Therefore the
passage before us may mean: "The spirits whose power is over the hand,
shall loose their hands from his," etc. But I can offer no decided opinion
on such obscure points of their superstition.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>INHERITED OR IMPUTED SINS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>These were supposed to pursue a sick man and torment him. [Footnote: See</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia," vol. iv. p. 7.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1  The <emphasis>mamit</emphasis> for him reveal! The <emphasis>mamit</emphasis> for him unfold![1]
2  Against the evil spirit, disturber of his body!
3  Whether it be the sin of his father:
4  or whether it be the sin of his mother:
5  or whether it be the sin of his elder brother:
6  or whether it be the sin of someone who is unknown![2]</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: A holy object, the nature of which has not been ascertained.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: "Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.," vol. ii, p. 58.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>MAGIC KNOTS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Justin Martyr, speaking of the Jewish exorcists, says "They use magic ties
or knots." A similar usage prevailed among the Babylonians. [Footnote 7:
Ibid., p. 54.] The god Marduk wishes to soothe the last moments of a dying
man. His father Hea says: Go my son!</p>
<p>1   Take a woman's linen kerchief
2   bind it round thy right hand! loose it from the left hand!
3   Knot it with seven knots: do so twice:
4   Sprinkle it with bright <emphasis>wine</emphasis>:
5   bind it round the head of the sick man:
6   bind it round his hands and feet, like manacles and fetters.
7   Sit down on his bed:
8   sprinkle holy water over him.
9   He shall hear the voice of Hea,
10  Davkina[1] shall protect him!
11  And Marduk, Eldest Son of heaven, shall find him a happy
    habitation![2]</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: One of the principal goddesses, the wife of the god Hea.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: "Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.," vol. ii. p. 84.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>TALISMANS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>To cure diseases they seem to have relied wholly on charms and
incantations.</p>
<p>The first step was to guard the entrance to the sick man's chamber.</p>
<p>A tablet says:</p>
<p>"That nothing evil may enter, place at the door the god (…) and the god
(…)."</p>
<p>That is to say, their images. I believe these were little figures of the
gods, brought by the priests, perhaps a sort of Teraphim.</p>
<p>The following line is more explicit: "Place the guardian statues of Hea
and Marduk at the door, on the right hand and on the left." But they added
to this another kind of protection:</p>
<p>1  Right and left of the threshold of the door, spread out holy
   texts and sentences.
2  Place on the statues texts bound around them.</p>
<p>These must have been long strips like ribbons of parchment or papyrus. The
following line is still clearer:</p>
<p>"In the night-time bind around the sick man's head a sentence taken from a
good book."[10]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: Similar to these were the phylacteries of the Jews, which
were considered to be protections from all evil. Schleusner in his Lexicon
of the New Testament says that they were "Strips of parchment on which
were written various portions of the Mosaic law, for the Jews believed
that these ligaments had power to avert every kind of evil, but especially
to drive away demons. as appears from the Targum on the Canticles," etc.
We see that the Babylonian precept was to bind holy sentences "around the
head" and others "right and left of the threshold of the door."</p>
<p>Cf. Deut. xi. 18: "Ye shall lay up these my words in your heart, and in
your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, and as frontlets
between your eyes.</p>
<p>"And thou shalt write them upon the door-posts of thine house, and upon
thy gates."]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>HOLINESS OF THE NUMBER SEVEN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Innumerable are the evidences of this opinion which are found on the
tablets. Two or three instances may suffice here:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THE SONG OF THE SEVEN SPIRITS [Footnote: "Trans. Soc. Bib. Arch.," vol.
ii. 2 p. 58.]</p>
<p>1  They are seven! they are seven!
2  In the depths of ocean they are seven!
3  In the heights of heaven they are seven!
4  In the ocean stream in a Palace they were born.
5  Male they are not: female they are not!
6  Wives they have not! Children are not born to them!
7  Rule they have not! Government they know not!
8  Prayers they hear not!
9  They are seven, and they are seven! Twice over they are
   seven!</p>
<p>This wild chant touches one of the deepest chords of their religious
feeling. They held that seven evil spirits at once might enter into a man:
there are frequent allusions to them, and to their expulsion, on the
tablets. One runs thus:</p>
<p>1  The god (…) shall stand by his bedside:
2  Those seven evil spirits he shall root out, and shall expel
   them from his body.
3  And those seven shall never return to the sick man again!</p>
<p>But sometimes this belief attained the grandeur of epic poetry. There is a
fine tale on one of the tablets [Footnote 2: "Cuneiform Inscriptions of
Western Asia," vol. iv. pl. 5.] of the seven evil spirits assaulting
heaven, and the gods alarmed standing upon the defensive, no doubt
successfully, but unluckily the conclusion of the story is broken off.</p>

<p><strong>ANCIENT BABYLONIAN CHARMS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The following are specimens of the imprecatory charms with which the
ancient Babylonian literature abounded, and which were supposed to be the
most potent means in the world for producing mischief. Some examples are
given in the first volume of the "Records of the Past," pp. 131-135 of the
exorcisms used to avert the consequences of such enchantments. The
original Accadian text is preserved in the first column with an
interlinear Assyrian translation: the short paragraphs in Column III also
give the Accadian original; but elsewhere the Assyrian scribe has
contented himself with the Assyrian rendering alone. The charms are
rhythmic, and illustrate the rude parallelism of Accadian poetry. The
Assyrian translations were probably made for the library of Sargon of
Aganè, an ancient Babylonian monarch who reigned not later than the
sixteenth century B.C.; but the copy we possess was made from the old
tablets by the scribes of Assur-bani-pal. The larger part of the first
column has already been translated by M. François Lenormant in "<emphasis>La Magie
chez les Chaldéens</emphasis>" p. 59. The tablet on which the inscription occurs is
marked K 65 in the British Museum Collection and will be published in the
"Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia," Vol. IV, plates 7, 8.</p>

4   The baneful charm is a spell that originates sickness.[4]

8   The voice <emphasis>that defiles</emphasis> like a hyena covers him and subjugates

9   Merodach[5] favors him; and
10  to his father Hea into the house he enters and cries:
11  "O my father, the baneful charm like an evil demon acts
    against the man."
12  To the injured (man) he (Hea) speaks thus:
13  "(A number) make: this man is unwitting: by means of
    the number he enslaves thee."
14  (To) his son Merodach he replies[6]
15  "My son, the number thou knowest not; the number let

<p><strong>INSCRIPTION OF TIGLATH PILESER I, KING OF ASSYRIA</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY SIR H. RAWLINSON, K.C.B., D.C.L., ETC.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This inscription of Tiglath Pileser I is found on an octagonal prism and
on some other clay fragments discovered at Kalah-Shergat and at present in
the British Museum. The text is published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions
of Western Asia," Vol. I, pp. ix-xvi. Four translations of this
inscription, made simultaneously in 1857 by Sir H. Rawlinson, Mr. Fox
Talbot, Dr. Hincks, and Dr. Oppert, were published in that year under the
title of "Inscription of Tiglath Pileser I, King of Assyria, B.C. 1150."
Dr. Oppert has also given a revised translation in his "<emphasis>Histoire de
l'Empire de Chaldée et d'Assyrie,</emphasis>" 8vo, Versailles, 1865, extracted from
the "<emphasis>Annales de la Philosophie chrétienne</emphasis>" of the same year, 5e Series,
p. 44 and foll. The translations simultaneously published were submitted
to the Asiatic Society in that year as a test of the advance made in
Assyrian interpretations and the close approximation made by scholars in
their interpretation of Assyrian texts. The notes contain some of the
different readings of the other Assyrian scholars at that time and give a
few of the principal varieties of reading some of the words. It was
generally considered a very triumphant demonstration of the sound basis on
which the then comparatively recent Assyrian researches were placed and a
confutation of certain opinions then prevalent, that no certain or
accurate advance had been made in the decipherment of Assyrian
inscriptions. On the whole for its extent and historical information
relating to the early history of Assyria this inscription is one of the
most important of the series showing the gradual advance and rise of
Assyria, while as one of the first interpreted it presents considerable
literary interest in respect to the details of the progress of Assyrian
interpretation. It is also nearly the oldest Assyrian text of any length
which has been hitherto discovered and is very interesting from its
account of the construction of the temples and palaces made by the King in
the early part of his reign.  S.B.</p>

<p>Ashur (and) the great gods, the guardians of my kingdom, who gave
government and laws to my dominions, and ordered an enlarged frontier to
their territory, having committed to (my) hand their valiant and warlike
servants, I have subdued the lands and the peoples and the strong places,
and the Kings who were hostile to Ashur; and I have reduced all that was
contained in them. With a host[1] of kings I have fought …[2] and have
imposed on them the bond of <emphasis>servitude</emphasis>. There is not to me a second in
war, nor an equal in battle. I have added territory to Assyria and peoples
to her people. I have enlarged the frontier of my territories, and subdued
all the lands contained in them.[3]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>In the beginning of my reign 20,000 of the <emphasis>Muskayans</emphasis>[1] and their 5
kings, who for 50 years had held the countries of Alza and Perukhuz,
without paying tribute and offerings to Ashur my Lord, and whom a King of
Assyria had never ventured to meet in battle betook themselves to their
strength, and went and seized the country of Comukha. In the service of
Ashur my Lord my chariots and warriors I assembled after me …[2] the
country of <emphasis>Kasiyaia</emphasis>[3] a difficult country, I passed through. With their
20,000 fighting men and their 5 kings in the country of Comukha I engaged.
I defeated them. The ranks of their warriors in fighting the battle were
beaten down as if by the tempest. Their carcasses covered the valleys and
the tops of the mountains. I cut off their heads. The battlements of their
cities I made heaps of, like mounds of <emphasis>earth</emphasis>, their movables, their
wealth, and their valuables I plundered to a countless amount. 6,000 of
their common soldiers who fled before my servants and accepted my yoke, I
took them, and gave them over to the men of my own territory.[4]</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: Sirki citizens. (Fox Talbot.)]</p>

<p>[Footnote 4: As slaves.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>VI</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Then I went into the country of <emphasis>Comukha,</emphasis>[1] which was disobedient and
withheld the tribute and offerings due to Ashur my Lord: I conquered the
whole country of Comukha. I plundered their movables, their wealth, and
their valuables. Their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed and ruined.
The common people of Comukha, who fled before the face of my servants,
crossed over to the city of <emphasis>Sherisha</emphasis>[2] which was on the further banks
of the Tigris, and made this city into their stronghold. I assembled my
chariots and warriors. I betook myself to <emphasis>carts of iron</emphasis>[3] in order to
overcome the rough mountains and their difficult marches. I made the
wilderness (thus) practicable for the passage of my chariots and warriors.
I crossed the Tigris and took the city of Sherisha their stronghold. Their
fighting men, in the middle of the forests, like wild beasts, I smote.
Their carcasses filled the Tigris, and the tops of the mountains. At this
time the troops of the <emphasis>Akhe</emphasis>,[4] who came to the deliverance and
assistance of Comukha, together with the troops of Comukha, like chaff I
scattered. The carcasses of their fighting men I piled up like heaps on
the tops of the mountains. The bodies of their warriors, the <emphasis>roaring</emphasis>[5]
waters carried down to the Tigris. Kili Teru son of Kali Teru, son of
Zarupin Zihusun, their King,[6] in the course of their fighting fell into
my power. His wives and his children, the delight of his heart I
dispossessed him of. One hundred and eighty[7] iron vessels and 5 trays of
copper, together with the gods of the people in gold and silver, and their
beds and furniture I brought away. Their movables and their wealth I
plundered. This city and its palace I burnt with fire, I destroyed and
ruined.</p>

<p>The city of <emphasis>Urrakluiras</emphasis> their stronghold which was in the country of
Panari, I went toward. The exceeding fear of the power of Ashur, my Lord,
overwhelmed them. To save their lives they took their gods, and fled like
birds to the tops of the lofty mountains. I collected my chariots and
warriors, and crossed the Tigris. <emphasis>Shedi Teru</emphasis>[1] the son of <emphasis>Khasutkh</emphasis>[2]
King of <emphasis>Urrakluiras</emphasis> on my arriving in his country submitted to my yoke.
His sons, the delight of his heart, and his favorites, I condemned to the
service of the gods: 60 vessels of iron; <emphasis>trays</emphasis>[3] and <emphasis>bars</emphasis> of copper
…[4] with 120 cattle, and flocks he brought as tribute and offerings. I
accepted (them) and spared him. I gave him his life, but imposed upon him
the yoke of my empire heavily forever. The wide spreading country of
Comukha I entirely conquered, and subjected to my yoke. At this time one
tray of copper and one bar of copper from among the service offerings and
tribute of Comukha I dedicated to Ashur my Lord, and 60 iron vessels with
their gods I offered to my guardian god, <emphasis>Vul</emphasis>.[5]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>From among my valiant servants, to whom Ashur the Lord gave strength and
power, in 30 of my chariots, select companies of my troops and bands of my
warriors who were expert in battle, I gathered together. I proceeded to
the extensive country of <emphasis>Miltis</emphasis>,[1] which did not obey me; it consisted
of strong mountains and a difficult land. Where it was easy I traversed it
in my chariots: where it was difficult I went on foot. In the country of
Aruma, which was a difficult land, and impracticable to the passage of my
chariots, I left the chariots and marched in front of my troops. Like
…[2] on the peak of the rugged mountains, I marched victoriously. The
country of <emphasis>Miltis</emphasis>,[1] like heaps of stubble, I swept. Their fighting men
in the course of the battle like chaff I scattered. Their movables, their
wealth and their valuables I plundered. Many of their cities I burned with
fire. I imposed on them <emphasis>religious service</emphasis>[1], and offerings and tribute.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>I subdued the extensive country of Subair, which was in rebellion. The
countries of Alza and Purukhuz, which deferred their tribute and
offerings, the yoke of my empire heavily upon them I imposed, decreeing
that they should bring their tribute and offerings into my presence in the
city of Ashur. While I was on this expedition, which the Lord Ashur,
committing to my hand a powerful rebel subduing army, ordered for the
enlargement of the frontiers of his territory, there were 4,000 of the
<emphasis>Kaskaya</emphasis> and <emphasis>Hurunaya</emphasis> rebellious tribes of the Kheti[1] who had brought
under their power the cities of Subarta, attached to the worship of Ashur,
my Lord (so that) they did not acknowledge dependence on Subarta. The
terror of my warlike expedition overwhelmed them. They would not fight,
but submitted to my yoke. Then I took their valuables, and 120[2] of their
chariots fitted to the yoke, and I gave them to the men of my own country.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>In the course of this my expedition, a second time I proceeded to the
country of Comukha. I took many of their cities. Their movables, their
wealth, and their valuables I plundered. Their cities I burnt with fire, I
destroyed and overthrew. The soldiers of their armies, who from before the
face of my valiant servants fled away, they would not engage with me in
the fierce battle: to save their lives they took to the stony heights of
the mountains, an inaccessible region: to the recesses of the deep forests
and the peaks of the difficult mountains which had never been trodden by
the feet of men, I ascended after them: they fought with me; I defeated
them: the ranks of their warriors on the tops of the mountains fell like
rain: their carcasses filled the ravines and the high places of the
mountains: their movables, their wealth, and their valuables I carried off
from the stony heights of the mountains. I subdued the country of Comukha
throughout its whole extent, and I attached it to the frontiers of my own
territory.</p>

<p>XIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In profound reverence to Ashur my Lord, to the country of Kharia, and the
far-spreading tribes of the Akhe, deep forests, which no former King (of
Assyria) had ever reached, the Lord Ashur invited me to proceed. My
chariots and forces I assembled, and I went to an inaccessible region
beyond the countries of Itni and Ayá. As the steep mountains stood up like
metal posts, and were impracticable to the passage of my chariots, I
placed my chariots in wagons, and (thus) I traversed the difficult ranges
of hills. All the lands of the Akhe and their wide-spreading tribes having
assembled, arose to do battle in the country of <emphasis>Azutapis</emphasis>. In an
inaccessible region I fought with them and defeated them. The ranks of
their (slain) warriors on the peaks of the mountains were piled up in
heaps; the carcasses of their warriors filled the ravines and high places
of the mountains. To the cities which were placed on the tops of the
mountains I <emphasis>penetrated</emphasis> victoriously: 27 cities of Kharía, which were
situated in the districts of Aya, Suira, Itni, Shetzu, Shelgu, Arzanibru,
Varutsu, and Anitku, I took; their movables, their wealth, and their
valuables I plundered; their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed and
overthrew.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XIV</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The people of Adavas feared to engage in battle with me; they left their
habitations, and fled like birds to the peaks of the lofty mountains. The
terror of Ashur my Lord overwhelmed them; they came and submitted to my
yoke; I imposed on them tribute and offerings.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XV</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The countries of Tsaravas and Ammavas, which from the olden time had never
submitted, I swept like heaps of stubble; with their forces in the country
of Aruma I fought, and I defeated them. The ranks of their fighting men I
levelled like grass. I bore away their gods; their movables, their wealth,
and their valuables I carried off. Their cities I burnt with fire, I
destroyed and overthrew, and converted into heaps and mounds. The heavy
yoke of my empire I imposed on them. I attached them to the worship of
Ashur my Lord.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XVI</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I took the countries of Itsua and Daria, which were turbulent and
disobedient. Tribute and offerings I imposed on them. I attached them to
the worship of Ashur.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XVII</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In my triumphant progress over my enemies, my chariots and troops I
assembled; I crossed the lower Zab. The countries of Muraddan and
Tsaradavas, which were near Atsaniu and Atuva, difficult regions, I
captured; their warriors I cut down <emphasis>like weeds</emphasis>. The city of Muraddan,
their capital city, and the regions toward the rising sun, I took
possession of. Their gods, their wealth, and their valuables, one <emphasis>soss</emphasis>
bars of iron, 30 talents of iron, the abundant wealth of the Lords, of
their palaces, and their movables, I carried off. This city I burnt with
fire, I destroyed and overthrew. At this time this iron to the god Vul, my
great Lord and guardian, I dedicated.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XVIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the might and power of Ashur my Lord, I went to the country of Tsugi,
belonging to Gilkhi, which did not acknowledge Ashur my Lord. With 4,000
of their troops, belonging to the countries Khimi, Lukhi, Arirgi, Alamun,
Nuni, and all the far-spread land of the <emphasis>Akhí</emphasis>, in the country of
Khirikhi, a difficult region, which rose up like metal posts, with all
their people I fought <emphasis>on foot</emphasis>. I defeated them; the bodies of their
fighting men on the tops of the mountains I heaped in masses. The
carcasses of their warriors I strewed over the country of Khirikhi like
chaff. I took the entire country of Tsugi. Twenty-five of their gods,
their movables, their wealth, and their valuables I carried off. Many of
their cities I burnt with fire, I destroyed and overthrew. The men of
their armies submitted to my yoke. I had mercy on them. I imposed on them
tribute and offerings. With attachment to the worship of Ashur, my Lord, I
intrusted them.[1]</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: That is, "I caused them to worship Ashur."]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XIX</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At this time 25 of the gods belonging to those countries, subject to my
government, which I had taken, I dedicated for the honor of the temple of
the Queen of glory, the great ancestress of Ashur my Lord, of Anu, and of
Vul, the goddess who is the guardian of all the public temples of my city
of Ashur, and of all the goddesses of my country.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>At this time, in exalted reverence to Ashur, my Lord, by the godlike
support of the heroic "Sun," having in the service of the great gods,
ruled over the four regions imperially; there being found (to me) no equal
in war, and no second in battle, to the countries of the powerful Kings
who dwelt upon the upper ocean and had never made their submission, the
Lord Ashur having urged me, I went. Difficult mountain chains, and distant
(or inaccessible) hills, which none of our Kings had ever previously
reached, tedious paths and unopened roads I traversed. The countries of

countries, the easy parts in my chariots, and the difficult parts in
wagons of iron, I passed through; the thickets of the mountains I cut down;
bridges for the passage of my troops I prepared; I crossed over the
Euphrates; the King of Elammi, the King of Tunubi, the King of Tuhali, the

Vagina, the King of Nazabia, the King of <emphasis>Amalziú</emphasis>, the King of Dayeni, in
all 23 Kings of the countries of Naíri, in their own provinces having
assembled their chariots and troops, they came to fight with me.[1] By
means of my powerful servants I straitened them.[2] I caused the
destruction of their far-spreading troops, as if with the destroying
tempest of Vul. I levelled the ranks of their warriors, both on the tops
of the mountains and on the battlements of the cities, like <emphasis>grass</emphasis>. Two
soss [3] of their chariots I held as a trophy from the midst of the fight;
one soss [4] of the kings of the countries of Naíri, and of those who had
come to their assistance, in my victory as far as the upper ocean I
pursued them; I took their great castles; I plundered their movables,
their wealth and their valuables; their cities I burnt with fire, I
destroyed and overthrew, and converted into heaps and mounds. Droves of
many horses and mules, of calves and of lambs, their property, in
countless numbers I carried off. Many of the kings of the countries of
Naíri fell alive into my hands; to these kings I granted pardon; their
lives I spared; their abundance and wealth I poured out before my Lord,
the sun-god. In reverence to my great gods, to after-times, to the last
day, I condemned them to do homage. The young men, the pride of their
royalty, I gave over to the service of the gods; 1,200 horses and 2,000
cattle I imposed on them as tribute, and I allowed them to remain in their
own countries.</p>

<p>Tseni, the King of Dayani, who was not submissive to Ashur my Lord, his
abundance and wealth I brought it to my city of Ashur. I had mercy on him.
I left him in life to learn the worship of the great gods from my city of
Ashur. I reduced the far-spreading countries of Naíri throughout their
whole extent, and many of their kings I subjected to my yoke.</p>

<p>In the course of this expedition, I went to the city of Milidia, belonging
to the country of Khanni-rabbi, which was independent and did not obey me.
They abstained from engaging in the rude fight with me; they submitted to
my yoke, and I had mercy on them. This city I did not occupy, but I gave
the people over to religious service, and I imposed on them as a token of
their allegiance a fixed tribute of …[1]</p>

<p>In the service of my Lord Ashur, my chariots and warriors I assembled; I

the Aramæans, the enemies of my Lord Ashur. From before Tsukha, as far as
the city of Qarqamis[1] belonging to the country of Khatte,[2] I smote
with <emphasis>one blow</emphasis>. Their fighting men I slew; their movables, their wealth,
and their valuables in countless numbers I carried off. The men of their
armies who fled from before the face of the valiant servants of my Lord
Ashur, crossed over the Euphrates; in boats covered with bitumen skins I
crossed the Euphrates after them; I took six of their cities which were
below the country of Bisri; I burnt them with fire, and I destroyed and
overthrew; and I brought their movables, their wealth, and their valuables
to my city of Ashur.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>My Lord Ashur having urged me on, I took my way to the vast country of
Muzri, lying beyond Elammi, Tala, and Kharutsa; I took the country of
Muzri throughout its whole extent; I subdued their warriors; I burnt their
cities with fire, I destroyed and overthrew; the troops of the country of
Comani hastened to the assistance of the country of Muzri: in the
mountains I fought with them and defeated them. In the metropolis, the
city of Arin, which was under the country of Ayatsa, I besieged them; they
submitted to my yoke; I spared this city; but I imposed on them religious
service and tribute and offerings.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XXVIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At this time the whole country of Comani which was in alliance with the
country of Muzri, all their people assembled and arose to do battle and
make war. By means of my valiant servants I fought with 20,000 of their
numerous troops in the country of Tala, and I defeated them; their mighty
mass broke in pieces; as far as the country of Kharutsa, belonging to
Muzri, I smote them and pursued; the ranks of their troops on the heights
of the mountains I cut down <emphasis>like grass</emphasis>; their carcasses covered the
valleys and the tops of the mountains; their great castles I took, I burnt
with fire, I destroyed, and overthrew into heaps and mounds.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>XXIX</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The city of Khunutsa, their stronghold, I overthrew like a heap of
stubble. With their mighty troops in the city and on the hills I fought
<emphasis>fiercely</emphasis>. I defeated them; their fighting men in the middle of the
forests I scattered like <emphasis>chaff</emphasis>. I cut off their heads as if they were
<emphasis>carrion</emphasis>; their carcasses filled the valleys and (covered) the heights of
the mountains. I captured this city; their gods, their wealth, and their
valuables I carried off, and burnt with fire. Three of their great
castles, which were built of brick, and the entire city I destroyed and
overthrew, and converted into heaps and mounds, and upon the site I laid
down large stones; and I made tablets of copper, and I wrote on them an
account of the countries which I had taken by the help of my Lord Ashur,
and about the taking of this city, and the building of its castle; and
upon it[1] I built a house of brick, and I set up within it these copper
tablets.</p>

<p>In the service of Ashur my Lord, my chariots and warriors I assembled, and
I approached Kapshuna, their capital city; the tribes of Comani would not
engage in battle with me; they submitted to my yoke, and I spared their
lives. The great castle of the city and its brick buildings I trampled
under foot; from its foundations to its roofs I destroyed it and converted
it into heaps and mounds, and a band of 300 fugitive heretics who did not
acknowledge my Lord Ashur, and who were expelled from inside this
<emphasis>castle</emphasis>, I took this band and condemned to the service of the gods, and I
imposed upon the people tribute and offerings in excess of their former
tribute; and the far-spreading country of Comani throughout its whole
extent I reduced under my yoke.</p>

<p>There fell into my hands altogether between the commencement of my reign

them under one government; I placed them under the Magian religion, and I
imposed on them tribute and offerings.</p>

<p>Under the auspices of my guardian deity Hercules, two <emphasis>soss</emphasis> of lions fell

<p>From all the enemies of Ashur, the whole of them, I exacted <emphasis>labor</emphasis>. I
made, and finished the repairs of, the temple of the goddess Astarte, my
lady, and of the temple of Martu, and of Bel, and Il, and of the sacred
buildings and <emphasis>shrines</emphasis> of the gods belonging to my city of Ashur. I
<emphasis>purified</emphasis> their shrines, and set up inside the images of the great gods,
my Lords. The royal palaces of all the great fortified cities throughout
my dominions, which from the olden time our kings had neglected through
long years, had become ruined. I repaired and finished them. The castles
of my country, I filled up their <emphasis>breaches</emphasis>. I founded many new buildings
throughout Assyria, and I opened out irrigation for corn in excess of what
my fathers had done. I carried off the droves of the horses, cattle, and
asses that I obtained, in the service of my Lord Ashur, from the
subjugated countries which I rendered tributary, and the droves of the
wild goats and ibexes, the wild sheep and the wild cattle which Ashur and
Hercules, my guardian gods, incited me to chase in the depths of the
forests, having taken them I drove them off, and I led away their young
ones like the tame young goats. These little <emphasis>wild animals</emphasis>, the delight

<p>At this time the temple of Anu and Vul, the great gods, my Lords, which,
in former times, Shansi-Vul, High-priest of Ashur, son of Ismi Dagan,
High-priest of Ashur, had founded, having lasted for 641 years, it fell
into ruin. Ashur-dapur-Il, King of Assyria, son of Barzan-pala-kura, King
of Assyria, took down this temple and did not rebuild it. For 60 years the
foundations of it were not laid.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>In the beginning of my reign, Anu and Vul, the great gods, my Lords,
guardians of my steps, they invited me to repair this their shrine. So I
made bricks; I levelled the earth, I took its <emphasis>dimensions</emphasis>; I laid down
its foundations upon a mass of strong rock. This place throughout its
whole extent I paved with bricks in <emphasis>set order</emphasis>, 50 feet deep I prepared
the ground, and upon this substructure I laid the lower foundations of the
temple of Anu and Vul. From its foundations to its roofs I built it up,
better than it was before. I also built two lofty cupolas in honor of
their noble godships, and the holy place, a spacious hall, I consecrated
for the convenience of their worshippers, and to accommodate their
votaries, who were numerous as the stars of heaven, and in quantity poured
forth like flights of arrows.[1] I repaired, and built, and completed my
work. Outside the temple I fashioned (everything with the same care) as
inside. The mound of earth (on which it was built) I enlarged like the
firmament of the rising stars, and I beautified the entire building. Its
cupolas I raised up to heaven, and its roofs I built entirely of brick. An
inviolable shrine for their noble godships I laid down near at hand. Anu
and Vul, the great gods, I glorified inside,[2] I set them up on their
honored purity, and the hearts of their noble godships I delighted.</p>

<p>Bit-Khamri, the temple of my Lord Vul, which Shansi-Vul, High-priest of

ruined. I levelled its site, and from its foundation to its roofs I built
it up of brick, I enlarged it beyond its former state, and I adorned it.
Inside of it I sacrificed precious victims to my Lord Vul.</p>

<p>XLVIII</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>At this time I found various sorts of stone[1] in the countries of Nairi

<p>Since a holy place, a noble hall, I have thus consecrated for the use of

their special worship, and have finished it successfully, and have
delighted the hearts of their noble godships, may Anu and Vul preserve me
in power. May they support the men of my Government. May they establish
the authority of my officers. May they bring the rain, the joy of the
year, on the cultivated land and the desert during my time. In war and in
battle may they preserve me victorious. Many foreign countries, turbulent
nations, and hostile Kings I have reduced under my yoke; to my children
and descendants may they keep them in firm allegiance. I will lead my

<p>In after-times, and in the latter days …,[1] if the temple of the great

raise altars and sacrifice victims before my tablets and cylinders, and

<p><strong>THE REVOLT IN HEAVEN</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY H. FOX TALBOT, F.R.S.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This curious narrative is found on a cuneiform tablet in the British
Museum. The original text is published in Plate 42 of Delitzsch's work,
"<emphasis>Assyrische Lesestucke</emphasis>." I gave a translation of it in the "Transactions
of the Society of Biblical Archæology," Vol. IV, pp. 349-362.</p>
<p>This tablet describes the revolt of the gods or angels against their
Creator. It seems to have been preceded by an account of the perfect
harmony which existed in heaven previously. And here I would call to mind
a noble passage in Job, chap, xxxviii, which deserves particular
attention, since it is not derived from the Mosaic narrative but from some
independent source, namely, that when God laid the foundations of the
world, "the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted
for joy." By "the sons of God" in this passage are to be understood the
angels. In the beginning, therefore, according to this sacred author, all
was joy and harmony and loyalty to God. But this state of union and
happiness was not to last. At some unknown time, but before the creation
of man, some of the angels ceased to worship their Creator: thoughts of
pride and ingratitude arose in their hearts, they revolted from God, and
were by his just decree expelled from heaven. These were the angels of
whom it is said in the book of Jude that "they kept not their first
estate, but left their own habitation." [Footnote: Jude 6.] The opinions
of the fathers and of other religious writers on this mysterious subject
it were useless to examine, since they admit that nothing can be certainly
known about it. The opinion that one-third of the heavenly host revolted
from their Creator is founded on Rev. xii. 3, where it is said: "And there
appeared a dragon in heaven, having seven heads … and his tail drew the
third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth. And
there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon,
and the dragon fought and his angels. And prevailed not: neither was their
place found any more in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out—he was
cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him,"</p>
<p>The Revelation of St. John was written in the first century, but some of
the imagery employed may have been far more ancient, and for that reason
more impressive to the religious mind of the age.</p>
<p>The war between Michael and the dragon bears much resemblance to the
combat of Bel and the dragon recounted on a Chaldean tablet. [Footnote:
See G. Smith, p. 100 of his Chaldean Genesis.] And it is not unworthy of
remark that the Chaldean dragon had seven heads, like that spoken of in
the Revelation. [Footnote: See 2 R 19, col. ii. 14, and my Assyrian
Glossary, No. 108.]</p>
<p>At the creation harmony had prevailed in heaven. All the sons of God, says
Job, shouted for joy. What caused the termination of this blissful state?
We are not informed, and it would be in vain to conjecture. But the
Babylonians have preserved to us a remarkable tradition, which is found in
the tablet of page 42, and has not, I believe, been hitherto understood.
It is unlike anything in the Bible or in the sacred histories of other
countries. While the host of heaven were assembled and were all engaged in
singing hymns of praise to the Creator, suddenly some evil spirit gave the
signal of revolt. The hymns ceased in one part of the assembly, which
burst forth into loud curses and imprecations on their Creator. In his
wrath he sounded a loud blast of the trumpet and drove them from his
presence never to return.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>THE REVOLT IN HEAVEN</p>
<p>(The first four lines are broken. They related, no doubt, that a festival
of praise and thanksgiving was being held in heaven, when this rebellion
took place.)</p>
<p>5   The Divine Being spoke three times, the commencement
    of a psalm.
6   The god of holy songs, Lord of religion and worship
7   seated a thousand singers and musicians: and established
    a choral band
8   who to his hymn were to respond in multitudes …
9   With a loud cry of contempt they broke up his holy song
10  spoiling, confusing, confounding, his hymn of praise.
11  The god of the bright crown [1] with a wish to summon his
    adherents
12  sounded a trumpet blast which would wake the dead,
13  which to those rebel angels prohibited return,
14  he stopped their service, and sent them to the gods who
    were his enemies.[2]
15  In their room he created mankind.[3]
16  The first who received life dwelt along with him.
17  May he give them strength, never to neglect his word,
18  following the serpent's voice, whom his hands had made.
19  And may the god of divine speech [4] expel from his five
    thousand [5] that wicked thousand
20  who in the midst of his heavenly son, had shouted evil
    blasphemies!
21  The god Ashur, who had seen the malice of those gods who
    deserted their allegiance
22  to raise a rebellion, refused to go forth with them.</p>
<p>(The remainder of the tablet, nine or ten lines more, is too much broken
for translation.)</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: The Assyrian scribe annotates in the margin that the same god
is meant throughout, under all these different epithets.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: They were in future to serve the powers of evil.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: It will be observed that line 15 says that mankind were
created to fill up the void in creation which the ungrateful rebellion of
the angels had caused. A friend has supplied me with some striking
evidence that the mediæval church also held that opinion, though it was
never elevated to the rank of an authorized doctrine.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: See note 4. This is another epithet.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: The total number of the gods is, I believe, elsewhere given
as 5,000.]</p>

<p><strong>THE LEGEND OF THE TOWER OF BABEL</strong></p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY W. ST. CHAD BOSCAWEN</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This legend is found on a tablet marked K, 3,657, in the British Museum.
The story which the tablet contains appears to be the building of some
great temple tower, apparently by command of a king. The gods are angry at
the work, and so to put an end to it they confuse the speech of the
builders. The tablet is in a very broken condition, only a few lines being
in any way complete.</p>

<p><strong>AN ACCADIAN PENITENTIAL PSALM</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The following psalm for remission of sins is remarkable alike for its
deeply spiritual tone and for its antiquity. As it is written in Accadian,
its composition must be referred to a date anterior to the seventeenth
century B.C., when that language became extinct. An Assyrian interlinear
translation is attached to most of the lines; some, however, are left
untranslated. The tablet is unfortunately broken in the middle, causing a
lacuna in the text. Similarities will be noticed between the language of
the psalm and that of the Psalms of the Old Testament, and one passage
reminds us strongly of the words of Christ in St. Matthew xviii. 22.
Seven, it must be remembered, was a sacred number among the Accadians.
Accadian poetry was characterized by a parallelism of ideas and clauses;
and as this was imitated, both by the Assyrians and by the Jews, the
striking resemblance between the form of Accadian and Hebrew poetry can be
accounted for.</p>
<p>Some of the lines in the middle of the psalm have been previously
translated by Mr. Fox Talbot, in the "Transactions of the Society of
Biblical Archæology," Vol. II, p. 60, and Prof. Schrader in his
"<emphasis>Hollenfahrt der Istar</emphasis>," pp. 90-95.</p>

<p><strong>THE BLACK OBELISK INSCRIPTION OF SHALMANESER II</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This inscription is engraved on an obelisk of black marble, five feet in
height, found by Mr. Layard in the centre of the Mound at Nimroud, and now
in the British Museum. Each of its four sides is divided into five
compartments of sculpture representing the tribute brought to the Assyrian
King by vassal princes, Jehu of Israel being among the number.
Shalmaneser, whose annals and conquests are recorded upon it, was the son
of Assur-natsir-pal, and died in 823 B.C., after a reign of thirty-five
years. A translation of the inscription was one of the first achievements
of Assyrian decipherment, and was made by Sir. H. Rawlinson; and Dr.
Hincks shortly afterward (in 1851) succeeded in reading the name of Jehu
in it. M. Oppert translated the inscription in his "<emphasis>Histoire des Empires
de Chaldée et d'Assyrie</emphasis>," and M. Ménant has given another rendering of it
in his "<emphasis>Annales des Rois d'Assyrie</emphasis>" (1874). A copy of the text will be
found in Layard's "Inscriptions in the Cuneiform Character" (1851).</p>

22   At the beginning of my reign; when on the throne
23   of royalty mightily I had seated myself, the chariots
24   of my host I collected. Into the lowlands[1] of the country
     of 'Sime'si
25   I descended. The city of Aridu, the strong city
26   of Ninni, I took. In my first year
27   the Euphrates in its flood I crossed. To the sea of the

31   the country of Lallar I ascended. An image of my Royalty
     in the midst (of it) I erected.
32   In my second year to the city of Tel-Barsip I approached.

     him up. The Euphrates
34   in its flood I crossed. The city of Dahigu, a choice city
     of the Hittites
35   together with the cities which (were) dependent upon it I
     captured. In my third year Akhuni

     and the city of Tel-Barsip,</p>

     the Kings
40   of the Hittites call the city of Pitru,[1]
41   for myself I took. At my return
42   into the lowlands of the country of Alzi I descended. The

     I crossed. To the country of Zamua
51   of Bit-Ani I went down. The cities of Nigdiara of the
     city of the Idians
52   (and) Nigdima I captured. In my fifth year to the country
     of Kasyari I ascended.
53   The strongholds I captured. Elkhitti of the Serurians (in)
     his city I shut up. His tribute

60   of Damascus, Irkhulina of Hamath, and the Kings
61   of the Hittites and of the sea-coasts to the forces of each
     other
62   trusted, and to make war and battle

65   Their chariots, their war-carriages, their war-material[2] I

106  Kings of the country of Tabalu their wealth I received.
     To conquer
107  the mines of silver, of salt and of stone for sculpture I
     went. In my 23d year
108  the Euphrates I crossed. The city of Uetas, his strong

110  had set out. Their tribute I received. In my 24th year,
     the lower Zab
111  I crossed. The land of Khalimmur I passed through. To

113  of my mighty weapons fled and to save his life
114  ascended (the mountains). The cities of 'Sikhisatakh,
     Bit-Tamul, Bit-Sacci
115  (and) Bit-Sedi, his strong cities, I captured. His fighting
     men I slew.
116  His spoil I carried away. The cities I threw down, dug
     up, (and) with fire burned.
117  The rest of them to the mountains ascended. The peaks
     of the mountains
118  I attacked, I captured. Their fighting men I slew. Their
     spoil (and) their goods
119  I caused to be brought down. From the country of Zimru
     I departed. The tribute of 27 Kings
120  of the country of Par'sua[3] I received. From the country
     of Par'sua I departed. To
121  the strongholds of the country of the Amadai,[4] (and)
     the countries of Arazias (and) Kharkhar I went down.
122  The cities of Cua-cinda, Khazzanabi, Ermul,
123  (and) Cin-ablila with the cities which were dependent
     on them I captured. Their fighting men</p>

     threw down,

     thunderstorm I swept. Exceeding
159  fear over them I cast. In my 30th year when in the city

174  I captured. Their spoil, their plunder to Assyria I
     brought. In my 31st year, the second time, the cyclical-feast
175  of Assur and Rimmon I had inaugurated.[5] At the time
     while I was stopping in the city of Calah, Dayan-Assur

179  forty-six cities of the city of the Muzatsirians I captured.
     Up to the borders of the country of the Armenians
180  I went. Fifty of their cities I threw down, dug up (and)
     burned with fire. To the country of Guzani[6] I went down.

187  which depended upon them I captured. Their fighting-men

188  Exceeding fear of Assur (and) Merodach overwhelmed

<p><strong>INSCRIPTION OF NEBUCHADNEZZAR</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. J.M. RODWELL, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Babylonian inscriptions are by no means so replete with interest as the
Assyrian. The latter embrace the various expeditions in which the Assyrian
monarchs were engaged, and bring us into contact with the names and
locality of rivers, cities, and mountain-ranges, with contemporary princes
in Judea and elsewhere, and abound in details as to domestic habits, civil
usages, and the implements and modes of warfare. But the Babylonian
inscriptions refer mainly to the construction of temples, palaces, and
other public buildings, and at the same time present especial difficulties
in their numerous architectural terms which it is often impossible to
translate with any certainty. They are, however, interesting as records of
the piety and religious feelings of the sovereigns of Babylon, and as
affording numerous topographical notices of that famous city; while the
boastful language of the inscription will often remind the reader of
Nebuchadnezzar's words in Dan. iv. 30: "Is not this great Babylon, that I
have built for the house of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for
the honor of my majesty?" Compare column vii, line 32.</p>
<p>The reign of Nebuchadnezzar extended from B.C. 604 to 561. In B.C. 598 he
laid siege to Jerusalem (2 Kings xxiv.) and made Jehoiachin prisoner, and
in 588 again captured the city, and carried Zedekiah, who had rebelled
against him, captive to Babylon (2 Kings xxv.). Josephus gives an account
of his expeditions against Tyre and Egypt, which are also mentioned with
many details in Ezek. xxvii.-xxix.</p>
<p>The name Nebuchadnezzar, or more accurately Nebuchadrezzar (Jer. xxi. 2,
7, etc.), is derived from the Jewish Scriptures. But in the inscriptions
it reads Nebo-kudurri-ussur, <emphasis>i.e.,</emphasis> "may Nebo protect the crown"; a name
analogous to that of his father Nebo(Nabu)-habal-ussur. ("Nebo protect the
son") and to that of Belshazzar, <emphasis>i.e.,</emphasis> "Bel protect the prince." The
phonetic writing of Nebuchadnezzar is <emphasis>"An-pa-sa-du-sis,"</emphasis> each of which
syllables has been identified through the syllabaries. The word
"<emphasis>kudurri</emphasis>" is probably the [Hebrew: kether] of Esther vi. 8, and the
[Greek: kidaris] of the Greeks. The inscriptions of which a translation
follows was found at Babylon by Sir Harford Jones Bridges, and now forms
part of the India House Collection. It is engraved on a short column of
black basalt, and is divided into ten columns, containing 619 lines.</p>
<p>It may be worth while to remark that in the name given to the prophet
Daniel, Belteshazzar, <emphasis>i.e.,</emphasis> Balat-su-ussur ("preserve thou his life"),
and in Abednego ("servant of Nebo"), we have two of the component parts of
the name of Nebuchadnezzar himself.</p>

<p><strong>COLUMN I</strong></p>

<p>1   Nebuchadnezzar
2   King of Babylon,
3   glorious Prince,
4   worshipper of Marduk,
5   adorer of the lofty one,
6   glorifier of Nabu,
7   the exalted, the possessor of intelligence,
8   who the processions of their divinities
9   hath increased;
10  a worshipper of their Lordships,
11  firm, not to be destroyed;
12  who for the embellishment
13  of Bit-Saggatu and Bit-Zida[1]
14  appointed days hath set apart, and
15  the shrines of Babylon
16  and of Borsippa
17  hath steadily increased;
18  exalted Chief, Lord of peace,
19  embellisher of Bit-Saggatu and Bit-Zida,
20  the valiant son
21  of Nabopolassar
22  King of Babylon am I.</p>
<p>23  When he, the Lord god my maker made me,
24  the god Merodach, he deposited
25  my germ in my mother's (womb):
26  then being conceived
27  I was made.
28  Under the inspection of Assur my judge
29  the processions of the god I enlarged,
30  (namely) of Merodach great Lord, the god my maker.
31  His skilful works
32  highly have I glorified;
33  and of Nebo his eldest son
34  exalter of My Royalty
35  the processions (in honor of)[2] his exalted deity
36  I firmly established.
37  With all my heart firmly
38  (in) worship of their deities I uprose
39  in reverence for Nebo their Lord.</p>
<p>40  Whereas Merodach, great Lord,
41  the head of My ancient Royalty,
42  hath empowered me over multitudes of men,
43  and (whereas) Nebo bestower of thrones in heaven and
    earth,
44  for the sustentation of men,
45  a sceptre of righteousness
46  hath caused my hand to hold;
47  now I, that sacred way
48  for the resting-place of their divinities,
49  for a memorial of all their names,
50  as a worshipper of Nebo, Yav and Istar,
51  for Merodach my Lord I strengthened.
52  Its threshold I firmly laid, and
53  my devotion of heart he accepted, and
54  him did I proclaim
55  … Lord of all beings, and[3]
56  as Prince of the lofty house, and
57  thou, (O Nebuchadnezzar) hast proclaimed the name of
    him
58  who has been beneficent unto thee.
59  His name, (O god,) thou wilt preserve,
60  the path of righteousness thou hast prescribed to him.
61  I, a Prince, and thy worshipper
62  am the work of thy hand;
63  thou hast created me, and[4]
64  the empire over multitudes of men
65  thou hast assigned me,
66  according to thy favor, O Lord,
67  which thou hast accorded
68  to them all.[5]
69  May thy lofty Lordship be exalted!
70  in the worship of thy divinity
71  may it subsist! in my heart
72  may it continue, and my life which to thee is devoted</p>

<p>2   He, the Chief, the honorable,
3   the Prince of the gods, the great Merodach,
4   my gracious Lord, heard
5   and received my prayer;
6   he favored it, and by his exalted power,
7   reverence for his deity
8   placed he in my heart:
9   to bear his tabernacle
10  he hath made my heart firm,
11  with reverence for thy power,

18  in a spot exposed to winds,
19  in a place whose pavements had been broken,
20  low, dried up,
21  a rugged way,
22  a difficult path,
23  I extended.
24  The disobedient I stirred up,
25  and I collected the poor and
26  gave full directions (for the work) and
27  in numbers I supported them.
28  Wares and ornaments

30  silver, molten gold, precious stones,
31  metal, <emphasis>umritgana</emphasis> and cedar woods,

40  for Bit-Saggatu
41  the temple of his power,
42  ornaments for Dakan[2]
43  Bit-Kua, the shrine
44  of Merodach, Lord of the house of the gods,

46  and its seats
47  with splendid gold,
48  as for royalty and deity,
49  with lapis lazuli and alabaster blocks[4]
50  I carefully covered them over;
51  a gate of passage, the gate Beautiful,[5]
52  and the gate of Bit-Zida and Bit-Saggatu
53  I caused to be made brilliant as the sun.

<p><strong>ACCADIAN POEM ON THE SEVEN EVIL SPIRITS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The following poem is one of the numerous bilingual texts, written in the
original Accadian with an interlinear Assyrian translation, which have
been brought from the library of Assur-bani-pal, at Kouyunjik. The seven
evil spirits who are mentioned in it are elsewhere described as the seven
storm-clouds or winds whose leader seems to have been the dragon Tiamat
("the deep") defeated by Bel-Merodach in the war of the gods. It was these
seven storm-spirits who were supposed to attack the moon when it was
eclipsed, as described in an Accadian poem translated by Mr. Fox Talbot in
a previous volume of "Records of the Past." Here they are regarded as the
allies of the incubus or nightmare. We may compare them with the Maruts or
storm-gods of the Rig-Veda (see Max Müller, "Rig-Veda-Sanhita: the Sacred
Hymns of the Brahmans translated and explained," Vol. I). The author of
the present poem seems to have been a native of the Babylonian city of
Eridu, and his horizon was bounded by the mountains of Susiania, over
whose summits the storms raged from time to time. A fragment of another
poem relating to Eridu is appended, which seems to celebrate a temple
similar to that recorded by Maimonides in which the Babylonian gods
gathered round the image of the sun-god to lament the death of Tammuz.</p>
<p>A copy of the cuneiform text will be found in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions
of Western Asia," Vol. IV, pl. 15. M. Fr. Lenormant has translated a
portion of it in "<emphasis>La Magie chez les Chaldéens"</emphasis> pp. 26, 27.</p>

10  O Fire-god, those seven how were they born, how grew
    they up?
11  Those seven in the mountain of the sunset were born.
12  Those seven in the mountain of the sunrise grew up.
13  In the hollows of the earth have they their dwelling.
14  On the high-places of the earth are they proclaimed.
15  As for them in heaven and earth immense (is) their habitation.
16  Among the gods their couch they have not.
17  Their name in heaven (and) earth exists not.
18  Seven they are: in the mountain of the sunset do they rise.
19  Seven they are: in the mountain of the sunrise did they set.
20  Into the hollows of the earth do they penetrate.[5]
21  On the high places of the earth did they ascend.
22  As for them, goods they have not, in heaven and earth they
    are not known.[6]

    unto thee.[8]
24  Of those baleful seven, as many as he sets before thee,
    their might may he give thee,
25  according to the command of his blessed mouth, (he who
    is) the supreme judge of Anu.
26  The Fire-god unto Merodach draws near, and this word
    he saith unto thee.
27  In the pavilion, the resting-place of might, this word he
    hears, and
28  to his father Hea[9] to his house he descends, and speaks:
29  O my father, the Fire-god unto the rising of the sun has
    penetrated, and these secret words has uttered.
30  Learning the story of those seven, their places grant thou
    to another.
31  Enlarge the ears, O son of Eridu.[10]
32  Hea his son Merodach answered:
33  My son, those seven dwell in earth;
34  those seven from the earth have issued.</p>

<p>For the sake of completeness a charm for averting the attack of the seven

<p><strong>CHALDEAN HYMNS TO THE SUN</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY FRANÇOIS LENORMANT</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The sun-god, called in the Accadian <emphasis>Utu</emphasis> and <emphasis>Parra</emphasis> (the latter is of
less frequent occurrence), and in the Semitic Assyrian <emphasis>Samas</emphasis>, held a
less important rank in the divine hierarchy of the Chaldaic-Babylonian
pantheon, afterward adopted by the Assyrians, than the moon-god (in the
Accadian <emphasis>Aku, Enizuna</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Huru-kî;</emphasis> in the Assyrian <emphasis>Sin</emphasis>), who was
even sometimes said to be his father. His principal and most common title
was "Judge of Heaven and Earth," in the Accadian <emphasis>dikud ana kîa</emphasis>, in the
Assyrian <emphasis>dainu sa same u irtsiti</emphasis>. The most important sanctuaries of the
deity were at Larsam, in southern Chaldsea, and Sippara, in the north of
Babylonia.</p>
<p>Some few fragments of liturgical or magical hymns addressed to Shamas have
come down to us. These are five in number, and I give a translation of
them here. They have all been studied previously by other Assyriologists,
but I think the present interpretation of them is superior to any which
has as yet been furnished.</p>
<p>The following are the chief bibliographical data concerning them:</p>
<p>I. The primitive Accadian text, accompanied by an interlinear Assyrian
version published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia," Vol.
IV, pl. 20, No. 2. I put forth a first attempt at a translation in my
"<emphasis>Magie chez les Chaldéens"</emphasis> (p. 165), and since then M. Friedrich
Delitzsch has given a much better explanation of it ("<emphasis>G. Smith's
Chaldäische Genesis,"</emphasis> p. 284). Of this hymn we possess only the first
five lines.</p>
<p>II. The primitive Accadian text, with an interlinear Assyrian version, is
published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia," Vol. IV, pl.
19, No. 2. M. Delitzsch has given a German translation of it in "<emphasis>G.
Smith's Chaldäische Genesis</emphasis>" p. 284, and a revised one in English has
just appeared in Prof. Sayce's "Lectures upon Babylonian Literature," p.
43.</p>
<p>III. A similar sacred text, published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of
Western Asia," Vol. IV, pl. 28, No. I, in which the indications as to the
obverse and reverse of the tablet are incorrect and ought to be altered.
The two fragments left to us, separated by a gap, the extent of which it
is at present impossible to estimate, belong to an incantatory hymn
destined to effect the cure of the king's disease. Interpretations have
been attempted in my "Premières Civilisations" (Vol. II, p. 165 <emphasis>et
seq</emphasis>.), and in the appendices added by M. Friedrich Delitzsch to his
German translation of G. Smith's work, already cited.</p>
<p>IV. The primitive Accadian text with an interlinear Assyrian version,
published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia," Vol. IV, pi.
17, col. I. This hymn, like the preceding one, is intended to be recited
by the priest of magic in order to cure the invalid king. I gave a very
imperfect translation of it in my "<emphasis>Magie chez les Chaldéens</emphasis>" (p. 166).</p>
<p>V. We possess only the Semitic Assyrian version of this text; it was
published in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia," Vol. IV, pl.
17, col. 2. As yet, no one has produced a complete translation of this
hymn; but a few passages have been quoted by M. Friedrich Delitzsch ("<emphasis>G.
Smith's Chaldäische Genesis</emphasis>" p. 284) and myself ("<emphasis>La Magie chez les
Chaldéens</emphasis>" p. 164, and pp. 179, 180, of the English edition, 1877).</p>
<p>I refer the reader to the various publications above mentioned for a
convincing proof of the entirely revised character of the translations
here submitted to him, and I think he will grant that I have made some
progress in this branch of knowledge, since my first attempts many years
ago.</p>

<p><strong>TWO ACCADIAN HYMNS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY REV. A.H. SAYCE, M.A.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The two following hymns, both of which are unfortunately mutilated, are
interesting from their subject-matter. The first is addressed to the
sun-god Tammuz, the husband of Istar, slain by the boar's tusk of winter,
and sought by the goddess in the underground world. It is this visit which
is described in the mythological poem known as the "Descent of Istar into
Hades" ("Records of the Past," Vol. I, p. 143). The myth of Tammuz and
Istar passed, through the Phoenicians, to the Greeks, among whom Adonis
and Aphrodite represent the personages of the ancient Accadian legend.
Tammuz is referred to in Ezek. viii. 14. (See "Records of the Past," Vol.
IX, p. 147.) The second hymn treats of the world-mountain, the Atlas of
the Greeks, which supports the heaven with its stars, and is rooted in
Hades. Under its other name, "Kharsak-kurra," or "Mountain of the East,"
it was identified with the present Mount Elwend, and was regarded as the
spot where the ark had rested, and where the gods had their seat. A
reference is made to it in Isa. xiv. 13. Both hymns illustrate the imagery
and metaphor out of which grew the mythology of primeval Babylonia, and
offer curious parallels to the Aryan hymns of the Rig-Veda. The cuneiform
texts are lithographed in the "Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia,"
Vol. IV, 27, I, 2.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>The following is a selection from an interesting collection of Accadian
songs and proverbs, gjven in a mutilated reading-book of the ancient
language which was compiled for the use of Assyrian (or rather Semitic
Babylonian) students. These sentences were drawn up at a time when it was
necessary for the scribes to be familiar with the old language of Accad,
and to be able to translate it into Assyrian, and hence these phrases are
of very great philological value, since they indicate often analogous
words and various verbal forms. The Assyrian translation and the Accadian
texts are arranged in parallel columns. Some of the proverbs must be taken
from an agricultural treatise of the same nature as the "Works and Days"
of Hesiod. Copies of the texts will be found in the "Cuneiform
Inscriptions of Western Asia," Vol. II, 15, 16.</p>

<p>1   Door and bolt are made fast.

3   The cut beam he strikes: the strong beam he shapes.
4   The resting-place of the field which (is) in the house he
    will establish.
5   Within the court of the house he feels himself small.
6   A heap of witnesses[2] as his foundation he has made strong.
7   Once and twice he has made gains;[3] yet he is not content.
8   By himself he dug and wrought.[4]
9   For silver his resting-place he shall buy.
10  On his heap of bricks a building he builds not, a beam he
    set not up.
11  A house like his own house one man to another consigns.
12  If the house he contracts for he does not complete, 10
    shekels of silver he pays.
13  The joists of his wall he plasters.
14  In the month Marchesvan,[5] the 30th day (let him choose)
    for removal.
15  (Let him choose it, too,) for the burning of weeds.
16  The tenant of the farm two-thirds of the produce on his
    own head to the master of the orchard pays out.</p>

the versions have been revised, in some essential points, for the "Records

the exact representation of the sense of these documents; but on account
of the unusual difficulty of these texts, the reader may easily be
convinced that for a long time yet, and particularly in details of minor
importance, there will remain room enough for a conscientious improvement

<p>This document, engraved on a small broken slab of basalt, is dated from
the first year of the reign of Marduk-idin-akhe. It was discovered long
ago in the small mound of Za'aleh, on the left bank of the Euphrates, a
few miles northwest of Babylon. The text forms two columns of cursive
Babylonian characters; the first column is extremely damaged. Though
defaced, this contract offers some interest by its differing from other
documents of the aforesaid reign. It has been published in the first
volume of the collection of the British Museum ("W.A.I.," pl. 66), and

<p>THE PARIS MICHAUX STONE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This monument is so called from the name of the traveller by whom it was
brought over to France in 1800. It was discovered near the Tigris, not far
from the ruins of the ancient city of Ctesiphon. It is an ovoid basalt
stone of seventeen inches in height, by twenty-four in circumference. The
upper part is decorated with symbolical figures spread over nearly
one-third of the monument; one of the sides is divided in two parts. At
the top the moon crescent and the sun are represented; in a somewhat lower
place there are four altars; two on the right support tiaras; the other
two are adorned with two symbolical figures. In the middle a winged goat
kneeling; the lower part of the animal is hidden by the image of another
altar. The second part contains two altars; one of them bears a sort of
arrow-head which for a long time has been taken for the symbol of the
Cuneiform writing, because it resembles the element of these characters,
On the other part there is a triangular symbol, then, between both altars,
two kneeling monsters; only the fore part of their body is visible. On the
left behind the altar there is to be seen a symbolical figure preceding a
downward pointed arrow. On the back side of the monument there is a
scorpion, a bird roosting. On the ground there is a bird, on the head of
which is to be seen an unknown symbol composed of two other monsters, one
bears a bird's head, and the other has a hideous horned face; the rest of
the body is wrapped up in a sort of sheath; opposite to which a dog
kneeling. The top of the stone is bordered with an immense snake; its tail
extends into the very inscriptions, its head touches the head of the dog.
On each side of the monument in its lower part, there are two columns of
cuneiform texts, which contain altogether ninety-five lines.</p>
<p>This monument is now kept since 1801 in the "<emphasis>Cabinet des Médailles</emphasis>" at
Paris (No. 702). Since that epoch it has always attracted the attention of
scholars; it was published by M. Millin in 1802, "<emphasis>Monuments inédits</emphasis>" t.
I, pl. viii, ix. Münter first attempted to explain the symbolical figures
(<emphasis>"Religion der Babylonier,"</emphasis> p. 102, pl. III). Sir Henry Rawlinson has
also published the inscription again, in "W.A.I.," Vol. I, p. 70. The
sense of this text has been fixed for the first time, in 1856, by M.
Oppert's translation in the "<emphasis>Bulletin Archéologique de l'Athénéum
Français</emphasis>" After this translation, Mr. Fox Talbot gave one in 1861, in the
"Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society," Vol. XVIII, p. 54.</p>

<p>COLUMN I</p>

<p>20 hin of corn is the quantity for seeding an <emphasis>arura</emphasis>.[1] The field is
situated near the town of Kar-Nabu, on the bank of the river Mekaldan,
depending of the property of Kilnamandu.</p>
<p>The field is measured as follows:[2] Three stades in length toward the
East, in the direction of the town of Bagdad; three stades in length
toward the West, adjoining the house of Tunamissah; 1 stade 50 fathoms[3]
in breadth toward the North, adjoining the property of Kilnamandu; 1 stade
50 fathoms up in the South, adjoining the property of Kilnamandu.</p>
<p>Sirusur, son of Kilnamandu, gave it for all future days to Dur-Sarginaiti,
his daughter, the bride[4] of Tab-asap-Marduk, son of Ina-e-saggatu-irbu
(the pretended), who wrote this; and Tab-asap-Marduk, son of
Ina-e-saggatu-irbu, who wrote this in order to perpetuate without
interruption the memory of this gift, and commemorated on this stone the
will of the great gods and the god Serah.</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: Or the great U, namely, of the field in question.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: Dr. Oppert's first translation of this passage, which is to
be found in almost all documents of this kind, has been corrected in
"L'Etalon des mesures assyriennes," p. 42. The field of Kilnamandu was a
rectangle of 1-5/6 stades in breadth and 3 stades long, viz., 5-1/2 square
stades, amounting to 19.64 hectares, or 48-1/2 English acres. The Stone of
Micheux is the only one which affords a valuation of the land.</p>
<p>The arura (great U) is valued at 88 hectares, 207 acres in the Babylonian
system; a hin is almost 3 litres, or 5 pints and a quarter; 20 hins,
therefore, are somewhat more than 13 gallons. The fertility of the
Babylonian soil was renowned in antiquity. See Herodotus i. 193.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: A fathom, 10-1/3 feet, is the sixtieth part of a stade, 620
feet.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: This word is explained in a syllabary copied by Dr. Oppert in
1855, but which has never been published. The three signs of the ideogram
("Bit-gigunu-a") are rendered by "kallatu" ("a bride"), and this very
important statement put the translator on the track of the right
interpretation.]</p>

the boundary-stone, or will vindicate it: whether he consecrate this field
to a god, or earn it for his superior, or claim it for himself, or change
the extent, the surface, or the limits, that he reaps new harvests (crops);
or who will say of the field with its measures, "There is no granter;"
whether he call forth malediction and hostility on the tablets; or
establish on it anyone other who change these curses, in swearing: "The
head is not the head;" and in asserting: There is no evil eye;[1]
whosoever will carry elsewhere those tablets; or will throw them into the
water; will bury them in the earth; will hide them under stones; will burn
them with fire, will alter what is written on them, will confine them into
a place where they might not be seen; that man shall be cursed:</p>

which cannot be broken.</p>
<p>May Samas, the great Judge of heaven and earth, judge his unpunished
misdeeds, and surprise him in flagrant deeds.</p>
<p>May Sin, the brilliant (<emphasis>Nannar</emphasis>), who dwells in the sacred heavens,

that wander in the outsides of the town.</p>
<p>May Istar, the Queen of heaven and earth, carry him off, and deliver him
for avenge to the god and the king.</p>
<p>May Ninip, son of the zenith, son of El the sublime, take away his lands,
funds, and limits.</p>

with irrevocable malediction, and scatter his race even to the last days.</p>

<p>(This monument is equally engraved on a black basalt stone; it offers the
same arrangement as the stone of Michaux. The analogous documents show
that numerous inaccuracies have been committed.</p>
<p>In the upper part there occur the same altars, tiaras, birds, as well as
the above-mentioned goat, dog, scorpion, and snake. The surface of the
basso-relievo is also covered with Cuneiform writing.</p>
<p>The inscriptions are arranged in four columns, and take both sides of the
monument. The first column originally finished at the 30th line; it seems
to have been completed by four lines, which contain one of the essential
articles of the contract, but which evidently are not in their right
place, and had been actually forgotten in the original engraving.</p>
<p>On the margins and the bassso-relievo many additions and repetitions are
to be read, which also prove the engraver's carelessness or
precipitation.)</p>

land of Zunire,[3] on the bank of the river Zirzirri, belonging to the
house of Ada.</p>
<p>Marduk-idin-akhe, King of Babylon, has thus sentenced according to the
laws of the country of Assur. Bin-zir-basa, his Minister, has favored
Marduk-ilusu, son of Ina-e-saggatu-irbu,[4] who has written this to the
King of Babylon: I say, He has loaded me with favors, and I proclaim that
this rating has been made according to the epha[5] of the King of Babylon.</p>
<p>20 hin of corn are sufficient to seed an <emphasis>arura</emphasis>. Bin-zir-basa, the

lands) has thus measured it for the time to come.</p>

<p>CONTRACT OF HANKAS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(The fourth monument of the reign of Marduk-idin-akhe is a black basalt
stone of nearly the same size and arrangement as the preceding. At the top
we also see analogous symbols disposed in a similar way. The inscription
has but two colums, and occupies but one side of the monument; on the
other, the image of the King is engraved, and near the garment of the
King, represented by the basso-relievo, the three lines of the beginning
are repeated at the end of the document.)</p>
<p>By this table, the author of the everlasting limits has forever

give it, will earn the harvest of the land, will say,[11] "These fields
are not granted as gifts by the King"; whether he pronounce against them
the holy malediction or he swears by these words, "The head is not the
head"; and establish anyone therein, in saying, "There is no eye"; or who
will carry away this tablet, or will throw it into the river, or will
break it into pieces, or will bury it under a heap of stones, or will burn
it by fire, or will bury it in the earth, or will hide it in a dark place,

maledictions which are not (retracted).</p>

into darkness the light of the day.</p>

pains,) so that he runs about like a dog, in the ways of his town.</p>

end, entangle his weapons with bonds which cannot be broken.</p>

<p><strong>GREAT INSCRIPTION IN THE PALACE OF KHORSABAD</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>TRANSLATED BY DR. JULIUS OPPERT</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The document of which I publish a translation has been copied with
admirable precision by M. Botta in his "<emphasis>Monuments de Ninive</emphasis>" There are
four specimens of this same text in the Assyrian palace, which bear the
title of Inscriptions of the Halls, Nos. iv, vii, viii, and x.</p>
<p>There is another historical document in the palace of Khorsabad containing
more minute particulars, and classed in a chronological order, which I
translated in my "<emphasis>Dur-Sar-kayan</emphasis>," 1870, and in the "Records of the
Past," Vol. VII.</p>
<p>The several copies of this document have been united in one sole text in a
work which I published in common with M. Ménant in the "<emphasis>Journal
Asiatique</emphasis>," 1863.</p>
<p>I published my translation of the "Great Inscriptions of Khorsabad," in
the "<emphasis>Annales de Philosophie Chrétienne</emphasis>," July and August, 1862, tom. V
(New Series), p. 62; then in my "<emphasis>Inscriptions des Sargonides</emphasis>," p. 20
(1862). The same text was inserted in the work which I edited in communion
with my friend M. Joachim Ménant, entitled "<emphasis>La Grande Inscription des
Salles de Khorsabad</emphasis>," "<emphasis>Journal Asiatique</emphasis>," 1863. Some passages have
been since corrected by me in my "<emphasis>Dur-Sarkayan</emphasis>," Paris, 1870, in the
great work of M. Victor Place, and these corrections have been totally
admitted by M. Ménant in a translation which he has given in his book,
"<emphasis>Annales des Rois d'Assyrie</emphasis>," Paris, 1874, p. 180. As the reader may
easily convince himself in collating it with my previous attempts, this
present translation is now amended according to the exigencies of the
progressing science of Assyriology, as it is now understood.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>GREAT INSCRIPTION OF THE PALACE OF KHORSABAD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1   Palace of Sargon, the great King, the powerful King,
    King of the legions, King of Assyria, Viceroy of the gods
    at Babylon, King of the Sumers and of the Accads, favorite
    of the great gods.</p>
<p>2   The gods Assur, Nebo, and Merodach have conferred on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    me the royalty of the nations, and they have propagated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    the memory of my fortunate name to the ends of the earth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have followed the reformed precepts of Sippara, Nipur,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Babylon, and Borsippa; I have amended the imperfections</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    which the men of all laws had admitted.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>3   I have reunited the dominions of Kalu, Ur, Orchoé, Erikhi,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Larsa,[1] Kullab, Kisik, the dwelling-place of the god Laguda;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have subdued their inhabitants. As to the laws</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    of Sumer[2] and of the town of Harran, which had fallen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    into desuetude from the most ancient times, I have restored</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    to fresh vigor their forgotten customs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>4   The great gods have made me happy by the constancy of
    their affection, they have granted me the exercise of my
    sovereignty over all kings; they have re-established obedience
    upon them all. From the day of my accession there
    existed no princes who were my masters; I have not, in
    combats or battles, seen my victor. I have crushed the
    territories of the rebels like straws, and I have struck them
    with the plagues of the four elements. I have opened innumerable
    deep and very extensive forests, I have levelled
    their inequalities. I have traversed winding and thick
    valleys, which were impenetrable, like a needle, and I
    passed in digging tanks dug on my way.</p>
<p>5   By the grace and power of the great gods, my Masters, I
    have flung my arms; by my force I have defeated my enemies.
    I have ruled from Iatnan,[3] which is in the middle
    of the sea of the setting sun, to the frontiers of Egypt and
    of the country of the Moschians, over vast Phoenicia, the
    whole of Syria, the whole of <emphasis>guti muski</emphasis>[4] of distant Media,
    near the country of Bikni, to the country of Ellip, from Ras
    which borders upon Elam, to the banks of the Tigris, to
    the tribes of Itu, Rubu, Haril, Kaldud, Hauran, Ubul,
    Ruhua, of the Litaï who dwell on the borders of the Surappi
    and the Ukne, Gambul, Khindar, and Pukud.[5] I have
    reigned over the <emphasis>suti</emphasis> hunters who are in the territory of
    Iatbur, in whatever it was as far as the towns of Samhun,
    Bab-Dur, Dur-Tilit, Khilikh, Pillat, Dunni-Samas, Bubi,
    Tell-Khumba, which are in the dependency of Elam,[6] and
    Kar-duniyas[7] Upper and Lower, of the countries of Bit-Amukkan,
    Bit-Dakkur, Bit-Silan, Bit-Sa'alla, which together
    form Chaldea in its totality, over the country of Bit-Iakin,
    which is on the sea-shore, as far as the frontier of
    Dilmun. I have received their tributes, I have established
    my Lieutenants over them as Governors, and I have reduced
    them under my suzerainty.</p>
<p>6   This is what I did from the beginning of my reign to my
    fifteenth year of reign:
    I defeated Khumbanigas, King of Elam, in the plains of
    Kalu.</p>
<p>7   I besieged and occupied the town of Samaria, and took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    27,280 of its inhabitants captive. I took from them 50</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    chariots, but left them the rest of their belongings. I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    placed my Lieutenants over them; I renewed the obligation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    imposed upon them by one of the Kings who preceded</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    me.[8]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>8   Hanun, King of Gaza, and Sebech, Sultan[9] of Egypt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    allied themselves at Rapih[10] to oppose me, and fight against</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    me; they came before me, I put them to flight. Sebech</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    yielded before my cohorts, he fled, and no one has ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    seen any trace of him since. I took with my own hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hanun, King of Gaza.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>9   I imposed a tribute on Pharaoh, King of Egypt; Samsie,
    Queen of Arabia; It-amar, the Sabean, of gold, sweet smelling
    herbs of the land, horses, and camels.</p>
<p>10  Kiakku of Sinukhta had despised the god Assur, and refused
    submission to him. I took him prisoner, and seized
    his 30 chariots and 7,350 of his soldiers. I gave Sinuhta,
    the town of his royalty, to Matti from the country of Tuna,
    I added some horses and asses to the former tribute and
    appointed Matti as Governor.</p>
<p>11  Amris of Tabal, had been placed upon the throne of Khulli
    his father; I gave to him a daughter and I gave him Cilicia[10]
    which had never submitted to his ancestors. But he did
    not keep the treaty and sent his ambassador to Urzaha,
    King of Armenia, and to Mita, King of the Moschians,
    who had seized my provinces. I transported Amris to
    Assyria, with his belongings, the members of his ancestors'
    families, and the magnates of the country, as well as 100
    chariots; I established some Assyrians, devoted to my government,
    in their places. I appointed my Lieutenant Governor
    over them, and commanded tributes to be levied
    upon them.</p>
<p>12  Jaubid of Hamath, a smith,[12] was not the legitimate master
    of the throne, he was an infidel and an impious man, and
    he had coveted the royalty of Hamath. He incited the
    towns of Arpad, Simyra, Damascus, and Samaria to rise
    against me, took his precautions with each of them, and
    prepared for battle. I counted all the troops of the god
    Assur; in the town of Karkar which had declared itself
    for the rebel, I besieged him and his warriors, I occupied
    Karkar and reduced it to ashes. I took him, himself, and
    had him flayed, and I killed the chief of the rioters in each
    town, and reduced them to a heap of ruins. I recruited
    my forces with 200 chariots and 600 horsemen from among
    the inhabitants of the country of Hamath and added them
    to my empire.</p>
<p>13  Whilst Iranzu of Van[13] lived, he was subservient and devoted
    to my rule, but fate removed him. His subjects
    placed his son Aza on the throne. Urzaha the Armenian
    intrigued with the people of Mount Mildis, Zikirta, Misiandi,
    with the nobles of Van, and enticed them to rebellion;
    they threw the body of their Master Aza on the top of the
    mountains. Ullusun of Van, his brother, whom they had
    placed on his father's throne, did homage to Urzaha, and
    gave him 22 fortresses with their garrisons. In the anger
    of my heart I counted all the armies of the god Assur, I
    watched like a lion in ambush and advanced to attack these
    countries. Ullusun of Van saw my expedition approaching,
    he set out with his troops and took up a strong position
    in the ravines of the high mountains. I occupied Izirti the
    town of his royalty, and the towns of Izibia and Armit, his
    formidable fortresses, I reduced them to ashes. I killed
    all that belonged to Urzaha the Armenian, in these high
    mountains. I took with my own hand 250 royal members
    of his family. I occupied 55 royal towns of which 8 were
    ordinary towns and 11 impregnable fortresses. I reduced
    them to ashes. I incorporated the 22 strong towns, that
    Ullusun of Van had delivered to him with Assyria. I occupied
    8 strong cities of the country of Tuaya and the districts
    of Tilusina of Andia; 4,200 men, with their belongings,
    were carried away into slavery.</p>
<p>14  Mitatti, of Zikirta, had secured himself against my arms;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    he and the men of his country had fled into the forests;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    no trace of them was to be seen. I reduced Parda, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    town of his royalty to ashes; I occupied twenty-three great</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    towns in the environs, and I spoiled them. The cities of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Suandakhul and Zurzukka, of the country of Van, took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    the part of Mitatti; I occupied and pillaged them. Then I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    took Bagadatti of the Mount Mildis, and I had him flayed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I banished Dayaukku and his suite to Hamath, and I made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    them dwell there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>15  Then Ullusun heard in his high mountains of my glorious
    exploits: he departed in haste like a bird, and kissed my
    feet; I pardoned his innumerable misdeeds, and I blotted
    out his iniquities. I granted pardon to him; I replaced
    him upon the throne of his royalty. I gave him the two
    fortresses and the 22 great towns that I had taken away
    from Urzaha and Mitatti. I endeavored to restore peace
    to his country. I made the image of my Majesty: I wrote
    on it the glory of the god Assur, my Master, I erected many
    fac-similes of it in Izirti, the town of his royalty.</p>
<p>16  I imposed a tribute of horses, oxen, and lambs upon Ianzu,
    King of the river country, in Hupuskia, the town of his
    power.</p>
<p>17  Assurlih, of Kar-Alla, Itti, of Allapur, had sinned against
    Assur and despised his power. I had Assurlih flayed. I
    banished the men of Kar-Alla, whoever they were, and Itti,
    with his suite, I placed them in Hamath.</p>
<p>18  I took the inhabitants of the towns of Sukkia, Bala,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ahitikna, Pappa,[14] Lallukni away from their homes; I made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    them dwell at Damascus in Syria.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>19  I occupied the 6 towns of the country of Niksamma, I took</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    with my own hand Nirisar, Governor of the town of Surgadia;</p>

<p>

    I added these towns to the satrapy of Parsuas.[15]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>20  Bel-sar-usur[16] was King of the town of Kisisim; I had him
    transported to Assyria with all that he possessed, his treasure,
    the contents of his palace; I put my Lieutenant in as
    Governor of the town, to which I gave the name of Kar-Marduk.
    I had an image made of my Majesty and erected
    it in the middle of the town. I occupied 6 towns in the
    neighborhood and I added them to his government.</p>
<p>21  I attacked and conquered Kibaba, Prefect of the town of
    Kharkhar, I took him and the inhabitants of his country
    captive, I rebuilt this city and made the inhabitants of the
    provinces, that my arm had conquered, live there. I placed
    my Lieutenant as Governor over them. I named the town
    Kar-Sarkin; I established the worship of the god Assur,
    my Master, there. I erected an image of my Royal self.
    I occupied 6 towns in the environs, and added them to his
    government.</p>
<p>22  I besieged and took the towns of Tel-Akhi-tub, Khindau,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Bagai, and Anzaria; I transported the inhabitants of them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    to Assyria. I rebuilt them; I gave them the names of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Kar-Nabu, Kar-Sin, Kar-Ben, Kar-Istar.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>23  To maintain my position in Media, I have erected fortifications</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    in the neighborhood of Kar-Sarkin. I occupied</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    34 towns in Media and annexed them to Assyria and I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    levied annual tributes of horses upon them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>24  I besieged and took the town of Eristana, and the surrounding</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    towns in the country of Bait-Ili; I carried away the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    spoil.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>25  The countries of Agag[17] and Ambanda,[18] in Media, opposite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    the Arabs of the East, had refused their tributes, I destroyed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    them, laid them waste, and burnt them by fire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>26  Dalta of Ellip was subject to me, and devoted to the worship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    of Assur; 5 of his towns revolted and no longer recognized</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    his dominion. I came to his aid, I besieged and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    occupied these towns, I carried the men and their goods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    away into Assyria with numberless horses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>27  Urzana, of the town of Musasir, had attached himself to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Urzaha the Armenian, and had refused me his allegiance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With the multitude of my army, I covered the city of Musasir</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    as if it were with ravens, and he to save his life, fled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    alone into the mountains.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>28  I entered as a Ruler into Musasir. I seized as spoil Urzana's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    wife, sons and daughters, his money, his treasures, all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    the stores of his palace whatever they were, with 20,100</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    men and all that they possessed, the gods Haldia and Bagabarta,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    his gods, and their holy vessels in great numbers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>29  Urzaha, King of Armenia, heard of the defeat of Musasir
    and the carrying away of the god Haldia[19] his god, he cut
    off his life by his own hands with a dagger of his girdle.
    I held a severe judgment over the whole of Armenia. I
    spread over the men, who inhabit this country, mourning
    and lamentation.</p>
<p>30  Tarhunazi, of the town of Melid, sought for revenge. He
    sinned against the laws of the great gods, and refused his
    submission. In the anger of my heart, I crushed like
    briars Melid, which was the town of his kingdom, and the
    neighboring towns. I made him, his wife, sons and daughters,
    the slaves of his palace whoever they were, with 5,000
    warriors, leave Tel-Garimmi; I treated them all as booty.
    I rebuilt Tel-Garimmi; I had it entirely occupied by some
    archers from the country of Khammanua, which my hand
    had conquered, and I added it to the boundaries of this
    country. I put it in the hands of my Lieutenant, and I
    restituted the surface of the dominion, as it had been in
    the time of Gunzinan, the preceding King.</p>
<p>31  Tarhular, of Gamgum, had a son Muttallu, who had murdered
    his father by the arms, and sat on the throne against
    my will, and to whom they had intrusted their country.
    In the anger of my heart, I hastily marched against the
    town of Markasi, with my chariots and horsemen, who
    followed on my steps, I treated Muttallu, his son and the
    families of the country of Bit-Pa'alla in its totality, as
    captives, and seized as booty the gold and silver and the
    numberless treasures of his palace. I reinstated the men of
    Gamgum and the neighboring tribes, and placed my Lieutenant
    as Governor over them; I treated them like the
    Assyrians.</p>
<p>32  Azuri, King of Ashdod,[20] determined within himself to
    render no more tributes; he sent hostile messages against
    Assyria to the neighboring kings. I meditated vengeance
    for this, and I withdrew from him the government over
    his country. I put his brother Akhimit on his throne.
    But the people of Syria, eager for revolt, got tired of Akhimit's
    rule, and installed Iaman, who like the former, was
    not the legitimate master of the throne. In the anger of
    my heart, I did not assemble the bulk of my army nor
    divide my baggage, but I marched against Ashdod with
    my warriors, who did not leave the trace of my feet.</p>
<p>33  Iaman learnt from afar of the approach of my expedition;
    he fled beyond Egypt toward Libya (Meluhhi),[21] and no
    one ever saw any further trace of him. I besieged and
    took Ashdod and the town of Gimtu-Asdudim;[22] I carried
    away captive Iaman's gods, his wife, his sons, his daughters,
    his money, and the contents of his palace, together
    with the inhabitants of his country. I built these towns
    anew and placed in them the men that my arm had conquered.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>34  I placed my Lieutenant as Governor over them, and I
    treated them as Assyrians. They never again became
    guilty of impiety.</p>
<p>35  The King of Libya[23] lives in the middle of the desert, in an
    inaccessible place, at (a month's) journey. From the most
    remote times until the renewal of the lunar period[24] his
    fathers had sent no ambassadors to the kings, my ancestors,
    to ask for peace and friendship and to acknowledge the
    power of Merodach. But the immense terror inspired by
    my Majesty roused him, and fear changed his intentions.
    In fetters of iron he threw him (Iaman), directed his steps
    toward Assyria and kissed my feet.</p>
<p>36  Muttallu, of Commagene, a fraudulent and hostile man,
    did not honor the memory of the gods, he plotted a conspiracy,
    and meditated defection. He trusted upon Ar-gisti,[25]
    King of Armenia, an helper who did not assist him,
    took upon himself the collection of the tributes and his
    part of the spoil, and refused me his submission. In the
    anger of my heart, I took the road to his country with the
    chariots of my power, and the horsemen who never left
    the traces of my feet. Muttallu saw the approach of my
    expedition, he withdrew his troops, and no one saw any
    further trace of him. I besieged and occupied his capital
    and 62 large towns all together. I carried away his wife,
    his sons, his daughters, his money, his treasure, all precious
    things from his palace, together with the inhabitants of his
    country as spoil, I left none of them. I inaugurated this
    town afresh; I placed in it men from the country of Bit-Iakin,
    that my arm had conquered. I instituted my Lieutenant
    as Governor, and subdued them under my rule. I
    previously took from them 150 chariots, 1,500 horsemen,
    20,000 archers, 1,000 men armed with shields and lances,
    and I confided the country to my Satrap.</p>
<p>37  While Dalta, King of Ellip, lived, he was submissive and
    devoted to my rule, the infirmities of age however came
    and he walked on the path of death. Nibie and Ispabara,
    the sons of his wives, claimed both the vacant throne of
    his royalty, the country and the taxes, and they fought a
    battle. Nibie applied to Sutruk-Nakhunti[26] King of Elam
    to support his claims, giving to him pledges for his alliance,
    and the other came as a helper. Ispabara, on his side,
    implored me to maintain his cause, and to encourage him,
    at the same time bowing down, and humbling himself, and
    asking my alliance. I sent seven of my Lieutenants with
    their armies to support his claims, they put Nibie and the
    army of the four rivers,[27] which had helped him, to flight,
    at the town of Mareobisti. I reinstated Ispabara on the
    throne; I re-established peace in his country, and confided
    it to his care.</p>
<p>38  Merodach-Baladan, son of Iakin,[28] King of Chaldæa, the
    fallacious, the persistent in enmity, did not respect the
    memory of the gods, he trusted in the sea, and in the retreat
    of the marshes; he eluded the precepts of the great
    gods, and refused to send his tributes. He had supported
    as an ally Khumbanigas, King of Elam. He had excited
    all the nomadic tribes of the desert against me. He prepared
    himself for battle, and advanced. During twelve
    years,[29] against the will of the gods of Babylon, the town
    of Bel which judges the gods, he had excited the country
    of the Sumers and Accads, and had sent ambassadors to
    them. In honor of the god Assur, the father of the gods,
    and of the great and august Lord Merodach, I roused my
    courage, I prepared my ranks for battle. I decreed an
    expedition against the Chaldeans, an impious and riotous
    people. Merodach-Baladan heard of the approach of my
    expedition, dreading the terror of his own warriors, he fled
    before it, and flew in the night time like an owl, falling back
    from Babylon, to the town of Ikbibel. He assembled together
    the towns possessing oracles, and the gods living
    in these towns he brought to save them to Dur-Iakin, fortifying
    its walls. He summoned the tribes of Gambul,
    Pukud, Tamun, Ruhua, and Khindar, put them in this place,
    and prepared for battle. He calculated the extent of a
    plethrum[30] in front of the great wall. He constructed a
    ditch 200 spans[31] wide, and deep one fathom and a half.[32]
    The conduits of water, coming from the Euphrates, flowed
    out into this ditch; he had cut off the course of the river,
    and divided it into canals, he had surrounded the town,
    the place of his revolt, with a dam, he had filled it with
    water, and cut off the conduits. Merodach-Baladan, with
    his allies and his soldiers had the insignia of his royalty
    kept as in an island on the banks of the river; he arranged
    his plan of battle. I stretched my combatants all along
    the river dividing them into bands; they conquered the
    enemies. By the blood of the rebels the waters of these
    canals reddened like dyed wool. The nomadic tribes
    were terrified by this disaster which surprised him and fled;
    I completely separated his allies and the men of Marsan
    from him; I filled the ranks of the insurgents with mortal
    terror. He left in his tent the insignia of his royalty, the
    golden …[33] the golden throne, the golden parasol,
    the golden sceptre, the silver chariot, the golden ornaments,
    and other effects of considerable weight; he fled
    alone, and disappeared like the ruined battlements of his
    fortress, and I entered into his retreat. I besieged and
    occupied the town of Dur-Iakin, I took as spoil and made
    captive, him, his wife, his sons, his daughters, the gold
    and silver and all that he possessed, the contents of his
    palace, whatever it was, with considerable booty from the
    town. I made each family and every man who had withdrawn
    himself from my arms, accountable for this sin. I
    reduced Dur-Iakin the town of his power to ashes. I undermined
    and destroyed its ancient forts. I dug up the
    foundation stone;[34] I made it like a thunder-stricken ruin,
    I allowed the people of Sippara, Nipur, Babylon, and Borsippa,
    who live in the middle of the towns to exercise their
    profession, to enjoy their belongings in peace, and I have
    watched upon them. I took away the possession of the
    fields which from remote times had been in the hand of
    the <emphasis>Suti</emphasis> Nomad, and restored them to their rightful owners.
    I placed the nomadic tribes of the desert again under my
    yoke, and I restored the forgotten land delimitations which
    had existed during the tranquillity of the land. I gave to
    each of the towns of Ur, Orchoé, Erikhi, Larsa, Kullab,
    and Kisik, the dwelling of the god Laguda, the god that
    resides in each, and I restored the gods who had been
    taken away, to their sanctuaries. I re-established the
    altered laws in full force.</p>
<p>39  I imposed tributes on the countries of Bet-Iakin, the high
    and low part, and on the towns of Samhun, Bab-Dur, Dur-Tilit,
    Bubi, Tell-Khumba, which are the resort of Elam.
    I transplanted into Elam the inhabitants of the Commagene,
    in Syria, that I had attacked with my own hand,
    obeying the commands of the great gods my Masters, and
    I placed them on the territory of Elam, in the town of
    Sakbat. Nabu-Pakid-Ilan was authorized to collect the
    taxes from the Elamites in order to govern them; I claimed
    as a pledge the town of Birtu. I placed all this country
    in the hands of my Lieutenant at Babylon and my Lieutenant
    in the country of Gambul.[35]</p>
<p>40  I returned alone to Babylon, to the sanctuaries of Bel, the
    judge of the gods, in the excitement of my heart and the
    splendor of my appearance; I took the hands of the great
    Lord, the august god Merodach, and I traversed the way
    to the chamber of the spoil.</p>
<p>41  I transported into it 154 talents 26 minas 10 drachms of
    gold <emphasis>russù</emphasis>;[36] 1804 talents 20 minas of silver;[37] ivory,
    a great deal of copper, iron in an innumerable quantity,
    some of the stone <emphasis>ka</emphasis>, alabaster, the minerals <emphasis>pi digili</emphasis>,
    flattened <emphasis>pi sirru</emphasis> for witness seals, blue and purple stuffs,
    cloth of <emphasis>berom</emphasis> and cotton, ebony; cedar, and cypress wood,
    freshly cut from the fine forests on Mount Amanus, in
    honor of Bel, Zarpanit, Nebo, and Tasmit, and the gods
    who inhabit the sanctuaries of the Sumers and Accads; all
    that from my accession to the third year of my reign.[38]</p>
<p>42  Upir, King of Dilmun who dwells at the distance of 30
    parasanges[39] in the midst of the sea of the rising sun and
    who is established as a fish, heard of the favor that the gods
    Assur, Nebo, and Merodach had accorded me; he sent
    therefore his expiatory gift.</p>
<p>43  And the seven Kings of the country of Iahnagi, of the
    country of Iatnan (who have established and extended
    their dwellings at a distance of seven days' navigation in
    the midst of the sea of the setting sun, and whose name
    from the most ancient ages until the renewal of the lunar
    period,[40] none of the Kings my fathers in Assyria and
    Chaldea[41] had heard), had been told of my lofty achievements
    in Chaldea and Syria, and my glory, which had
    spread from afar to the midst of the sea. They subdued
    their pride and humbled themselves; they presented themselves
    before me at Babylon, bearing metals, gold, silver,
    vases, ebony wood, and the manufactures of their country;
    they kissed my feet.</p>
<p>44  While I endeavored to exterminate Bet-Iakin and reduce
    Aram, and render my rule more efficacious in the country
    of Iatbur, which is beyond Elam, my Lieutenant, the Governor
    of the country of Kue, attacked Mita, the Moschian,
    and 3,000 of his towns; he demolished these towns, destroyed
    them, burnt them with fire, and led away many
    captives. And this Mita the Moschian, who had never
    submitted to the Kings my predecessors and had never
    changed his will, sent his envoy to me to the very borders
    of the sea of the rising sun, bearing professions of allegiance
    and tributes.</p>
<p>45  In these days, these nations and these countries that my
    hand has conquered, and that the gods Assur, Nebo, and
    Merodach have made bow to my feet, followed the ways
    of piety. With their help I built at the feet of the <emphasis>musri</emphasis>,
    following the divine will and the wish of my heart, a town
    that I called <emphasis>Dur-Sarkin</emphasis>[42] to replace Nineveh.[43]
    Nisroch,[44] Sin, Samas, Nebo, Bin, Ninip, and their great
    spouses, who procreate eternally in the lofty temple of the upper
    and the nether world (Aralli) blessed the splendid wonders,
    the superb streets in the town of Dur-Sarkin. I reformed
    the institutions which were not agreeable to their ideas.
    The priests, the <emphasis>nisi ramki</emphasis>, the <emphasis>surmahhi supar</emphasis> disputed
    at their learned discussions about the pre-eminence of
    their divinities, and the efficacy of their sacrifices.</p>
<p>46  I built in the town some palaces covered with the skin of
    the sea-calf,[45] and of sandal wood, ebony, the wood of mastic
    tree, cedar, cypress, wild pistachio nut tree, a palace of
    incomparable splendor, as the seat of my royalty. I
    placed their <emphasis>dunu</emphasis> upon tablets of gold, silver, alabaster,
    <emphasis>tilpe</emphasis> stones, <emphasis>parut</emphasis> stones, copper, lead, iron, tin, and
    <emphasis>khibisti</emphasis> made of earth. I wrote thereupon the glory of the gods.
    Above I built a platform of cedar beams. I bordered the
    doors of pine and mastic wood with bronze garnitures,
    and I calculated their distance. I made a spiral staircase
    similar to the one in the great temple of Syria, that is
    called in the Phoenician language, <emphasis>Bethilanni</emphasis>. Between
    the doors I placed 8 double lions whose weight is 1 <emphasis>ner</emphasis> 6
    <emphasis>soss</emphasis>, 50 talents[46] of first-rate copper, made in honor of
    Mylitta …[47] and their four <emphasis>kubur</emphasis> in materials from
    Mount Amanus; I placed them on <emphasis>nirgalli</emphasis>.[8] Over them I
    sculptured artistically a crown of beast of the fields, a bird
    in stone of the mountains. Toward the four celestial regions,
    I turned their front. The lintels and the uprights
    I made in large gypsum stone that I had taken away with
    my own hand, I placed them above. I walled them in
    and I drew upon me the admiration of the people of the
    countries.</p>
<p>47  From the beginning to the end, I walked worshipping the
    god Assur, and following the custom of wise men, I built
    palaces, I amassed treasures.</p>
<p>48  In the month of blessing, on the happy day, I invoked,
    in the midst of them, Assur, the father of the gods, the
    greatest sovereign of the gods and the <emphasis>Istarât</emphasis>[49] who inhabit
    Assyria. I presented vessels of glass, things in
    chased silver, ivory, valuable jewels and immense presents,
    in great quantities, and I rejoiced their heart. I exhibited
    sculptured idols, double and winged, some …[50]
    winged, some …[50] winged, serpents, fishes, and birds,
    from unknown regions and abysses, the …[50] in high
    mountains, summits of the lands that I have conquered
    with my own hand, for the glory of my royalty. As a worshipper
    of the gods and the god Assur, I sacrificed in their
    presence, with the sacrifice of white lambs, holy holocausts
    of expiation, in order to withdraw the gifts that had not
    been agreeable to the gods.</p>
<p>49  He has granted me in his august power, a happy existence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    long life, and I obtained a constantly lucky reign.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have entrusted myself to his favor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>50  The great Lord Bel-El, the Master of the lands, inhabits</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    the lofty tracts; the gods and <emphasis>Istarât</emphasis> inhabit Assyria;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    their legions remain there in <emphasis>pargiti</emphasis>, and <emphasis>martakni</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>51  With the Chiefs of provinces, the Satraps, wise men,
    Astronomers, Magnates, the Lieutenants and Governors
    of Assyria, I have ruled in my palace, and administered
    justice.</p>
<p>52  I have bid them take gold, silver, gold and silver vessels,
    precious stones, copper, iron, considerable products of
    mountains the mines of which are rich, cloth of <emphasis>berom</emphasis> and
    cotton, blue and purple cloth, amber, skins of sea-calves,
    pearls, sandal-wood, ebony, horses from higher Egypt,[51]
    asses, mules, camels, oxen. With all these numerous
    tributes I have rejoiced the heart of the gods.</p>
<p>53  May Assur, the father of the gods, bless these palaces, by
    giving to his images a spontaneous splendor. May he
    watch over the issue even to the remote future. May the
    sculptured bull, the protector and god who imparts perfection,
    dwell in day and in night-time in his presence, and
    never stir from this threshold!</p>
<p>54  With the help of Assur, may the King who has built these
    palaces, attain an old age, and may his offspring multiply
    greatly! May these battlements last to the most remote
    future! May he who dwells there come forth surrounded
    with the greatest splendor; may he rejoice in his corporal
    health, in the satisfaction of his heart accomplish his
    wishes, attain his end, and may he render his magnificence
    seven times more imposing!</p>

"from the remotest times, the beginning of Assyria, until now." The
commencement of the period, 2517 B.C., coincided very nearly with the
capture of Babylon by the Medes. This date commences the real history;
previous to this time reigned the 86 princes during twelve lunar periods
of 1,805, and twelve solar periods of 1,460 years, viz., 39,180 years. The
very event may have happened eleven years afterward, 2506 B.C. The Deluge
happened, according to the Chaldeans, in 41697 B.C.]</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>
<p>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works</p>
<p>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
<p>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
<p>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>
<p>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.</p>
<p>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>
<p>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
<p>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>
<p>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
<p>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.</p>
<p>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>
<p>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
<p>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>
<p>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
<p>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>
<p>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
