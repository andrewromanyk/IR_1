<p>In my notes I have often given but brief references to the authors whom
I quote. The following list, which is not, however, so complete as I
could wish, will, I hope, do much towards supplying the deficiency.
Most of the poets, and a few of the prose writers also, I have not
found it needful to include, as my references apply equally well to
all editions of their works. The date in each case shows, not the
year of the original publication, but of the edition to which I have
referred.</p>

<p><strong>ADDENDA</strong></p>
<p>Last summer Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson sold some very interesting
autograph letters written by Johnson to William Strahan, the printer.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to find that the purchasers, with but one
exception, were mindful of what Boswell so well describes as 'the general
courtesy of literature[1],' and were ready to place their treasures
at my service. To one of them, Mr. Frederick Barker, of 43, Rowan Road,
Brook Green, I am still more indebted, for he entrusted me not only with
the original letters which he had just bought, but also with some others
that he had previously possessed. His Johnsonian collection is one of
unusual interest. I have moreover to acknowledge my obligations to
Mr. Fawcett, of 14, King Street, Covent Garden; to Messrs. J. Pearson
and Co., of 46, Pall Mall; to Messrs. Robson and Kerslake, of Coventry
Street, Haymarket; to Mr. Frank T. Sabin, of 10 and 12, Garrick Street,
Covent Garden; and to Mr. John Waller, of 2, Artesian Road, Westbourne
Grove. Those of the letters which are undated, I have endeavoured to
assign to their proper places by internal evidence. The absence of a
date is in itself very strong evidence that they belong to a comparatively
early period (see <emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 122, n. 2).</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>'SIR,</strong></p>
<p>'I have inclosed the Scheme which I mentioned yesterday in which the work
proposed is sufficiently explained.</p>
<p>'The Undertaker, Mr. Bathurst, is a Physician of the University of
Cambridge, of about eight years standing, and will perform the work in
such a manner as may satisfy the publick. No advice of mine will be
wanting, but advice will be all that I propose to contribute unless it
should be thought worth while that I should write a preface, which if
desired I will do and put my name to it. The terms which I am commissioned
to offer are these:</p>
<p>'1. A guinea and half shall be paid for each sheet of the copy.</p>
<p>'2. The authour will receive a Guinea and half a week from the date of
the Contract.</p>
<p>'3. As it is certain that many books will be necessary, the Authour will
at the end of the work take the books furnished him in part of payment
at prime Cost, which will be a considerable reduction of the price of
the Copy; or if it seems as you thought yesterday no reduction, he will
allow out of the last payment fifty pounds for the use of the Books and
return them.</p>
<p>'4. In two months after his first demand of books shall be supplied,
he purposes to write three Sheets a week and to continue the same
quantity to the end of the work, unless he shall be hindered by want of
Books. He does not however expect to be always able to write according
to the order of the Alphabet but as his Books shall happen to supply him,
and therefore cannot send any part to the press till the whole is nearly
finished.</p>
<p>'5. He undertakes as usual the Correction.</p>

<p><strong>'PROPOSAL.</strong></p>
<p>'There is nothing more apparently wanting to the English Literature,
than a Geographical Dictionary, which, though its use is almost every day
necessary, not only to Men of Study, but of Trade or publick employment,
yet has been hitherto, not only unperformed, but almost unattempted
among us. Bohun's Dictionary, the only one which has any pretension to
regard, owes that pretension only to its bulk; for it is in all parts
contemptibly defective and is therefore deservedly forgotten. In
Collier's Dictionary, what Geography there is, can scarcely be found
among the crowd of other subjects, and when it is found, is of no great
importance. The books of Eachard and Salmon, though useful for the ends
proposed by them, are too small to be considered as anticipations of this
work, which is intended to consist of two volumes of the same size and
print with Harris's Dictionary, in which will be comprised the following
particulars:</p>
<p>'The situation of every Country with its Provinces and dependencies
according to its present state, and latest observation.</p>
<p>'The description of all remarkable Cities, Towns, Castles, Fortresses,
and places observable for their situation, products or other particulars.</p>
<p>'An account of the considerable Rivers, their Springs, Branches, Course,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Outlets, how far navigable, the Produce and Qualities of their waters.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'The course of Voyages, giving directions to sailors for navigating
from one place of the World to another, with particular attention
to the Traffic of these Kingdoms.</p>
<p>'An account of all the principal Ports and Harbours of the known World,
in which will be laid down the Pilotage, Bearings, depth of water,
danger from Sands or Rocks, firmness or uncertainty of Anchorage, and
degree of safety from particular Winds.</p>
<p>'An exact account of the Commodities of each Country, both natural and
artificial.</p>
<p>'A description of the remarkable Animals in every Country, whether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beasts, Birds or Fishes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'An account of the Buildings, whether ancient or modern, and of Ruins
or other remains of Antiquity.</p>
<p>'Remarks upon the soil, air, and waters of particular Places, their
several qualities and effects, the accidents to which every Region is
exposed, as Earthquakes and Hurricanes, and the diseases peculiar to
the Inhabitants or incident to strangers at their arrival.</p>
<p>'The political State of the World, the Government of Countries, and the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Magistracy of Cities, with their particular Laws, or Privileges.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'The most probable and authentic Calculations of the number of Inhabitants
of each place.</p>
<p>'The military state of Countries, their Forces, manner of making War,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Weapons, and naval Power.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'The Commercial State, extent of their Trade, Number and strength of
their Colonies, quantity of Shipping.</p>
<p>'The pretensions of Princes with their Alliances, Relations and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Genealogies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'The customs of Nations with regard to Trade, and receptions of strangers,
their domestic Customs, as Rites of Marriage and Burial. Their particular
Laws. Their habits, recreations and amusements.</p>
<p>'The religious Opinions of all Nations.</p>
<p>'These and many other heads of observation will be collected, not merely
from the Dictionaries now extant in many Languages, but from the best
Surveys, Local Histories, Voyages, and particular accounts[1], among
which care will be taken to select those of the best authority, as the
basis of the Work, and to extract from them such observations as may
best promote Knowledge and gratify Enquiry, so that it is to be hoped,
there will be few remarkable places in the known World, of which the
Politician, the Merchant, the Sailor, or the Man of Curiosity may not
find a useful and pleasing account, of the credit of which the Reader
may always judge, as the Authors from whom it is taken will be regularly
quoted, a caution which if some, who have attempted such general works,
had observed, their labours would have deserved, and found more favour
from the Publick.'</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: That this is done will appear from the authours' names
exactly quoted.]</p>
<p>This letter must have been written about the year 1753, for Bathurst
is described as a physician of about eight years' standing. He took
his degree as Bachelor of Medicine at Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1745,
and did not, it should seem, proceed to the higher degree. In 1757
he was at the Havannah, where he died (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 242, n. i). He was
Johnson's beloved friend, of whom 'he hardly ever spoke without tears
in his eyes' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 190, n. 2). The Proposal, I have no doubt,
was either written, or at all events revised, by Johnson. It is quite
in his style. It may be assumed that it is in Bathurst's handwriting.</p>

<p>'To Mr. Strahan.'</p>
<p>In all likelihood Johnson is writing about the Dictionary. The absence
of a date, as I have already said, is strong evidence that the letter
was written comparatively early. As the first edition of the Dictionary
was in folio a sheet consisted of four pages. Johnson writing on April
3, 1753 says, 'I began the second vol. of my Dictionary, room being left
in the first for Preface, Grammar, and History, none of them yet begun'
(<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 255). As the book was published on April 15, 1755 (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>,
i. 290, n. 1), the printing must have gone on very rapidly, when a
start was once made. By <emphasis>copy</emphasis> he means his <emphasis>manuscript for printing</emphasis>.</p>

<p><strong>'SIR,</strong></p>
<p>'I have often suspected that it is as you say, and have told Mr. Dodsley
of it. It proceeds from the haste of the amanuensis to get to the end
of his day's work. I have desired the passages to be clipped close, and
then perhaps for two or three leaves it is done. But since poor Stuart's
time I could never get that part of the work into regularity, and
perhaps never shall. I will try to take some more care but can promise
nothing; when I am told there is a sheet or two I order it away. You
will find it sometimes close; when I make up any myself, which never
happens but when I have nobody with me, I generally clip it close, but
one cannot always be on the watch.</p>

<p>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>These letters refer to the printing of the <emphasis>Dictionary</emphasis>, of which
Dodsley and Millar were two among the proprietors, and Strahan the
printer. Francis Stuart or Stewart was one of Johnson's amanuenses
(<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 187). In 1779 Johnson paid his sister a guinea for an old
pocket-book of her brother's (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iii. 418), and wrote on April
8,1780 (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iii. 421):—'The memory of her brother is yet fresh
in my mind; he was an ingenious and worthy man.' In February 1784 he
gave her another guinea for a letter relating to himself that he had
found in the pocket-book (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iv. 262). A writer in the <emphasis>Gent. Mag.</emphasis>
for 1799, p. 1171, who had been employed in Strahan's printing-works,
says that 'Stewart was useful to Johnson in the explanation of low cant
phrases; all words relating to gambling and card-playing, such as
<emphasis>All-Fours</emphasis>, <emphasis>Catch-honours</emphasis> [not in Johnson's Dictionary], <emphasis>Cribbage</emphasis>
[merely defined as <emphasis>A game at cards</emphasis>], were said to be Stewart's
corrected by the Doctor.' He adds that after the printing had gone
on some time 'the proprietors of the <emphasis>Dictionary</emphasis> paid Johnson through
Mr. Strahan at the rate of a guinea for every sheet of MS. copy delivered.
The copy was written upon quarto post, and in two columns each page.
Johnson wrote in his own hand the words and their explanation, and
generally two or three words in each column, leaving a space between
each for the authorities, which were pasted on as they were collected
by the different amanuenses employed: and in this mode the MS. was so
regular that the sheets of MS. which made a sheet of print could be
very exactly ascertained.' The same writer states that Stewart in a
night ramble in Edinburgh with some of his drinking companions 'met with
the mob conducting Captain Porteous to be hanged; they were next day
examined about it before the Town Council, when, as Stewart used to say,
"we were found to be too drunk to have any hand in the business." He
gave an accurate account of it in the Edinburgh Magazine of that time.'</p>

<p><emphasis>A letter about Miss Williams, taxes due, and a journey; undated, but
perhaps written at Oxford in 1754</emphasis>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick
Barker.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>'SIR,</strong></p>
<p>'I shall not be long here, but in the mean time if Miss Williams wants
any money pray speak to Mr. Millar and supply her, they write to me
about some taxes which I wish you would pay.</p>
<p>'My journey will come to very little beyond the satisfaction of knowing
that there is nothing to be done, and that I leave few advantages here
to those that shall come after me.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>'SAM. JOHNSON.'</strong></p>
<p>'My compliments to Mrs. Strahan.</p>
<p>To Mr. Strahan.'</p>
<p>Miss Williams came to live with Johnson after his wife's death in 1752
(<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 232). The fact that Strahan is asked to supply her with
money after speaking to Mr. Millar seems to show that this letter was
written some time before the publication of the <emphasis>Dictionary</emphasis> in April
1755. Millar 'took the principal charge of conducting its publication,'
and Johnson 'had received all the copy-money, by different drafts, a
considerable time before he had finished his task' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 287).</p>
<p>His 'journey' may have been his visit to Oxford in the summer of 1754.
He went there, because, 'I cannot,' he said, 'finish my book [the
Dictionary] to my mind without visiting the libraries' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 270).
According to Thomas Warton 'he collected nothing in the libraries for
his <emphasis>Dictionary</emphasis>' (<emphasis>ib</emphasis> n. 5). It is perhaps to this failure that the
latter part of the letter refers, Johnson's visit, however, was one of
five weeks, while the first line of the letter shews that he intended
to be away from London but a short time.</p>

<p><strong>VI.</strong></p>
<p><emphasis>A letter about 'Rasselas,' dated</emphasis> Jan. 20, 1759.[In the possession of

preparing for the press. The title will be</p>
<p>"The Choice of Life</p>

<p>'It will make about two volumes like little Pompadour, that is about
one middling volume. The bargain which I made with Mr. Johnson was
seventy five pounds (or guineas) a volume, and twenty five pounds for
the second edition. I will sell this either at that price or for sixty[2],
the first edition of which he shall himself fix the number, and the
property then to revert to me, or for forty pounds, and I have the
profit that is retain half the copy. I shall have occasion for thirty
pounds on Monday night when I shall deliver the book which I must
entreat you upon such delivery to procure me. I would have it offered
to Mr. Johnson, but have no doubt of selling it, on some of the terms
mentioned.</p>

Jan. 20, 1759.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Get me the money if you can.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This letter is of unusual interest, as it proves beyond all doubt that
<emphasis>Rasselas</emphasis> was written some weeks before <emphasis>Candide</emphasis> was published (see
<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 342, n. a). Baretti, as I have shewn (i. 341, n. 3), says
that 'any other person with the degree of reputation Johnson then
possessed would have got £400 for the work, but he never understood
the art of making the most of his productions.' We see, however, by
this letter that Johnson did ask for a larger sum than the booksellers
allowed him. He received but one hundred pounds for the first edition,
but he had made a bargain for one hundred and fifty pounds or guineas.
Johnson, the bookseller, seems to have been but in a small way of
business as a publisher. I do not find in the <emphasis>Gentleman's Magazine</emphasis>
for 1758 any advertisement of books published by him, and only one in
1759 (P. 339). Cowper's publisher in 1778 was Joseph Johnson of St.
Paul's Churchyard. (Cowper's <emphasis>Works</emphasis> by Southey, i. 285; see also
Nichols' <emphasis>Literary Anecdotes</emphasis>, iii. 461-464.)</p>
<p>By 'little Pompadour' Johnson, no doubt, means the second and cheaper
edition of <emphasis>The History of the Marchioness de Pompadour</emphasis>. The first
edition was published by Hooper in one volume, price five shillings
(<emphasis>Gent. Mag</emphasis>. for October 1758, p. 493). and the second in two volumes
for three shillings and sixpence (<emphasis>Gent. Mag</emphasis>. for November, 1758,
p. 543).</p>
<p>Johnson did not generally 'print his name.' He published anonymously his
translation of <emphasis>Lobos Voyage to Abyssinia; London; The Life of Savage;
The Rambler</emphasis>, and <emphasis>The Idler</emphasis>, both in separate numbers and when
collected in volumes; <emphasis>Rasselas; The False Alarm; Falkland's Islands;
The Patriot;</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Taxation no Tyranny</emphasis>; (when these four pamphlets
were collected in a volume he published them with the title of <emphasis>Political
Tracts, by the Authour of the Rambler</emphasis>). He gave his name in <emphasis>The Vanity
of Human Wishes, Irene</emphasis>, the <emphasis>Dictionary</emphasis>, his edition of <emphasis>Shakespeare</emphasis>,
the <emphasis>Journey to the Western Islands</emphasis>, and the <emphasis>Lives of the Poets</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>A letter about George Strahan's election to a scholarship at University

dated October 24, 1764</emphasis>.[In the possession of Mr. Frederick Barker.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>'SIR,</strong></p>
<p>'I think I have pretty well disposed of my young friend George, who, if
you approve of it, will be entered next Monday a Commoner of University
College, and will be chosen next day a Scholar of the House. The
Scholarship is a trifle, but it gives him a right, upon a vacancy, to
a Fellowship of more than sixty pounds a year if he resides, and I
suppose of more than forty if he takes a Curacy or small living. The
College is almost filled with my friends, and he will be well treated.
The Master is informed of the particular state of his education, and
thinks, what I think too, that for Greek he must get some private
assistance, which a servitour of the College is very well qualified
and will be very willing to afford him on very easy terms.</p>
<p>'I must desire your opinion of this scheme by the next post, for the
opportunity will be lost if we do not now seize it, the Scholarships
being necessarily filled up on Tuesday.</p>
<p>'I depend on your proposed allowance of a hundred a year, which must
the first year be a little enlarged because there are some extraordinary
expenses, as</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Caution (which is allowed in his last quarter). .     7 0 0
Thirds. (He that enters upon a room pays two
thirds of the furniture that he finds, and
receives from his successor two thirds of what
he pays; so that if he pays £20 he receives
£13 6s. 8d., this perhaps may be)                    12  0 0
Fees at entrance, matriculation &amp;c., perhaps          2  0 0
His gown (I think)                                    2 10 0

<p>'If you send us a Bill for about thirty pounds we shall set out
commodiously enough. You should fit him out with cloaths and linen,
and let him start fair, and it is the opinion of those whom I consult,
that with your hundred a year and the petty scholarship he may live
with great ease to himself, and credit to you.</p>
<p>'Let me hear as soon as is possible.</p>
<p>'In your affair with the university, I shall not be consulted, but I
hear nothing urged against your proposal.</p>

<p>'My compliments to Mrs. Strahan.</p>
<p>'To Mr. Strahan, Printer, in New Street, Shoe-lane, London.'</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. C. J. Faulkner, Fellow and Tutor of University College,
has given me the following extracts from the College records:—</p>
<p>'Oct. 30-31, 1764. Candidatis examinatis electi sunt Gulielmus Jones
et Georgius Strahan in vacuas Exhibitiones Dmi Simonis Benet Baronetti.'</p>
<p>Gulielmus Jones is the famous oriental scholar, Sir William Jones, whose
portrait adorns the Hall of his ancient College (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, ii. 25, n. 2).</p>
<p>On April 16, 1767, is found the election of 'Georgium Strahan, sophistam
in perpetuum hujus Collegii Socium.'</p>
<p>He vacated his fellowship in 1773.</p>
<p>The value of a Bennet scholarship in 1764 was ten pounds a year, with
rooms added, the rent of which was reckoned as equal to two pounds more.
A fellowship on the same foundation was worth about twenty pounds, with
a yearly dividend added to it that amounted to about thirty pounds.
'Fines' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iii. 323) and other extra payments might easily raise
the value to more than sixty pounds.</p>
<p>The 'caution' is the sum deposited by an undergraduate with the College
Bursar or Steward as a security for the payment of his 'battells' or
account. Johnson in 1728 had to pay at Pembroke College the same sum
(seven pounds) that George Strahan in 1764 had to pay at University
College. <emphasis>Ante</emphasis>, i. 58, n. 2.</p>
<p>Johnson wrote four letters to George Strahan, when he was a boy at
school, and one letter when he was at College. (See Croker's <emphasis>Johnson</emphasis>,
pp. 129, 130, 161, 168.) In this last letter, dated May 25, 1765, he
writes: 'Do not tire yourself so much with Greek one day as to be afraid
of looking on it the next; but give it a certain portion of time,
suppose four hours, and pass the rest of the day in Latin or English.
I would have you learn French, and take in a literary journal once a

<p>William Strahan's 'affair with the University' was very likely connected
with the lease of the University Printing House. From the 'Orders of

Johnson's letter.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>'SIR,</strong></p>
<p>'I waited on you this morning having forgotten your new engagement; for
this you must not reproach me, for if I had looked upon your present
station with malignity I could not have forgotten it. I came to consult
you upon a little matter that gives me some uneasiness. In one of the
pages there is a severe censure of the clergy of an English Cathedral
which I am afraid is just, but I have since recollected that from me
it may be thought improper, for the Dean did me a kindness about forty
years ago. He is now very old, and I am not young. Reproach can do
him no good, and in myself I know not whether it is zeal or wantonness.
Can a leaf be cancelled without too much trouble? tell me what I shall
do. I have no settled choice, but I would not wish to allow the charge.
To cancel it seems the surer side. Determine for me.</p>

<p>Mr. Strahan's 'new engagement' was in the House of Commons at Westminster,</p>

<p>

to which he had been elected for the first time as member for Malmesbury.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The new Parliament had met on Nov. 29, the day before the date of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Johnson's letter (<emphasis>Parl. Hist</emphasis>, xviii. 23).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The leaf that Johnson cancelled contained pages 47, 48 in the first
edition of his <emphasis>Journey to the Western Islands</emphasis>. It corresponds with
pages 19-30 in vol. ix. of Johnson's <emphasis>Works</emphasis> (ed. 1825), beginning
with the words 'could not enter,' and ending 'imperfect constitution.'
The excision is marked by a ridge of paper, which was left that the
revised leaf might be attached to it. Johnson describes how the lead
which covered the Cathedrals of Elgin and Aberdeen had been stripped
off by the order of the Scottish Council, and shipped to be sold in
Holland. He continues:—'Let us not however make too much haste to
despise our neighbours. Our own cathedrals are mouldering by unregarded
dilapidation. It seems to be part of the despicable philosophy of the
time to despise monuments of sacred magnificence, and we are in danger
of doing that deliberately,  which the Scots did not do but in the
unsettled state of an imperfect constitution.'</p>
<p>In the copy of the first edition in the Bodleian Library, which had
belonged to Gough the antiquary, there is written in his hand, as a
foot-note to 'neighbours': 'There is now, as I have heard, a body
of men not less decent or virtuous than the Scottish Council, longing
to melt the lead of an English Cathedral. What they shall melt, it
were just that they should swallow.' It can scarcely be doubted that
this is the suppressed passage. The English Cathedral to which Johnson
refers was, I believe, Lichfield. 'The roof,' says Harwood (History of
Lichfield, p. 75), 'was formerly covered with lead, but now with slate.'
Addenbroke, who had been Dean since 1745, was, we may assume, very old
at the time when Johnson wrote. I had at first thought it not unlikely
that it was Dr. Thomas Newton, Dean of St. Paul's and Bishop of Bristol,
who was censured. He was a Lichfield man, and was known to Johnson (see
<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iv. 285, n. 3). He was, however, only seventy years old. I am
informed moreover by the Rev. W. Sparrow Simpson, the learned editor
of <emphasis>Documents illustrating the History of St. Paul's</emphasis>, that it is
very improbable that at this time the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's
entertained such a thought.</p>
<p>My friend Mr. C. E. Doble has kindly furnished me with the following
curious parallel to Johnson's suppressed wish about the molten lead.</p>
<p>'The chappell of our Lady [at Wells], late repayred by Stillington,
a place of great reverence and antiquitie, was likewise defaced, and
such was their thirst after lead (I would they had drunke it scalding)
that they tooke the dead bodies of bishops out of their leaden coffins,
and cast abroad the carkases skarce throughly putrified.'—Harington's
<emphasis>Nuga Antiquae</emphasis>, ii. 147 (ed. 1804).</p>
<p>In the postscript Johnson says 'Please to direct to the borough.' He
was staying in Mr. Thrale's town-house in the Borough of Southwark.

<p>'You will please to remember that I once asked you to receive an

house, but who is mishapen, though I think not so as to hinder him
at the case. It will be expected that I should answer his Friend
who has hitherto maintained him, whether I can help him to a place.
He can give no money, but will be kept in cloaths.</p>
<p>'I have another request which it is perhaps not immediately in your
power to gratify. I have a presentation to beg for the blue coat
hospital. The boy is a non-freeman, and has both his parents living.
We have a presentation for a freeman which we can give in exchange.
If in your extensive acquaintance you can procure such an exchange,
it will be an act of great kindness. Do not let the matter slip out
of your mind, for though I try others I know not any body of so much
power to do it.</p>

<p><strong>'SIR,</strong></p>

'SAM. JOHNSON.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'March 1, 1775.'</p>
<p>This letter refers to <emphasis>Taxation no Tyranny</emphasis>, which was published before
March 31, 1775, the date of Boswell's arrival in London (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, ii.
311). Boswell says that he had in his possession 'a few proof leaves
of it marked with corrections in Johnson's own hand-writing' (ib. p.
313). Johnson, he says,' owned to me that it had been revised and
curtailed by some of those who were then in power.' When Johnson writes
'when you print it, if you print it,' he uses, doubtless, <emphasis>print</emphasis> in
the sense of <emphasis>striking off copies</emphasis>. The pamphlet was, we may assume, in
type before it was revised by 'those in power.' The corrections had been
made in the proof-sheets. Johnson asks to have six copies laid by for
him in the state in which he had wished to publish it. It seems that the
last paragraph had been struck out by the reviser, for Johnson says 'it
was rather contemptuous.' He does not think it needful to supply anything
in its place, for he says 'it concludes well enough as it is.'</p>
<p>Mr. Strahan had the right, as a member of Parliament, to frank all
letters and packets. That is to say, by merely writing his signature on
the cover he could pass them through the post free of charge. Johnson,
when he wrote to Scotland, used to employ him to frank his letters,
'that he might have the consequence of appearing a parliament-man among
his countrymen' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iii. 364). It was to Oxford that a copy of the
pamphlet was to be franked to Johnson. That he was there at the time is
shown by a letter from him in Mrs. Piozzi's <emphasis>Collection</emphasis> (vol. i. p.
212), dated 'University College, Oxford, March 3, 1775.' Writing to her,
evidently from Bolt Court, on February 3, he had said: 'My pamphlet has
not gone on at all' (ib. i. 211). Mrs. Aston (or rather Miss Aston) is

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>'SIR,</strong></p>
<p>'I wrote to you about ten days ago, and sent you some copy. You have
not written again, that is a sorry trick.</p>
<p>'I am told that you are printing a Book for Mr. Professor Watson of
Saint Andrews, if upon any occasion, I can give any help, or be of any
use, as formerly in Dr. Robertson's publication, I hope you will make
no scruple to call upon me, for I shall be glad of an opportunity to

'SAM. JOHNSON.'</p>

<p>'Oct. 14, 1776.'</p>
<p>The' copy' or MS. that Johnson sent is, I conjecture, <emphasis>Proposals for
the Rev. Mr. Shaw's Analysis of the Scotch Celtick Language</emphasis> (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>,
iii. 107). This is the only acknowledged piece of writing of his during
1776. The book printing for Professor Watson was <emphasis>History of the Reign
of Philip II</emphasis>, which was published by Strahan and Cadell in 1777. This
letter is of unusual interest, as showing that Johnson had been of some
service as regards one of Robertson's books. It is possible that he
read some of the proof-sheets, and helped to get rid of the Scotticisms.
'Strahan,' according to Beattie, 'had corrected (as he told me himself)
the phraseology of both Mr. Hume and Dr. Robertson' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, v. 92,
n. 3). He is not unlikely, in Robertson's case, to have sought and
obtained Johnson's help.</p>

<p>'To Dr. TAYLOR. Dated London, April 20, 1778.'</p>
<p>'The quantity of blood taken from you appears to me not sufficient.
Thrale was almost lost by the scrupulosity of his physicians, who never
bled him copiously till they bled him in despair; he then bled till he
fainted, and the stricture or obstruction immediately gave way and from
that instant he grew better.</p>
<p>'I can now give you no advice but to keep yourself totally quiet and
amused with some gentle exercise of the mind. If a suspected letter
comes, throw it aside till your health is reestablished; keep easy and
cheerful company about you, and never try to think but at those stated
and solemn times when the thoughts are summoned to the cares of futurity,
the only cares of a rational being.</p>
<p>'As to my own health I think it rather grows better; the convulsions
which left me last year at Ashbourne have never returned, and I have by
the mercy of God very comfortable nights. Let me know very often how you
are till you are quite well.'</p>
<p>This letter, though it is dated 1778, must have been written in 1780.
Thrale's first attack was in June, 1779, when he was in 'extreme danger'
(<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iii. 397, n. 2, 420). Johnson had the remission of the
convulsions on June 18, 1779. He recorded on June 18, 1780:—</p>
<p>'In the morning of this day last year I perceived the remission of
those convulsions in my breast which had distressed me for more than
twenty years. I returned thanks at church for the mercy granted me,
which has now continued a year.'—<emphasis>Prayers and Meditations</emphasis>, p. 183.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Three days later he wrote to Mrs. Thrale:—</p>
<p>'It was a twelvemonth last Sunday since the convulsions in my breast
left me. I hope I was thankful when I recollected it; by removing
that disorder a great improvement was made in the enjoyment of life.'

<p>He was at Ashbourne on June 18, 1779 (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iii. 453).</p>
<p>On April 20, 1778, the very day of which this letter bears the date,
he recorded:—</p>
<p>'After a good night, as I am forced to reckon, I rose seasonably….
In reviewing my time from Easter, 1777, I found a very melancholy
and shameful blank. So little has been done that days and months are
without any trace. My health has, indeed, been very much interrupted.
My nights have been commonly not only restless, but painful and fatiguing.
….Some relaxation of my breast has been procured, I think, by opium,
 which, though it never gives me sleep, frees my breast from spasms.'

<p>'Conscious, notwithstanding, that to avoid writing what is <emphasis>unnecessary</emphasis>
is, in these days, no just plea for silence in a biographer, I have some
apology to make for having strewed these pages so thinly with the
tittle-tattle of anecdote. I am, however, too proud to make this apology
to any person but my bookseller, who will be the only real loser by the
'Those readers, who believe that I do not write immediately under
his pay, and who may have gathered from what they have already read,
that I am not so passionately enamoured of Dr. Johnson's biographical
manner, as to take that for my model, have only to throw these pages
aside, and wait till they are new-written by some one of his numerous
disciples, who may follow his master's example; and should more anecdote
than I furnish him with be wanting (as was the Doctor's case in his
life of Mr. Gray), may make amends for it by those acid eructations
of vituperative criticism, which are generated by unconcocted taste and

… however, she always retained her affection for them. While they
[Mr. and Mrs. Johnson] resided in Gough Square, her son, the officer,
knocked at the door, and asked the maid if her mistress was at home.
She answered, "Yes, Sir, but she is sick in bed." "Oh," says he, "if
it's so, tell her that her son Jervis called to know how she did;" and
was going away. The maid begged she might run up to tell her mistress,
and, without attending his answer, left him. Mrs. Johnson, enraptured
to hear her son was below, desired the maid to tell him she longed to
embrace him. When the maid descended the gentleman was gone, and poor
Mrs. Johnson was much agitated by the adventure; it was the only time
he ever made an effort to see her. Dr. [Mr.] Johnson did all he could
to console his wife, but told Mrs. Williams: "Her son is uniformly
undutiful; so I conclude, like many other sober men, he might once in
his life be drunk, and in that fit nature got the better of his pride."'</p>

<p><emphasis>Johnson's knowledge of Italian</emphasis>.</p>
<p>(Vol. i, p. 115.)</p>
<p>Boswell says that he does not know 'at what time, or by what means
Johnson had acquired a competent knowledge of Italian.' In my note
on this I say 'he had read Petrarch "when but a boy."' As Petrarch
wrote chiefly in Latin, it is quite possible that Johnson did not
acquire his knowledge of Italian so early as I had thought.</p>

<p><emphasis>Johnson's deference for the general opinion</emphasis>.</p>
<p>(Vol. i, p. 200.)</p>
<p>Miss Burney records an interesting piece of criticism by Johnson. 'There
are,' he said, 'three distinct kinds of judges upon all new authors or
productions; the first are those who know no rules, but pronounce
entirely from their natural taste and feelings; the second are those who
know and judge by rules; and the third are those who know, but are above
the rules. These last are those you should wish to satisfy. Next to them
rate the natural judges; but ever despise those opinions that are formed
by the rules.'—<emphasis>Mine. D'Arblay's Diary</emphasis>, i. 180. Later on she writes:
—'The natural feelings of untaught hearers ought never to be slighted;
and Dr. Johnson has told me the same a thousand times;' ib. ii. 128.</p>

<p><emphasis>Johnson in the Green Room</emphasis>.</p>
<p>(Vol. i, p. 201.)</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Herne Shepherd, in <emphasis>Watford's Antiquarian</emphasis> for January,
1887, p. 34, asserts that the actual words which Johnson used when
he told Garrick that he would no longer frequent his Green Room were
indecent; so indecent that Mr. Shepherd can only venture to satisfy
those whom he calls students by informing them of them privately. For
proof of this charge against the man whose boast it was that 'obscenity
had always been repressed in his company' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, iv. 295) he brings
forward John Wilkes. The story, indeed, as it is told by Boswell, is
not too trustworthy, for he had it through Hume from Garrick. As it
reaches Mr. Shepherd it comes from Garrick through Wilkes. Garrick, no
doubt, as Johnson says (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, v. 391), was, as a companion, 'restrained
by some principle,' and had 'some delicacy of feeling.' Nevertheless,
in his stories, he was, we may be sure, no more on oath than a man is
in lapidary inscriptions (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, ii. 407). It is possible that he
reported  Johnson's very words to Hume, and that Hume did not change
them in reporting them to Boswell. Whatever they were, they were spoken
in 1749 and published in 1791, when Johnson had been dead six years,
Garrick twelve years, and Hume fourteen years. It is idle to dream that
they can now be conjecturally  emended. But it is worse than idle to
bring in as evidence John Wilkes. What entered his ear as purity itself
might issue from his mouth as the grossest obscenity. He had no delicacy
of feeling. No principle restrained him. When he comes to bear testimony,
and aims a shaft at any man's character, the bow that he draws is drawn
with the weakness of the hand of a worn-out and shameless profligate.</p>
<p>Mr. Shepherd quotes an unpublished letter of Boswell to Wilkes, dated
Rome, April 22, 1765, to show 'that the two men had become familiars,
not only long before Wilkes's famous meeting with Dr. Johnson was brought
about, but before even the friendship of Boswell himself with Johnson
had been consolidated.' It needs no unpublished letters to show that. It
must be known to every attentive reader of Boswell. See <emphasis>ante</emphasis>, i. 395,

Oxford, 1885.</p>
<p>'The <emphasis>Advertisement to Religion and Policy, by Edward Earl of Clarendon</emphasis>,
runs as follows:—</p>
<p>"Henry Viscount Cornbury, who was called up to the House of Peers
by the title of Lord Hyde, in the lifetime of his father, Henry Earl
of Rochester, by a codicil to his will, dated Aug. 10, 1751, left
divers MSS. of his great grandfather, Edward Earl of Clarendon, to
Trustees, with a direction that the money to arise from the sale or
publication thereof, should be employed as a beginning of a fund for
supporting a Manage or Academy for riding and other useful exercises
in Oxford; a plan of this sort having been also recommended by Lord
Clarendon in his Dialogue  on Education. Lord Cornbury dying before
his father, this bequest did not take effect. But Catharine, one of
the daughters of Henry Earl of Rochester, and late Duchess Dowager
of Queensbury, whose property these MSS. became, afterwards by deed
gave them, together with all the monies which had arisen or might arise
from the sale or publication of them, to [three Trustees] upon trust
for the like purposes as those expressed by Lord Hyde in his codicil."</p>
<p>'The preface to the <emphasis>Life of Edward Earl of Clarendon, written by
himself</emphasis>., has words to the same effect. (See also <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>,
Ser. I. x. 185, and xi. 32.)</p>
<p>'From a letter in <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>, Ser. II. x. p. 74, it appears
that in 1860 the available sum, in the hands of the Trustees of the
Clarendon Bequest, amounted to £10,000. The University no longer needed
a riding-school, and the claims of Physical Science were urgent; and in
1872 the announcement was made, that by the liberality of the Clarendon
Trustees an additional wing had been added to the University Museum,
containing the lecture-rooms and laboratories of the department of
Experimental Philosophy.' Vol. i. p. 305.</p>

<p>'At the dinner table he continued the debate in such angry tones, and
struck the table so violently that the children were frightened, and

<p>'The next morning Dr. Johnson went to the bank [Mr. Lloyd was a banker]
and by way of apology called out in his stentorian voice, "I say, Lloyd,
I'm the best theologian, but you are the best Christian.'" p. 41. It
could not have been 'the next morning' that Johnson went to the bank,
for he left for Lichfield on the evening of the day of the controversy
(<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, ii. 461). He must have gone in the afternoon, while Boswell
was away seeing Mr. Boulton's great works at Soho (ib. p. 459).</p>
<p>Mr. G. B. Lloyd, the great-grandson of Johnson's host, in a letter
written this summer (1886), says: 'Having spent much of my boyhood
with my grandfather in the old house, I have heard him tell the story
of the stamping on the broad volume.'</p>
<p>Boswell mentions (ib. p. 457) that 'Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd, like their
Majesties, had been blessed with a numerous family of fine children,
their numbers being exactly the same.' The author of <emphasis>Farm and its
Inhabitants</emphasis> says (p. 46): 'There is a tradition that when Sampson
Lloyd's wife used to feel depressed by the care of such a large family
(they had sixteen children) he would say to her, "Never mind, the
twentieth will be the most welcome."' His fifteenth child Catharine
married Dr. George Birkbeck, the founder of the Mechanics' Institutes
(ib. p. 48).</p>
<p>A story told (p. 50) of one of Mr. Lloyd's sons-in-law, Joseph Biddle,
is an instance of that excess of forgetfulness which Johnson called
'morbid oblivion' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, v. 68). 'He went to pay a call in Leamington.
The servant asked him for his name, he could not remember it; in
perplexity he went away, when a friend in the street met him and
accosted him, "How do you do, Mr. Biddle?" "Oh, Biddle, Biddle, Biddle,
that's the name," cried he, and rushed off to pay his call.'</p>

<p>(Vol. ii, p. 461.)</p>
<p>C. P. Moritz, a young Prussian clergyman who published an account of
a pedestrian tour that he made in England in the year 1782, thus describes
Lichfield as he saw it on a day in June:—</p>
<p>'At noon I got to Lichfield, an old-fashioned town with narrow dirty
streets, where for the first time I saw round panes of glass in the
windows. The place to me wore an unfriendly appearance; I therefore
made no use of my recommendation, but went straight through and only
bought some bread at a baker's, which I took along with me.'—<emphasis>Travels
in England in 1782</emphasis>, p. 140, by C. P. Moritz. Cassell's National Library,
1886.</p>
<p>The 'recommendation' was an introduction to an inn given him by the
daughter of his landlord at Sutton, who told him 'that the people in
Lichfield were, in general, very proud.' Travelling as he did, on foot
and without luggage, he was looked upon with suspicion at the inns,
and often rudely refused lodging.</p>

<p><emphasis>Richard Baxter's doubt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>(Vol. ii, p. 477.)</p>
<p>The Rev. J. Hamilton Davies [See <emphasis>ante</emphasis>, p. xlix. 1] informs me that
there can be no doubt that Johnson referred to the following passage
in <emphasis>Reliquiae Baxterianae</emphasis>, folio edition of 1696, p. 127:—</p>
<p>'This is another thing which I am changed in; that whereas in my
younger days I was never tempted to doubt of the Truth of Scripture
or Christianity, but all my Doubts and Fears were exercised at home,
about my own Sincerity and Interest in Christ—since then my sorest
assaults have been on the other side, and such they were, that had I
been void of internal Experience, and the adhesion of Love, and the
special help of God, and had not discerned more Reason for my Religion
than I did when I was younger, I had certainly apostatized to Infidelity,'
&amp;c.</p>
<p>Johnson, the day after he recorded his 'doubt,' wrote that he was
'troubled with Baxter's <emphasis>scruple</emphasis>' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, ii. 477). The 'scruple'
was, perhaps, the same as the 'doubt.' In his <emphasis>Dictionary</emphasis> he defines
<emphasis>scruple</emphasis> as <emphasis>doubt; difficulty of determination; perplexity; generally
about minute things</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>Oxford in 1782</emphasis>.</p>
<p>(Vol. iii, p. 13, n. 3.)</p>
<p>The Rev. C. P. Moritz (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>, p. liv) gives a curious account of
his visit to Oxford. On his way from Dorchester on the evening of
a Sunday in June, he had been overtaken by the Rev. Mr. Maud, who seems
to have been a Fellow and Tutor of Corpus College[3], and who was
returning from doing duty in his curacy. It was late when they arrived
in the town. Moritz, who, as I have said, more than once had found
great difficulty in getting a bed, had made up his mind to pass the
summer night on a stonebench in the High Street. His comrade would not
hear of this, but said that he would take him to an ale-house where
'it is possible they mayn't be gone to bed, and we may yet find company.'
This ale-house was the Mitre.</p>
<p>'We went on a few houses further, and then knocked at a door. It was
then nearly twelve. They readily let us in; but how great was my
astonishment when, on being shown into a room on the left, I saw
a great number of clergymen, all with their gowns and bands on, sitting
round a large table, each with his pot of beer before him. My travelling
companion introduced me to them as a German clergyman, whom he could not
sufficiently praise for my correct pronunciation of the Latin, my
orthodoxy, and my good walking.</p>
<p>'I now saw myself in a moment, as it were, all at once transported
into the midst of a company, all apparently very respectable men, but
all strangers to me. And it appeared to me extraordinary that I should
thus at midnight be in Oxford, in a large company of Oxonian clergy,
without well knowing how I had got there. Meanwhile, however, I took
all the pains in my power to recommend myself to my company, and in the
course of conversation I gave them as good an account as I could of
our German universities, neither denying nor concealing that now and
then we had riots and disturbances. "Oh, we are very unruly here,
too," said one of the clergymen, as he took a hearty draught out of his
pot of beer, and knocked on the table with his hand. The conversation
now became louder, more general, and a little confused. … At last,
when morning drew near, Mr. Maud suddenly exclaimed, "D-n me, I must
read prayers this morning at All Souls!" "D-n me" is an abbreviation
of "G-d d-n me," which in England does not seem to mean more mischief
or harm than any of our or their common expletives in conversation,
such as "O gemini!" or "The deuce take me!" … I am almost ashamed
to own, that next morning, when I awoke, I had got so dreadful a
headache from the copious and numerous toasts of my jolly and reverend
friends that I could not possibly get up.

<p>'Upon the whole, which is preferable, the philosophic method of the

less glorious) is certainly safer for the preacher. It is difficult
for a man to make himself ridiculous, who proposes only to deliver
plain sense on a subject he has thoroughly studied. But the instant
he discovers the least pretensions towards the sublime or the pathetic,
there is no medium; we must either admire or laugh; and there are so
many various talents requisite to form the character of an orator that
it is more than probable we shall laugh.'

Parr:—</p>
<p>'I remember Dr. Routh, the old President of Magdalen, telling me of an
interview and conversation between Dr. Johnson and Dr. Parr, in the
course of which the former made use of some expression respecting the
latter, which considerably wounded and offended him. "Sir," he said
to Dr. Johnson, "you know that what you have just said will be known
in four-and-twenty hours over this vast metropolis." Upon which Dr.
Johnson's manner altered, his eye became calm, and he put out his hand,
and said, "Forgive me, Parr, I didn't quite mean it." "But," said the
President, with an amused and amusing look, "<emphasis>I never could get him to
tell me what it was Dr. Johnson had said!</emphasis>" He spoke of seeing Dr.
Johnson going up the steps into University College, dressed, I think,
in a snuff-coloured coat.'</p>

will be tempted to turn Preachers themselves, and think that they have

<p>(Vol. v, p. 63, n. 2.)</p>
<p>In the preface to <emphasis>Poems by George Monck Berkeley</emphasis>, it is recorded
(p. cccxlviii) that when 'Mr. Berkeley entered at the University of
St. Andrews [about 1778], one of the college officers called upon him
to deposit a crown to pay for the windows he might break. Mr. Berkeley
said, that as he should reside in his father's house, it was little
likely he should break any windows, having never, that he remembered,
broke one in his life. He was assured that he <emphasis>would</emphasis> do it at St.
Andrews. On the rising of the session several of the students said, "Now
for the windows. Come, it is time to set off, let us sally forth!"
Mr. Berkeley, being called upon, enquired what was to be done? They
replied, "Why, to break every window in college." "For what reason?"
"Oh! no reason; but that it has always been done from time immemorial."'
The Editor goes on to say that Mr. Berkeley prevailed on them to give
up the practice. How poor some of the students were is shown by the
following anecdote, told by the College Porter, who had to collect the
crowns. 'I am just come,' he said, 'from a poor student indeed. I went
for the window <emphasis>croon</emphasis>; he cried, begged, and prayed not to pay it,
saying, "he brought but a croon to keep him all the session, and he
had spent sixpence of it; so I have got only four and sixpence."' His
father, a labourer, who owned three cows, 'had sold one to dress his
son for the University, and put the lamented croon in his pocket to
purchase coals. All the lower students study by fire-light. He had
brought with him a large tub of oatmeal and a pot of salted butter, on
which he was to subsist from Oct. 20 until May 20.' Berkeley raised
'a very noble subscription' for the poor fellow.</p>
<p>In another passage (p. cxcviii) it is recorded that Berkeley 'boasted to
his father, "Well, Sir, idle as you may think me, I never have once
bowed at any Professor's Lecture." An explanation being requested of
the word <emphasis>bowing</emphasis>, it was thus given: "Why, if any poor fellow has
been a little idle, and is not prepared to speak when called upon by
the Professor, he gets up and makes a respectful-bow, and sits down
again."' Berkeley was a grandson of Bishop Berkeley.</p>

distinguished by lively fancy or profound reflection; and even in his
own country, at the end of a few years, his name and writings are almost
obliterated. But his philosophy had been formed in the school of Locke,
his divinity in that of Limborch and Le Clerc; in a long and laborious
life several generations of pupils were taught to think and even to
write; his lessons rescued the Academy of Lausanne from Calvinistic
prejudice; and he had the rare merit of diffusing a more liberal spirit
among the clergy and people of the Pays de Vaud.'

in the proper place, that in the first edition the leaf containing pages
167, 168, was really cancelled. In my own copy I noticed between pages 168
and 169 a narrow projecting slip of paper. I found the same in the copy
in the British Museum. Mr. Horace Hart, the printer to the University,
who has kindly examined my copy, informs me that the leaf was cancelled
after the sheets had been stitched together. It was cut out, but an edge
was left to which the new one was attached by paste. The leaf thus
treated begins with the words 'talked with very high respect' (<emphasis>ante</emphasis>,

that he was at a loss how to style the  principal person who figured
in it. "How would you style him, Mr. Boswell?" "I was thinking, Sire,
of calling him the grandson of the unfortunate James the Second." "That
I have no objection  to; my title to the Crown stands on firmer ground

<p>

July 12, 1774:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'At Chatsworth…, Atlas, fifteen hands inch and half.'</p>
<p>Mr. Duppa in a note on this, says: 'A race-horse, which attracted so
much of Dr. Johnson's attention, that he said, "of all the Duke's
possessions I like Atlas best."'</p>
<p>Thomas Holcroft, who in childhood wandered far and wide with his father,
a pedlar, was at Nottingham during the race-week  of the year 1756 or
1757, and saw in its youth the horse which Johnson so much admired in
its old age. He says: 'The great and glorious part which Nottingham held
in the annals of racing this year, arose from the prize of the King's
plate, which was to be contended for by the two horses which everybody
I heard speak considered as undoubtedly the best in England, and perhaps
 equal to any that had ever been known, Childers alone excepted. Their
names were Careless and Atlas…..There was a story in circulation that
Atlas, on account of his size and clumsiness, had been banished to the
cart-breed; till by some accident, either of playfulness or fright,
several of them started together; and his vast advantage in speed
happening to be noticed, he was restored to his blood companions…..Alas
for the men of Nottingham, Careless was conquered. I forget whether it
was at two or three heats, but there was many an empty purse on that
night, and many a sorrowful heart.'

<p>Sir Richard Clough.</p>
<p>(Vol. v, p. 436.)</p>
<p>There is an interesting note on Sir Richard Clough, the founder of Bâch
y Graig, in Professor Rhys's edition of Pennant's <emphasis>Tours in Wales</emphasis>
(vol. ii, p. 137). The Professor writes to me:—</p>
<p>'Sir Richard Clough's wealth was so great that it became a saying of the
people in North Wales that a man who grew very wealthy was or had become
a Clough. This has long been forgotten; but it is still said in Welsh,
in North Wales, that a very rich man is a regular <emphasis>clwch</emphasis>, which is
pronounced with the guttural spirant, which was then (in the 16th
century) sounded in English, just as the English word <emphasis>draught</emphasis> (of
drink) is in Welsh <emphasis>dracht</emphasis> pronounced nearly as if it were German.'</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Evan Evans.</emphasis></p>
<p>(Vol. v, p. 443.)</p>
<p>Evan Evans, who is described as being 'incorrigibly addicted to strong
drink,' was Curate of Llanvair Talyhaern, in Denbighshire, and author
of <emphasis>Some Specimens of the Poetry of Antient Welsh Bards translated into
English</emphasis>. London, R. &amp; J. Dodsley, 1764. My friend Mr. Morfill informs
me that he remembers to have seen it stated in a manuscript note in a
book in the Bodleian, that 'Evan Evans would have written much more if
he had not been so much given up to the bottle.'</p>
<p>Gray thus mentions Evan Evans in a letter to Dr. Wharton, written in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

July, 1760:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>'The Welsh Poets are also coming to light. I have seen a discourse in
MS. about them (by one Mr. Evans, a clergyman) with specimens of their
writings. This is in Latin; and though it don't approach the other
[Macpherson], there are fine scraps among it.'

<p>
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.</p>
<p>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>
<p>START: FULL LICENSE</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</p>
<p>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>
<p>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works</p>
<p>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
<p>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
<p>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>
<p>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.</p>
<p>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>
<p>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
<p>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>
<p>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
<p>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.</p>
<p>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>
<p>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
<p>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>
<p>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
<p>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>
<p>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
