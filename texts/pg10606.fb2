[Motto]: "What would you, gracious figure?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Dr. Greville MacDonald looks on his father's commentary as the "most
important interpretation of the play ever written… It is his intuitive
understanding … rather than learned analysis—of which there is yet
overwhelming evidence—that makes it so splendid."</p>

<p><strong>PREFACE</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>By this edition of HAMLET I hope to help the student of Shakspere to
understand the play—and first of all Hamlet himself, whose spiritual
and moral nature are the real material of the tragedy, to which every
other interest of the play is subservient. But while mainly attempting,
from the words and behaviour Shakspere has given him, to explain the
man, I have cast what light I could upon everything in the play,
including the perplexities arising from extreme condensation of meaning,
figure, and expression.</p>
<p>As it is more than desirable that the student should know when he is
reading the most approximate presentation accessible of what Shakspere
uttered, and when that which modern editors have, with reason good or
bad, often not without presumption, substituted for that which they
received, I have given the text, letter for letter, point for point, of
the First Folio, with the variations of the Second Quarto in the margin
and at the foot of the page.</p>
<p>Of HAMLET there are but two editions of authority, those called the
Second Quarto and the First Folio; but there is another which requires
remark.</p>
<p>In the year 1603 came out the edition known as the First Quarto—clearly
without the poet's permission, and doubtless as much to his displeasure:
the following year he sent out an edition very different, and larger in
the proportion of one hundred pages to sixty-four. Concerning the former
my theory is—though it is not my business to enter into the question
here—that it was printed from Shakspere's sketch for the play, written
with matter crowding upon him too fast for expansion or development, and
intended only for a continuous memorandum of things he would take up and
work out afterwards. It seems almost at times as if he but marked
certain bales of thought so as to find them again, and for the present
threw them aside—knowing that by the marks he could recall the thoughts
they stood for, but not intending thereby to convey them to any reader.
I cannot, with evidence before me, incredible but through the eyes
themselves, of the illimitable scope of printers' blundering, believe
<emphasis>all</emphasis> the confusion, unintelligibility, neglect of grammar,
construction, continuity, sense, attributable to them. In parts it is
more like a series of notes printed with the interlineations horribly
jumbled; while in other parts it looks as if it had been taken down from
the stage by an ear without a brain, and then yet more incorrectly
printed; parts, nevertheless, in which it most differs from the
authorized editions, are yet indubitably from the hand of Shakspere. I
greatly doubt if any ready-writer would have dared publish some of its
chaotic passages as taken down from the stage; nor do I believe the play
was ever presented in anything like such an unfinished state. I rather
think some fellow about the theatre, whether more rogue or fool we will
pay him the thankful tribute not to enquire, chancing upon the crude
embryonic mass in the poet's hand, traitorously pounced upon it, and
betrayed it to the printers—therein serving the poet such an evil turn
as if a sculptor's workman took a mould of the clay figure on which his
master had been but a few days employed, and published casts of it as
the sculptor's work.[1] To us not the less is the <emphasis>corpus delicti</emphasis>
precious—and that unspeakably—for it enables us to see something of
the creational development of the drama, besides serving occasionally to
cast light upon portions of it, yielding hints of the original intention
where the after work has less plainly presented it.</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: Shakspere has in this matter fared even worse than Sir
Thomas Browne, the first edition of whose <emphasis>Religio Medici</emphasis>, nowise
intended for the public, was printed without his knowledge.]</p>
<p>The Second Quarto bears on its title-page, compelled to a recognition of
the former,—'Newly imprinted and enlarged to almost as much againe as
it was, according to the true and perfect Coppie'; and it is in truth a
harmonious world of which the former issue was but the chaos. It is the
drama itself, the concluded work of the master's hand, though yet to be
once more subjected to a little pruning, a little touching, a little
rectifying. But the author would seem to have been as trusting over the
work of the printers, as they were careless of his, and the result is
sometimes pitiable. The blunders are appalling. Both in it and in the
Folio the marginal note again and again suggests itself: 'Here the
compositor was drunk, the press-reader asleep, the devil only aware.'
But though the blunders elbow one another in tumultuous fashion, not
therefore all words and phrases supposed to be such are blunders. The
old superstition of plenary inspiration may, by its reverence for the
very word, have saved many a meaning from the obliteration of a
misunderstanding scribe: in all critical work it seems to me well to
cling to the <emphasis>word</emphasis> until one sinks not merely baffled, but exhausted.</p>
<p>I come now to the relation between the Second Quarto and the Folio.</p>
<p>My theory is—that Shakspere worked upon his own copy of the Second
Quarto, cancelling and adding, and that, after his death, this copy
came, along with original manuscripts, into the hands of his friends the
editors of the Folio, who proceeded to print according to his
alterations.</p>
<p>These friends and editors in their preface profess thus: 'It had bene a
thing, we confesse, worthie to haue bene wished, that the Author
himselfe had liu'd to haue set forth, and ouerseen his owne writings;
But since it hath bin ordain'd otherwise, and he by death departed from
that right, we pray you do not envie his Friends, the office of their
care, and paine, to haue collected &amp; publish'd them, as where (before)
you were abus'd with diuerse stolne, and surreptitious copies, maimed,
and deformed by the frauds and stealthes of iniurious impostors, that
expos'd them: euen those, are now offer'd to your view cur'd, and
perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers, as
he conceiued th[=e]. Who, as he was a happie imitator of Nature, was a
most gentle expresser of it. His mind and hand went together: And what
he thought, he vttered with that easinesse, that wee haue scarse
receiued from him a blot in his papers. But it is not our prouince, who
onely gather his works, and giue them you, to praise him. It is yours
that reade him.'</p>
<p>These are hardly the words of men who would take liberties, and
liberties enormous, after ideas of their own, with the text of a friend
thus honoured. But although they printed with intent altogether
faithful, they did so certainly without any adequate jealousy of the
printers—apparently without a suspicion of how they could blunder. Of
blunders therefore in the Folio also there are many, some through mere
following of blundered print, some in fresh corruption of the same, some
through mistaking of the manuscript corrections, and some probably from
the misprinting of mistakes, so that the corrections themselves are at
times anything but correctly recorded. I assume also that the printers
were not altogether above the mean passion, common to the day-labourers
of Art, from Chaucer's Adam Scrivener down to the present carvers of
marble, for modifying and improving the work of the master. The vain
incapacity of a self-constituted critic will make him regard his poorest
fancy as an emendation; seldom has he the insight of Touchstone to
recognize, or his modesty to acknowledge, that although his own, it is
none the less an ill-favoured thing.</p>
<p>Not such, however, was the spirit of the editors; and all the changes of
importance from the text of the Quarto I receive as Shakspere's own.
With this belief there can be no presumption in saying that they seem to
me not only to trim the parts immediately affected, but to render the
play more harmonious and consistent. It is no presumption to take the
Poet for superior to his work and capable of thinking he could better
it—neither, so believing, to imagine one can see that he has been
successful.</p>
<p>A main argument for the acceptance of the Folio edition as the Poet's
last presentment of his work, lies in the fact that there are passages
in it which are not in the Quarto, and are very plainly from his hand.
If we accept these, what right have we to regard the omission from the
Folio of passages in the Quarto as not proceeding from the same hand?
Had there been omissions only, we might well have doubted; but the
insertions greatly tend to remove the doubt. I cannot even imagine the
arguments which would prevail upon me to accept the latter and refuse
the former. Omission itself shows for a master-hand: see the magnificent
passage omitted, and rightly, by Milton from the opening of his <emphasis>Comus</emphasis>.</p>
<p>'But when a man has published two forms of a thing, may we not judge
between him and himself, and take the reading we like better?'
Assuredly. Take either the Quarto or the Folio; both are Shakspere's.
Take any reading from either, and defend it. But do not mix up the two,
retaining what he omits along with what he inserts, and print them so.
This is what the editors do—and the thing is not Shakspere's. With
homage like this, no artist could be other than indignant. It is well to
show every difference, even to one of spelling where it might indicate
possibly a different word, but there ought to be no mingling of
differences. If I prefer the reading of the Quarto to that of the Folio,
as may sometimes well happen where blunders so abound, I say I
<emphasis>prefer</emphasis>—I do not dare to substitute. My student shall owe nothing of
his text to any but the editors of the Folio, John Heminge and Henrie
Condell.</p>
<p>I desire to take him with me. I intend a continuous, but ever-varying,
while one-ended lesson. We shall follow the play step by step, avoiding
almost nothing that suggests difficulty, and noting everything that
seems to throw light on the character of a person of the drama. The
pointing I consider a matter to be dealt with as any one pleases—for
the sake of sense, of more sense, of better sense, as much as if the
text were a Greek manuscript without any division of words. This
position I need not argue with anyone who has given but a cursory glance
to the original page, or knows anything of printers' pointing. I hold
hard by the word, for that is, or may be, grain: the pointing as we have
it is merest chaff, and more likely to be wrong than right. Here also,
however, I change nothing in the text, only suggest in the notes. Nor do
I remark on any of the pointing where all that is required is the
attention of the student.</p>
<p>Doubtless many will consider not a few of the notes unnecessary. But
what may be unnecessary to one, may be welcome to another, and it is
impossible to tell what a student may or may not know. At the same time
those form a large class who imagine they know a thing when they do not
understand it enough to see there is a difficulty in it: to such, an
attempt at explanation must of course seem foolish.</p>
<p>A <emphasis>number</emphasis> in the margin refers to a passage of the play or in the
notes, and is the number of the page where the passage is to be found.
If the student finds, for instance, against a certain line upon page 8,
the number 12, and turns to page 12, he will there find the number 8
against a certain line: the two lines or passages are to be compared,
and will be found in some way parallel, or mutually explanatory.</p>
<p>Wherever I refer to the Quarto, I intend the 2nd Quarto—that is
Shakspere's own authorized edition, published in his life-time. Where
occasionally I refer to the surreptitious edition, the mere inchoation
of the drama, I call it, as it is, the <emphasis>1st Quarto</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Any word or phrase or stage-direction in the 2nd Quarto differing from
that in the Folio, is placed on the margin in a line with the other:
choice between them I generally leave to my student. Omissions are
mainly given as footnotes. Each edition does something to correct the
errors of the other.</p>
<p>I beg my companion on this journey to let Hamlet reveal himself in the
play, to observe him as he assumes individuality by the concretion of
characteristics. I warn him that any popular notion concerning him which
he may bring with him, will be only obstructive to a perception of the
true idea of the grandest of all Shakspere's presentations.</p>
<p>It will amuse this and that man to remark how often I speak of Hamlet as
if he were a real man and not the invention of Shakspere—for indeed the
Hamlet of the old story is no more that of Shakspere than a lump of coal
is a diamond; but I imagine, if he tried the thing himself, he would
find it hardly possible to avoid so speaking, and at the same time say
what he had to say.</p>
<p>I give hearty thanks to the press-reader, a gentleman whose name I do
not know, not only for keen watchfulness over the printing-difficulties
of the book, but for saving me from several blunders in derivation.</p>

<p>[Transcriber's Note: In the paper original, each left-facing page
contained the text of the play, with sidenotes and footnote references,
and the corresponding right-facing page contained the footnotes
themselves and additional commentary. In this electronic text, the
play-text pages are numbered (contrary to custom in electronic texts),
to allow use of the cross-references provided in the sidenotes and
footnotes. In the play text, sidenotes towards the left of the page are
those marginal cross-references described earlier, and sidenotes toward
the right of the page are the differences noted a few paragraphs later.]</p>

smote his loaded pole-axe on the ice. There is some uncertainty about
the word <emphasis>sledded</emphasis> or <emphasis>sleaded</emphasis> (which latter suggests <emphasis>lead</emphasis>), but we
have the word <emphasis>sledge</emphasis> and <emphasis>sledge-hammer</emphasis>, the smith's heaviest, and
the phrase, 'a sledging blow.' The quarrel on the occasion referred to
rather seems with the Norwegians (See Schmidt's <emphasis>Shakespeare-Lexicon:
Sledded</emphasis>.) than with the Poles; and there would be no doubt as to the
latter interpretation being the right one, were it not that <emphasis>the
Polacke</emphasis>, for the Pole, or nation of the Poles, does occur in the play.
That is, however, no reason why the Dane should not have carried a
pole-axe, or caught one from the hand of an attendant. In both our
authorities, and in the <emphasis>1st Q</emphasis>. also, the word is <emphasis>pollax</emphasis>—as in
Chaucer's <emphasis>Knights Tale</emphasis>: 'No maner schot, ne pollax, ne schort
knyf,'—in the <emphasis>Folio</emphasis> alone with a capital; whereas not once in the
play is the similar word that stands for the Poles used in the plural.
In the <emphasis>2nd Quarto</emphasis> there is <emphasis>Pollacke</emphasis> three times, <emphasis>Pollack</emphasis> once,
<emphasis>Pole</emphasis> once; in the <emphasis>1st Quarto</emphasis>, <emphasis>Polacke</emphasis> twice; in the <emphasis>Folio</emphasis>,
<emphasis>Poleak</emphasis> twice, <emphasis>Polake</emphasis> once. The Poet seems to have avoided the plural
form.]</p>

within him—a something different from woe, far beyond it and worse,

is, comes out the moment he is left by himself.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 2: A soliloquy is as the drawing called a section of a thing:
it shows the inside of the man. Soliloquy is only rare, not unnatural,
and in art serves to reveal more of nature. In the drama it is the
lifting of a veil through which dialogue passes. The scene is for the
moment shifted into the lonely spiritual world, and here we begin to
know Hamlet. Such is his wretchedness, both in mind and circumstance,
that he could well wish to vanish from the world. The suggestion of
suicide, however, he dismisses at once—with a momentary regret, it is
true—but he dismisses it—as against the will of God to whom he appeals
in his misery. The cause of his misery is now made plain to us—his
trouble that passes show, deprives life of its interest, and renders the
world a disgust to him. There is no lamentation over his father's death,
so dwelt upon by the king; for loving grief does not crush. Far less
could his uncle's sharp practice, in scheming for his own election
during Hamlet's absence, have wrought in a philosopher like him such an
effect. The one makes him sorrowful, the other might well annoy him, but
neither could render him unhappy: his misery lies at his mother's door;
it is her conduct that has put out the light of her son's life. She who
had been to him the type of all excellence, she whom his father had
idolized, has within a month of his death married his uncle, and is
living in habitual incest—for as such, a marriage of the kind was then
unanimously regarded. To Hamlet's condition and behaviour, his mother,
her past and her present, is the only and sufficing key. His very idea
of unity had been rent in twain.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: <emphasis>1st Q</emphasis>. 'too much grieu'd and sallied flesh.' <emphasis>Sallied</emphasis>,

Hamlet's mood.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 12: As many of Polonius' aphorismic utterances as are given in
the 1st Quarto have there inverted commas; but whether intended as
gleanings from books or as fruits of experience, the light they throw on
the character of him who speaks them is the same: they show it
altogether selfish. He is a man of the world, wise in his generation,
his principles the best of their bad sort. Of these his son is a fit
recipient and retailer, passing on to his sister their father's grand
doctrine of self-protection. But, wise in maxim, Polonius is foolish in

<p>[Footnote 9: <emphasis>1st Q</emphasis>. 'generall chiefe.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: No doubt the omission of <emphasis>of a</emphasis> gives the right number of
syllables to the verse, and makes room for the interpretation which a
dash between <emphasis>generous</emphasis> and <emphasis>chief</emphasis> renders clearer: 'Are most select
and generous—chief in that,'—'are most choice and well-bred—chief,
indeed—at the head or top, in the matter of dress.' But without
<emphasis>necessity</emphasis> or <emphasis>authority</emphasis>—one of the two, I would not throw away a
word; and suggest therefore that Shakspere had here the French idiom <emphasis>de
son chef</emphasis> in his mind, and qualifies the noun in it with adjectives of
his own. The Academy Dictionary gives <emphasis>de son propre mouvement</emphasis> as one
interpretation of the phrase. The meaning would be, 'they are of a most
choice and developed instinct in dress.' <emphasis>Cheff</emphasis> or <emphasis>chief</emphasis> suggests the
upper third of the heraldic shield, but I cannot persuade the suggestion
to further development. The hypercatalectic syllables <emphasis>of a</emphasis>, swiftly
spoken, matter little to the verse, especially as it is <emphasis>dramatic</emphasis>.]</p>

German <emphasis>zu</emphasis> intensive) is a recognized English word; it means <emphasis>to shake
to pieces</emphasis>. The construction of the passage is, 'What may this mean,
that thou revisitest thus the glimpses of the moon, and that we so
horridly to-shake our disposition?' So in <emphasis>The Merry Wives</emphasis>,</p>
<p>    And fairy-like to-pinch the unclean knight.</p>
<p>'our disposition': our <emphasis>cosmic structure</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: 'with thoughts that are too much for them, and as an
earthquake to them.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: Like all true souls, Hamlet wants to know what he is <emphasis>to
do</emphasis>. He looks out for the action required of him.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: Note here Hamlet's mood—dominated by his faith. His life
in this world his mother has ruined; he does not care for it a pin: he
is not the less confident of a nature that is immortal. In virtue of
this belief in life, he is indifferent to the form of it. When, later in
the play, he seems to fear death, it is death the consequence of an
action of whose rightness he is not convinced.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 4: The word <emphasis>artery</emphasis>, invariably substituted by the editors,
is without authority. In the first Quarto, the word is <emphasis>Artiue</emphasis>; in the
second (see margin) <emphasis>arture</emphasis>. This latter I take to be the right
one—corrupted into <emphasis>Artire</emphasis> in the Folio. It seems to have troubled the
printers, and possibly the editors. The third Q. has followed the
second; the fourth has <emphasis>artyre</emphasis>; the fifth Q. and the fourth F. have
<emphasis>attire</emphasis>; the second and third Folios follow the first. Not until the
sixth Q. does <emphasis>artery</emphasis> appear. See <emphasis>Cambridge Shakespeare. Arture</emphasis> was
to all concerned, and to the language itself, a new word. That <emphasis>artery</emphasis>
was not Shakspere's intention might be concluded from its unfitness:
what propriety could there be in <emphasis>making an artery hardy</emphasis>? The sole,
imperfect justification I was able to think of for such use of the word
arose from the fact that, before the discovery of the circulation of the
blood (published in 1628), it was believed that the arteries (found
empty after death) served for the movements of the animal spirits: this
might vaguely <emphasis>associate</emphasis> the arteries with <emphasis>courage</emphasis>. But the sight of
the word <emphasis>arture</emphasis> in the second Quarto at once relieved me.</p>
<p>I do not know if a list has ever been gathered of the words <emphasis>made</emphasis> by
Shakspere: here is one of them—<emphasis>arture</emphasis>, from the same root as <emphasis>artus,
a joint—arcere, to hold together</emphasis>, adjective <emphasis>arctus, tight. Arture</emphasis>,
then, stands for <emphasis>juncture</emphasis>. This perfectly fits. In terror the weakest
parts are the joints, for their <emphasis>artures</emphasis> are not <emphasis>hardy</emphasis>. 'And you, my
sinews, … bear me stiffly up.' 55, 56.</p>
<p>Since writing as above, a friend informs me that <emphasis>arture</emphasis> is the exact
equivalent of the [Greek: haphae] of Colossians ii. 19, as interpreted
by Bishop Lightfoot—'the relation between contiguous limbs, not the
parts of the limbs themselves in the neighbourhood of contact,'—for
which relation 'there is no word in our language in common use.']</p>

<p>[Footnote 6: It may well seem odd that Hamlet should be represented as,
at such a moment, making a note in his tablets; but without further
allusion to the student-habit, I would remark that, in cases where
strongest passion is roused, the intellect has yet sometimes an
automatic trick of working independently. For instance from Shakspere,
see Constance in <emphasis>King John</emphasis>—how, in her agony over the loss of her
son, both her fancy, playing with words, and her imagination, playing
with forms, are busy.</p>
<p>Note the glimpse of Hamlet's character here given: he had been something
of an optimist; at least had known villainy only from books; at thirty
years of age it is to him a discovery that a man may smile and be a
villain! Then think of the shock of such discoveries as are here forced
upon him! Villainy is no longer a mere idea, but a fact! and of all
villainous deeds those of his own mother and uncle are the worst! But
note also his honesty, his justice to humanity, his philosophic
temperament, in the qualification he sets to the memorandum, '—at least
in Denmark!']</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: 'my word,'—the word he has to keep in mind; his cue.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: Should not the actor here make a pause, with hand uplifted,
as taking a solemn though silent oath?]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: —as if calling to a hawk.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: Here comes the test of the actor's <emphasis>possible</emphasis>: here Hamlet
himself begins to act, and will at once assume a <emphasis>rôle</emphasis>, ere yet he well
knows what it must be. One thing only is clear to him—that the
communication of the Ghost is not a thing to be shared—that he must
keep it with all his power of secrecy: the honour both of father and of
mother is at stake. In order to do so, he must begin by putting on
himself a cloak of darkness, and hiding his feelings—first of all the
present agitation which threatens to overpower him. His immediate
impulse or instinctive motion is to force an air, and throw a veil of
grimmest humour over the occurrence. The agitation of the horror at his
heart, ever working and constantly repressed, shows through the veil,
and gives an excited uncertainty to his words, and a wild vacillation to
his manner and behaviour.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: He feels his honour touched.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: The Ghost's interference heightens Hamlet's agitation. If
he does not talk, laugh, jest, it will overcome him. Also he must not
show that he believes it his father's ghost: that must be kept to
himself—for the present at least. He shows it therefore no
respect—treats the whole thing humorously, so avoiding, or at least
parrying question. It is all he can do to keep the mastery of himself,
dodging horror with half-forced, half-hysterical laughter. Yet is he all
the time intellectually on the alert. See how, instantly active, he
makes use of the voice from beneath to enforce his requisition of
silence. Very speedily too he grows quiet: a glimmer of light as to the
course of action necessary to him has begun to break upon him: it breaks
from his own wild and disjointed behaviour in the attempt to hide the
conflict of his feelings—which suggests to him the idea of shrouding
himself, as did David at the court of the Philistines, in the cloak of
madness: thereby protected from the full force of what suspicion any
absorption of manner or outburst of feeling must occasion, he may win
time to lay his plans. Note how, in the midst of his horror, he is yet
able to think, plan, resolve.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: <emphasis>1st Q. 'The Gost under the stage.'</emphasis>]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: While Hamlet seems to take it so coolly, the others have
fled in terror from the spot. He goes to them. Their fear must be what,
on the two occasions after, makes him shift to another place when the
Ghost speaks.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 6: In the <emphasis>Quarto</emphasis> this and the next line are transposed.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: What idea is involved as the cause of the Ghost's thus
interfering?—That he too sees what difficulties must encompass the
carrying out of his behest, and what absolute secrecy is thereto
essential.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: This idea, hardly yet a resolve, he afterwards carries out
so well, that he deceives not only king and queen and court, but the
most of his critics ever since: to this day they believe him mad. Such
must have studied in the play a phantom of their own misconception, and
can never have seen the Hamlet of Shakspere. Thus prejudiced, they
mistake also the effects of moral and spiritual perturbation and misery
for further sign of intellectual disorder—even for proof of moral
weakness, placing them in the same category with the symptoms of the
insanity which he simulates, and by which they are deluded.]</p>

<p><strong>SUMMARY OF ACT I.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This much of Hamlet we have now learned: he is a thoughtful man, a
genuine student, little acquainted with the world save through books,
and a lover of his kind. His university life at Wittenberg is suddenly
interrupted by a call to the funeral of his father, whom he dearly loves
and honours. Ere he reaches Denmark, his uncle Claudius has contrived,
in an election (202, 250, 272) probably hastened and secretly
influenced, to gain the voice of the representatives at least of the
people, and ascend the throne. Hence his position must have been an
irksome one from the first; but, within a month of his father's death,
his mother's marriage with his uncle—a relation universally regarded as
incestuous—plunges him in the deepest misery. The play introduces him
at the first court held after the wedding. He is attired in the mourning
of his father's funeral, which he had not laid aside for the wedding.
His aspect is of absolute dejection, and he appears in a company for
which he is so unfit only for the sake of desiring permission to leave
the court, and go back to his studies at Wittenberg.[A] Left to himself,
he breaks out in agonized and indignant lamentation over his mother's
conduct, dwelling mainly on her disregard of his father's memory. Her
conduct and his partial discovery of her character, is the sole cause of
his misery. In such his mood, Horatio, a fellow-student, brings him word
that his father's spirit walks at night. He watches for the Ghost, and
receives from him a frightful report of his present condition, into
which, he tells him, he was cast by the murderous hand of his brother,
with whom his wife had been guilty of adultery. He enjoins him to put a
stop to the crime in which they are now living, by taking vengeance on
his uncle. Uncertain at the moment how to act, and dreading the
consequences of rousing suspicion by the perturbation which he could not
but betray, he grasps at the sudden idea of affecting madness. We have
learned also Hamlet's relation to Ophelia, the daughter of the selfish,
prating, busy Polonius, who, with his son Laertes, is destined to work
out the earthly fate of Hamlet. Of Laertes, as yet, we only know that he
prates like his father, is self-confident, and was educated at Paris,
whither he has returned. Of Ophelia we know nothing but that she is
gentle, and that she is fond of Hamlet, whose attentions she has
encouraged, but with whom, upon her father's severe remonstrance, she is
ready, outwardly at least, to break.</p>

necessity which must proclaim her ignominy. Let the student do his best
to realize the condition of Hamlet's heart and mind in relation to his
mother.]</p>

<p>Between this act and the former, sufficient time has passed to allow the
ambassadors to go to Norway and return: 74. See 138, and what Hamlet
says of the time since his father's death, 24, by which together the
interval <emphasis>seems</emphasis> indicated as about two months, though surely so much
time was not necessary.</p>
<p>Cause and effect <emphasis>must</emphasis> be truly presented; time and space are mere
accidents, and of small consequence in the drama, whose very idea is
compression for the sake of presentation. All that is necessary in
regard to time is, that, either by the act-pause, or the intervention of
a fresh scene, the passing of it should be indicated.</p>
<p>This second act occupies the forenoon of one day.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 3: The father has no confidence in the son, and rightly, for
both are unworthy: he turns on him the cunning of the courtier, and
sends a spy on his behaviour. The looseness of his own principles comes
out very clear in his anxieties about his son; and, having learned the
ideas of the father as to what becomes a gentleman, we are not surprised
to find the son such as he afterwards shows himself. Till the end
approaches, we hear no more of Laertes, nor is more necessary; but
without this scene we should have been unprepared for his vileness.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: <emphasis>Point thus</emphasis>: 'son, come you more nearer; then &amp;c.' The
<emphasis>then</emphasis> here does not stand for <emphasis>than</emphasis>, and to change it to <emphasis>than</emphasis> makes
at once a contradiction. The sense is: 'Having put your general
questions first, and been answered to your purpose, then your particular
demands will come in, and be of service; they will reach to the
point—<emphasis>will touch it</emphasis>.' The <emphasis>it</emphasis> is impersonal. After it should come a

<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

And with a looke so pitious in purport,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As if he had been loosed out of hell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: of far reaching mind.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: The word windlaces is explained in the dictionaries as
<emphasis>shifts, subtleties</emphasis>—but apparently on the sole authority of this
passage. There must be a figure in <emphasis>windlesses</emphasis>, as well as in <emphasis>assaies
of Bias</emphasis>, which is a phrase plain enough to bowlers: the trying of other
directions than that of the <emphasis>jack</emphasis>, in the endeavour to come at one with
the law of the bowl's bias. I find <emphasis>wanlass</emphasis> a term in hunting: it had
to do with driving game to a given point—whether in part by getting to
windward of it, I cannot tell. The word may come of the verb wind, from
its meaning '<emphasis>to manage by shifts or expedients</emphasis>': <emphasis>Barclay</emphasis>. As he has
spoken of fishing, could the <emphasis>windlesses</emphasis> refer to any little instrument
such as now used upon a fishing-rod? I do not think it. And how do the
words <emphasis>windlesses</emphasis> and <emphasis>indirections</emphasis> come together? Was a windless some
contrivance for determining how the wind blew? I bethink me that a thin
withered straw is in Scotland called a <emphasis>windlestrae</emphasis>: perhaps such
straws were thrown up to find out 'by indirection' the direction of the
wind.</p>
<p>The press-reader sends me two valuable quotations, through Latham's
edition of Johnson's Dictionary, from Dr. H. Hammond (1605-1660), in
which <emphasis>windlass</emphasis> is used as a verb:—</p>
<p>'A skilful woodsman, by windlassing, presently gets a shoot, which,
without taking a compass, and thereby a commodious stand, he could never
have obtained.'</p>
<p>'She is not so much at leasure as to windlace, or use craft, to satisfy
them.'</p>
<p>To <emphasis>windlace</emphasis> seems then to mean 'to steal along to leeward;' would it
be absurd to suggest that, so-doing, the hunter <emphasis>laces the wind</emphasis>?
Shakspere, with many another, I fancy, speaks of <emphasis>threading the night</emphasis>
or <emphasis>the darkness</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Johnson explains the word in the text as 'A handle by which anything is
turned.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: 'in your selfe.' may mean either 'through the insight
afforded by your own feelings'; or 'in respect of yourself,' 'toward
yourself.' I do not know which is intended.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: 1st Q. 'And bid him'.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: loose; <emphasis>undone</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: His stockings, slipped down in wrinkles round his ankles,
suggested the rings of <emphasis>gyves</emphasis> or fetters. The verb <emphasis>gyve</emphasis>, of which the
passive participle is here used, is rarer.]</p>

And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: She would be glad her father should think so.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: The detailed description of Hamlet and his behaviour that
follows, must be introduced in order that the side mirror of narrative
may aid the front mirror of drama, and between them be given a true
notion of his condition both mental and bodily. Although weeks have
passed since his interview with the Ghost, he is still haunted with the
memory of it, still broods over its horrible revelation. That he had,
probably soon, begun to feel far from certain of the truth of the
apparition, could not make the thoughts and questions it had awaked,
cease tormenting his whole being. The stifling smoke of his mother's
conduct had in his mind burst into loathsome flame, and through her he
has all but lost his faith in humanity. To know his uncle a villain, was
to know his uncle a villain; to know his mother false, was to doubt
women, doubt the whole world.</p>
<p>In the meantime Ophelia, in obedience to her father, and evidently
without reason assigned, has broken off communication with him: he reads
her behaviour by the lurid light of his mother's. She too is false! she
too is heartless! he can look to her for no help! She has turned against
him to curry favour with his mother and his uncle!</p>
<p>Can she be such as his mother! Why should she not be? His mother had
seemed as good! He would give his life to know her honest and pure.
Might he but believe her what he had believed her, he would yet have a
hiding-place from the wind, a covert from the tempest! If he could but
know the truth! Alone with her once more but for a moment, he would read
her very soul by the might of his! He must see her! He would see her! In
the agony of a doubt upon which seemed to hang the bliss or bale of his
being, yet not altogether unintimidated by a sense of his intrusion, he
walks into the house of Polonius, and into the chamber of Ophelia.</p>
<p>Ever since the night of the apparition, the court, from the behaviour
assumed by Hamlet, has believed his mind affected; and when he enters
her room, Ophelia, though such is the insight of love that she is able
to read in the face of the son the father's purgatorial sufferings, the
picture of one 'loosed out of hell, to speak of horrors,' attributes all
the strangeness of his appearance and demeanour, such as she describes
them to her father, to that supposed fact. But there is, in truth, as
little of affected as of actual madness in his behaviour in her
presence. When he comes before her pale and trembling, speechless and
with staring eyes, it is with no simulated insanity, but in the agonized
hope, scarce distinguishable from despair, of finding, in the testimony
of her visible presence, an assurance that the doubts ever tearing his
spirit and sickening his brain, are but the offspring of his phantasy.
There she sits!—and there he stands, vainly endeavouring through her
eyes to read her soul! for, alas,</p>
<p>                    there's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face!</p>
<p>—until at length, finding himself utterly baffled, but unable, save by
the removal of his person, to take his eyes from her face, he retires
speechless as he came. Such is the man whom we are now to see wandering
about the halls and corridors of the great castle-palace.</p>
<p>He may by this time have begun to doubt even the reality of the sight he
had seen. The moment the pressure of a marvellous presence is removed,
it is in the nature of man the same moment to begin to doubt; and
instead of having any reason to wish the apparition a true one, he had
every reason to desire to believe it an illusion or a lying spirit.
Great were his excuse even if he forced likelihoods, and suborned
witnesses in the court of his own judgment. To conclude it false was to
think his father in heaven, and his mother not an adulteress, not a
murderess! At once to kill his uncle would be to seal these horrible
things irrevocable, indisputable facts. Strongest reasons he had for not
taking immediate action in vengeance; but no smallest incapacity for
action had share in his delay. The Poet takes recurrent pains, as if he
foresaw hasty conclusions, to show his hero a man of promptitude, with
this truest fitness for action, that he would not make unlawful haste.
Without sufficing assurance, he would have no part in the fate either of
the uncle he disliked or the mother he loved.]</p>

excessive condensation. Expanded, the clause would be like this: 'which,
being kept close, might move more grief by the hiding of love, than to
utter love might move hate:' the grief in the one case might be greater
than the hate in the other would be. It verges on confusion, and may not
be as Shakspere wrote it, though it is like his way.</p>

<p>Ladies, we are informed, wore a small pocket in front of the

cast the passage away. Hamlet <emphasis>addresses</emphasis> his letter, not to Ophelia's
pocket, but to Ophelia herself, at her house—that is, in the palace of
her bosom, excellent in whiteness. In like manner, signing himself, he
makes mention of his body as a machine of which he has the use for a
time. So earnest is Hamlet that when he makes love, he is the more a
philosopher. But he is more than a philosopher: he is a man of the
Universe, not a man of this world only.</p>
<p>We must not allow the fashion of the time in which the play was written,
to cause doubt as to the genuine heartiness of Hamlet's love-making.]</p>

He has a great dislike to the selfish, time-serving courtier, who, like
his mother, has forsaken the memory of his father—and a great distrust
of him as well. The two men are moral antipodes. Each is given to
moralizing—but compare their reflections: those of Polonius reveal a
lover of himself, those of Hamlet a lover of his kind; Polonius is
interested in success; Hamlet in humanity.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 10: When the passion for emendation takes possession of a man,
his opportunities are endless—so many seeming emendations offer
themselves which are in themselves not bad, letters and words affording
as much play as the keys of a piano. 'Being a god kissing carrion,' is
in itself good enough; but Shakspere meant what stands in both Quarto
and Folio: <emphasis>the dead dog being a carrion good at kissing</emphasis>. The arbitrary
changes of the editors are amazing.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: He cannot help his mind constantly turning upon women; and
if his thoughts of them are often cruelly false, it is not Hamlet but
his mother who is to blame: her conduct has hurled him from the peak of
optimism into the bottomless pool of pessimistic doubt, above the foul
waters of which he keeps struggling to lift his head.]</p>

<p>[Footnote A: <emphasis>In the Quarto, the speech ends thus</emphasis>:—I will leaue him

<p>[Footnote 1: From 'And sodainely' <emphasis>to</emphasis> 'betweene him,' <emphasis>not in Quarto</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: It is well here to recall the modes of the word <emphasis>leave</emphasis>:
'<emphasis>Give me leave</emphasis>,' Polonius says with proper politeness to the king and
queen when he wants <emphasis>them</emphasis> to go—that is, 'Grant me your <emphasis>departure</emphasis>';
but he would, going himself, <emphasis>take</emphasis> his leave, his departure, <emphasis>of</emphasis> or
<emphasis>from</emphasis> them—by their permission to go. Hamlet means, 'You cannot take
from me anything I will more willingly part with than your leave, or, my
permission to you to go.' 85, 203. See the play on the two meanings of
the word in <emphasis>Twelfth Night</emphasis>, act ii. sc. 4:</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Duke</emphasis>. Give me now leave to leave thee;</p>
<p>though I suspect it ought to be—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Duke</emphasis>. Give me now leave.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Clown</emphasis>. To leave thee!—Now, the melancholy &amp;c.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: It is a relief to him to speak the truth under the cloak of
madness—ravingly. He has no one to whom to open his heart: what lies
there he feels too terrible for even the eye of Horatio. He has not
apparently told him as yet more than the tale of his father's murder.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: <emphasis>Above, in Quarto</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: In this and all like utterances of Hamlet, we see what worm
it is that lies gnawing at his heart.]</p>

<p>newes is not true.[1] [2] Let me question more in particular:
what haue you my good friends, deserued
at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to
Prison hither?</p>
<p><emphasis>Guil</emphasis>. Prison, my Lord?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. Denmark's a Prison.</p>
<p><emphasis>Rosin</emphasis>. Then is the World one.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. A goodly one, in which there are many
Confines, Wards, and Dungeons; <emphasis>Denmarke</emphasis> being
one o'th'worst.</p>
<p><emphasis>Rosin</emphasis>. We thinke not so my Lord.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. Why then 'tis none to you; for there is
nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it
so[3]: to me it is a prison.</p>
<p><emphasis>Rosin</emphasis>. Why then your Ambition makes it one:
'tis too narrow for your minde.[4]</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell,
and count my selfe a King of infinite space; were
it not that I haue bad dreames.</p>
<p><emphasis>Guil</emphasis>. Which dreames indeed are Ambition:
for the very substance[5] of the Ambitious, is meerely
the shadow of a Dreame.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. A dreame it selfe is but a shadow.</p>
<p><emphasis>Rosin</emphasis>. Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry
and light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. Then are our Beggers bodies; and our</p>

<p><emphasis>Both</emphasis>. Wee'l wait vpon you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. No such matter.[8] I will not sort you
with the rest of my seruants: for to speake to you
like an honest man: I am most dreadfully attended;[9]
but in the beaten way of friendship,[10]              [Sidenote: But in]</p>
<p>What make you at <emphasis>Elsonower</emphasis>?</p>

themselves. His eye is sharper because his heart is sorer since he left
Wittenberg. He proceeds to examine them.]</p>

with 'dreadfully attended,' is not in the <emphasis>Quarto</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Who inserted in the Folio this and other passages? Was it or was it not
Shakspere? Beyond a doubt they are Shakspere's all. Then who omitted
those omitted? Was Shakspere incapable of refusing any of his own work?
Or would these editors, who profess to have all opportunity, and who,
belonging to the theatre, must have had the best of opportunities, have
desired or dared to omit what far more painstaking editors have since
presumed, though out of reverence, to restore?]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: 'but it is thinking that makes it so:']</p>

<p>[Footnote 6: <emphasis>foi</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: Does he choose beggars as the representatives of substance
because they lack ambition—that being shadow? Or does he take them as
the shadows of humanity, that, following Rosincrance, he may get their
shadows, the shadows therefore of shadows, to parallel <emphasis>monarchs</emphasis> and
<emphasis>heroes</emphasis>? But he is not satisfied with his own analogue—therefore will
to the court, where good logic is not wanted—where indeed he knows a
hellish lack of reason.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 9: 'I have very bad servants.' Perhaps he judges his servants
spies upon him. Or might he mean that he was <emphasis>haunted with bad

madness—suggesting imaginary followers?]</p>

                                [Sidenote: Any thing but to'th purpose:]
you were sent for; and there is a kinde confession

strong, that, in 1600, the Privy Council issued an order restricting the

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>SUMMARY.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The division between the second and third acts is by common consent
placed here. The third act occupies the afternoon, evening, and night of
the same day with the second.</p>
<p>This soliloquy is Hamlet's first, and perhaps we may find it correct to
say <emphasis>only</emphasis> outbreak of self-accusation. He charges himself with lack of
feeling, spirit, and courage, in that he has not yet taken vengeance on
his uncle. But unless we are prepared to accept and justify to the full
his own hardest words against himself, and grant him a muddy-mettled,
pigeon-livered rascal, we must examine and understand him, so as to
account for his conduct better than he could himself. If we allow that
perhaps he accuses himself too much, we may find on reflection that he
accuses himself altogether wrongfully. If a man is content to think the
worst of Hamlet, I care to hold no argument with that man.</p>
<p>We must not look for <emphasis>expressed</emphasis> logical sequence in a soliloquy, which
is a vocal mind. The mind is seldom conscious of the links or
transitions of a yet perfectly logical process developed in it. This
remark, however, is more necessary in regard to the famous soliloquy to
follow.</p>
<p>In Hamlet, misery has partly choked even vengeance; and although sure in
his heart that his uncle is guilty, in his brain he is not sure.
Bitterly accusing himself in an access of wretchedness and rage and
credence, he forgets the doubt that has restrained him, with all besides
which he might so well urge in righteous defence, not excuse, of his
delay. But ungenerous criticism has, by all but universal consent,
accepted his own verdict against himself. So in common life there are
thousands on thousands who, upon the sad confession of a man
immeasurably greater than themselves, and showing his greatness in the
humility whose absence makes admission impossible to them, immediately
pounce upon him with vituperation, as if he were one of the vile, and
they infinitely better. Such should be indignant with St. Paul and
say—if he was the chief of sinners, what insolence to lecture <emphasis>them</emphasis>!
and certainly the more justified publican would never by them have been
allowed to touch the robe of the less justified Pharisee. Such critics
surely take little or no pains to understand the object of their
contempt: because Hamlet is troubled and blames himself, they without
hesitation condemn him—and there where he is most commendable. It is
the righteous man who is most ready to accuse himself; the unrighteous
is least ready. Who is able when in deep trouble, rightly to analyze his
feelings? Delay in action is not necessarily abandonment of duty; in
Hamlet's case it is a due recognition of duty, which condemns
precipitancy—and action in the face of doubt, so long as it is nowise
compelled, is precipitancy. The first thing is <emphasis>to be sure</emphasis>: Hamlet has
never been sure; he spies at length a chance of making himself sure; he
seizes upon it; and while his sudden resolve to make use of the players,
like the equally sudden resolve to shroud himself in pretended madness,
manifests him fertile in expedient, the carrying out of both manifests
him right capable and diligent in execution—<emphasis>a man of action in every
true sense of the word</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The self-accusation of Hamlet has its ground in the lapse of weeks
during which nothing has been done towards punishing the king. Suddenly
roused to a keen sense of the fact, he feels as if surely he might have
done something. The first act ends with a burning vow of righteous
vengeance; the second shows him wandering about the palace in
profoundest melancholy—such as makes it more than easy for him to
assume the forms of madness the moment he marks any curious eye bent
upon him. Let him who has never loved and revered a mother, call such
melancholy weakness. He has indeed done nothing towards the fulfilment
of his vow; but the way in which he made the vow, the terms in which he
exacted from his companions their promise of silence, and his scheme for
eluding suspicion, combine to show that from the first he perceived its
fulfilment would be hard, saw the obstacles in his way, and knew it
would require both time and caution. That even in the first rush of his
wrath he should thus be aware of difficulty, indicates moral symmetry;
but the full weight of what lay in his path could appear to him only
upon reflection. Partly in the light of passages yet to come, I will
imagine the further course of his thoughts, which the closing couplet of
the first act shows as having already begun to apale 'the native hue of
resolution.'</p>
<p>'But how shall I take vengeance on my uncle? Shall I publicly accuse
him, or slay him at once? In the one case what answer can I make to his
denial? in the other, what justification can I offer? If I say the
spirit of my father accuses him, what proof can I bring? My companions
only saw the apparition—heard no word from him; and my uncle's party
will assert, with absolute likelihood to the minds of those who do not
know me—and who here knows me but my mother!—that charge is a mere
coinage of jealous disappointment, working upon the melancholy I have
not cared to hide. (174-6.) When I act, it must be to kill him, and to
what misconstruction shall I not expose myself! (272) If the thing must
so be, I must brave all; but I could never present myself thereafter as
successor to the crown of one whom I had first slain and then vilified
on the accusation of an apparition whom no one heard but myself! I must
find <emphasis>proof</emphasis>—such proof as will satisfy others as well as myself. My
immediate duty is <emphasis>evidence</emphasis>, not vengeance.'</p>
<p>We have seen besides, that, when informed of the haunting presence of
the Ghost, he expected the apparition with not a little doubt as to its
authenticity—a doubt which, even when he saw it, did not immediately
vanish: is it any wonder that when the apparition was gone, the doubt
should return? Return it did, in accordance with the reaction which
waits upon all high-strung experience. If he did not believe in the
person who performed it, would any man long believe in any miracle?
Hamlet soon begins to question whether he can with confidence accept the
appearance for that which it appeared and asserted itself to be. He
steps over to the stand-point of his judges, and doubts the only
testimony he has to produce. Far more:—was he not bound in common
humanity, not to say <emphasis>filialness</emphasis>, to doubt it? To doubt the Ghost, was
to doubt a testimony which to accept was to believe his father in
horrible suffering, his uncle a murderer, his mother at least an
adulteress; to kill his uncle was to set his seal to the whole, and,
besides, to bring his mother into frightful suspicion of complicity in
his father's murder. Ought not the faintest shadow of a doubt, assuaging
ever so little the glare of the hell-sun of such crime, to be welcome to
the tortured heart? Wretched wife and woman as his mother had shown
herself, the Ghost would have him think her far worse—perhaps, even
accessory to her husband's murder! For action he <emphasis>must</emphasis> have proof!</p>
<p>At the same time, what every one knew of his mother, coupled now with
the mere idea of the Ghost's accusation, wrought in him such misery,
roused in him so many torturing and unanswerable questions, so blotted
the face of the universe and withered the heart of hope, that he could
not but doubt whether, in such a world of rogues and false women, it was
worth his while to slay one villain out of the swarm.</p>
<p>Ophelia's behaviour to him, in obedience to her father, of which she
gives him no explanation, has added 'the pangs of disprized love,' and
increased his doubts of woman-kind. 120.</p>
<p>But when his imagination, presenting afresh the awful interview, brings
him more immediately under the influence of the apparition and its
behest, he is for the moment delivered both from the stunning effect of
its communication and his doubt of its truth; forgetting then the
considerations that have wrought in him, he accuses himself of
remissness, blames himself grievously for his delay. Soon, however, his
senses resume their influence, and he doubts again. So goes the
mill-round of his thoughts, with the revolving of many wheels.</p>
<p>His whole conscious nature is frightfully shaken: he would be the poor
creature most of his critics would make of him, were it otherwise; it is
because of his greatness that he suffers so terribly, and doubts so
much. A mother's crime is far more paralyzing than a father's murder is
stimulating; and either he has not set himself in thorough earnest to
find the proof he needs, or he has as yet been unable to think of any
serviceable means to the end, when the half real, half simulated emotion
of the Player yet again rouses in him the sense of remissness, leads him
to accuse himself of forgotten obligation and heartlessness, and
simultaneously suggests a device for putting the Ghost and his words to
the test. Instantly he seizes the chance: when a thing has to be done,
and can be done, Hamlet is <emphasis>never</emphasis> wanting—shows himself the very
promptest of men.</p>
<p>In the last passage of this act I do not take it that he is expressing
an idea then first occurring to him: that the whole thing may be a snare
of the devil is a doubt with which during weeks he has been familiar.</p>
<p>The delay through which, in utter failure to comprehend his character,
he has been so miserably misjudged, falls really between the first and
second acts, although it seems in the regard of most readers to underlie
and protract the whole play. Its duration is measured by the journey of
the ambassadors to and from the neighbouring kingdom of Norway.</p>
<p>It is notably odd, by the way, that those who accuse Hamlet of inaction,
are mostly the same who believe his madness a reality! In truth,
however, his affected madness is one of the strongest signs of his
activity, and his delay one of the strongest proofs of his sanity.</p>
<p>This second act, the third act, and a part always given to the fourth,
but which really belongs to the third, occupy in all only one day.</p>

act: doubt as to the facts of the case has been throughout operating to
restrain him; and here first he reveals, perhaps first recognizes its
influence. Subject to change of feeling with the wavering of conviction,
he now for a moment regards his uncertainty as involving unnatural
distrust of a being in whose presence he cannot help <emphasis>feeling</emphasis> him his
father. He was familiar with the lore of the supernatural, and knew the
doubt he expresses to be not without support.—His companions as well
had all been in suspense as to the identity of the apparition with the

<p>[Footnote 2: I allow this to be a general reflection, but surely it
serves to show that <emphasis>conscience</emphasis> must at least be one of Hamlet's
restraints.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: —by way of intercession.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: Note the entire change of mood from that of the last
soliloquy. The right understanding of this soliloquy is indispensable to
the right understanding of Hamlet. But we are terribly trammelled and
hindered, as in the understanding of Hamlet throughout, so here in the
understanding of his meditation, by traditional assumption. I was roused
to think in the right direction concerning it, by the honoured friend
and relative to whom I have feebly acknowledged my obligation by
dedicating to him this book. I could not at first see it as he saw it:
'Think about it, and you will,' he said. I did think, and by
degrees—not very quickly—my prejudgments thinned, faded, and almost
vanished. I trust I see it now as a whole, and in its true relations,
internal and external—its relations to itself, to the play, and to the
Hamlet, of Shakspere.</p>
<p>Neither in its first verse, then, nor in it anywhere else, do I find
even an allusion to suicide. What Hamlet is referring to in the said
first verse, it is not possible with certainty to determine, for it is
but the vanishing ripple of a preceding ocean of thought, from which he
is just stepping out upon the shore of the articulate. He may have been
plunged in some profound depth of the metaphysics of existence, or he
may have been occupied with the one practical question, that of the
slaying of his uncle, which has, now in one form, now in another,
haunted his spirit for weeks. Perhaps, from the message he has just
received, he expects to meet the king, and conscience, confronting
temptation, has been urging the necessity of proof; perhaps a righteous
consideration of consequences, which sometimes have share in the primary
duty, has been making him shrink afresh from the shedding of blood, for
every thoughtful mind recoils from the irrevocable, and that is an awful
form of the irrevocable. But whatever thought, general or special, this
first verse may be dismissing, we come at once thereafter into the light
of a definite question: 'Which is nobler—to endure evil fortune, or to
oppose it <emphasis>à outrance</emphasis>; to bear in passivity, or to resist where
resistance is hopeless—resist to the last—to the death which is its
unavoidable end?'</p>
<p>Then comes a pause, during which he is thinking—we will not say 'too
precisely on the event,' but taking his account with consequences: the
result appears in the uttered conviction that the extreme possible
consequence, death, is a good and not an evil. Throughout, observe, how
here, as always, he generalizes, himself being to himself but the type
of his race.</p>
<p>Then follows another pause, during which he seems prosecuting the
thought, for he has already commenced further remark in similar strain,
when suddenly a new and awful element introduces itself:</p>
<p>                       ….To die—to sleep.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    —To <emphasis>sleep</emphasis>! perchance to <emphasis>dream</emphasis>!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He had been thinking of death only as the passing away of the present
with its troubles; here comes the recollection that death has its own
troubles—its own thoughts, its own consciousness: if it be a sleep, it
has its dreams. '<emphasis>What dreams may come</emphasis>' means, 'the sort of dreams that
may come'; the emphasis is on the <emphasis>what</emphasis>, not on the <emphasis>may</emphasis>; there is no
question whether dreams will come, but there is question of the
character of the dreams. This consideration is what makes calamity so
long-lived! 'For who would bear the multiform ills of life'—he alludes
to his own wrongs, but mingles, in his generalizing way, others of those
most common to humanity, and refers to the special cure for some of his
own which was close to his hand—'who would bear these things if he
could, as I can, make his quietus with a bare bodkin'—that is, by
slaying his enemy—'who would then bear them, but that he fears the
future, and the divine judgment upon his life and actions—that
conscience makes a coward of him!'[14]</p>
<p>To run, not the risk of death, but the risks that attend upon and follow
death, Hamlet must be certain of what he is about; he must be sure it is
a right thing he does, or he will leave it undone. Compare his speech,
250, 'Does it not, &amp;c.':—by the time he speaks this speech, he has had
perfect proof, and asserts the righteousness of taking vengeance in
almost an agony of appeal to Horatio.</p>
<p>The more continuous and the more formally logical a soliloquy, the less
natural it is. The logic should be all there, but latent; the bones of
it should not show: they do not show here.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: <emphasis>One</emphasis> 'well' <emphasis>only in Q.</emphasis>]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: He does not want to take them back, and so sever even that
weak bond between them. He has not given her up.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: The <emphasis>Q.</emphasis> reading seems best. The perfume of his gifts was
the sweet words with which they were given; those words having lost
their savour, the mere gifts were worth nothing.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: Released from the commands her father had laid upon her,
and emboldened by the queen's approval of more than the old relation
between them, she would timidly draw Hamlet back to the past—to love
and a sound mind.]</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>[Footnote 9: I do not here suppose a noise or movement of the arras, or
think that the talk from this point bears the mark of the madness he
would have assumed on the least suspicion of espial. His distrust of
Ophelia comes from a far deeper source—suspicion of all women, grown
doubtful to him through his mother. Hopeless for her, he would give his
life to know that Ophelia was not like her. Hence the cruel things he
says to her here and elsewhere; they are the brood of a heart haunted
with horrible, alas! too excusable phantoms of distrust. A man wretched
as Hamlet must be forgiven for being rude; it is love suppressed, love
that can neither breathe nor burn, that makes him rude. His horrid
insinuations are a hungry challenge to indignant rejection. He would
sting Ophelia to defence of herself and her sex. But, either from her
love, or from gentleness to his supposed madness, as afterwards in the
play-scene, or from the poverty and weakness of a nature so fathered and
so brothered, she hears, and says nothing. 139.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: Honesty is here figured as a porter,—just after, as a
porter that may be corrupted.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: If the <emphasis>Folio</emphasis> reading is right, <emphasis>commerce</emphasis> means
<emphasis>companionship</emphasis>; if the <emphasis>Quarto</emphasis> reading, then it means <emphasis>intercourse</emphasis>.
Note <emphasis>then</emphasis> constantly for our <emphasis>than</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: I imagine Ophelia here giving Hamlet a loving look—which
hardens him. But I do not think she lays emphasis on <emphasis>your</emphasis>; the word is
here, I take it, used (as so often then) impersonally.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 13: '—proof in you and me: <emphasis>I</emphasis> loved <emphasis>you</emphasis> once, but my
honesty did not translate your beauty into its likeness.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 14: That the Great Judgement was here in Shakspere's thought,
will be plain to those who take light from the corresponding passage in
the <emphasis>1st Quarto</emphasis>. As it makes an excellent specimen of that issue in the
character I am most inclined to attribute to it—that of original sketch
and continuous line of notes, with more or less finished passages in
place among the notes—I will here quote it, recommending it to my
student's attention. If it be what I suggest, it is clear that Shakspere
had not at first altogether determined how he would carry the
soliloquy—what line he was going to follow in it: here hope and fear
contend for the place of motive to patience. The changes from it in the
text are well worth noting: the religion is lessened: the hope
disappears: were they too much of pearls to cast before 'barren
spectators'? The manuscript could never have been meant for any eye but
his own, seeing it was possible to print from it such a chaos—over
which yet broods the presence of the formative spirit of the Poet.</p>

it not the case with every noble nature, that the knowledge of wrong in
another arouses in it the consciousness of its own faults and sins, of
its own evil possibilities? Hurled from the heights of ideal humanity,
Hamlet not only recognizes in himself every evil tendency of his race,
but almost feels himself individually guilty of every transgression.
'God, God, forgive us all!' exclaims the doctor who has just witnessed
the misery of Lady Macbeth, unveiling her guilt.</p>
<p>This whole speech of Hamlet is profoundly sane—looking therefore
altogether insane to the shallow mind, on which the impression of its
insanity is deepened by its coming from him so freely. The common nature
disappointed rails at humanity; Hamlet, his earthly ideal destroyed,
would tear his individual human self to pieces.]</p>

him talk of his friend—why he loves, admires, chooses him. The Poet
here gives us a wide window into Hamlet. So genuine is his respect for
<emphasis>being</emphasis>, so indifferent is he to <emphasis>having</emphasis>, that he does not shrink, in
argument for his own truth, from reminding his friend to his face that,
being a poor man, nothing is to be gained from him—nay, from telling
him that it is through his poverty he has learned to admire him, as a
man of courage, temper, contentment, and independence, with nothing but
his good spirits for an income—a man whose manhood is dominant both
over his senses and over his fortune—a true Stoic. He describes an
ideal man, then clasps the ideal to his bosom as his own, in the person
of his friend. Only a great man could so worship another, choosing him
for such qualities; and hereby Shakspere shows us his Hamlet—a brave,
noble, wise, pure man, beset by circumstances the most adverse
conceivable. That Hamlet had not misapprehended Horatio becomes evident
in the last scene of all. 272.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 2: I take 'my' to be right: 'watch my uncle with the

<p>[Footnote 3: He has then, ere this, taken Horatio into his
confidence—so far at least as the Ghost's communication concerning the
murder.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: a dissyllable: <emphasis>stithy</emphasis>, <emphasis>anvil</emphasis>; Scotch, <emphasis>studdy</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Hamlet's doubt is here very evident: he hopes he may find it a false
ghost: what good man, what good son would not? He has clear cause and
reason—it is his duty to delay. That the cause and reason and duty are
not invariably clear to Hamlet himself—not clear in every mood, is
another thing. Wavering conviction, doubt of evidence, the corollaries
of assurance, the oppression of misery, a sense of the worthlessness of
the world's whole economy—each demanding delay, might yet well, all
together, affect the man's feeling as mere causes of rather than reasons
for hesitation. The conscientiousness of Hamlet stands out the clearer
that, throughout, his dislike to his uncle, predisposing him to believe
any ill of him, is more than evident. By his incompetent or prejudiced
judges, Hamlet's accusations and justifications of himself are equally
placed to the <emphasis>discredit</emphasis> of his account. They seem to think a man could
never accuse himself except he were in the wrong; therefore if ever he
excuses himself, he is the more certainly in the wrong: whatever point
may tell on the other side, it is to be disregarded.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 8: The king asks Hamlet how he <emphasis>fares</emphasis>—that is, how he gets
on; Hamlet pretends to think he has asked him about his diet. His talk
has at once become wild; ere the king enters he has donned his cloak of
madness. Here he confesses to ambition—will favour any notion
concerning himself rather than give ground for suspecting the real state
of his mind and feeling.</p>

<p>[Footnote 7: In <emphasis>1st Quarto</emphasis>, 'contrary.'</p>
<p>Hamlet hints, probing her character—hoping her unable to understand. It
is the festering soreness of his feeling concerning his mother, making
him doubt with the haunting agony of a loathed possibility, that
prompts, urges, forces from him his ugly speeches—nowise to be
justified, only to be largely excused in his sickening consciousness of
his mother's presence. Such pain as Hamlet's, the ferment of subverted
love and reverence, may lightly bear the blame of hideous manners,
seeing, they spring from no wantonness, but from the writhing of
tortured and helpless Purity. Good manners may be as impossible as out
of place in the presence of shameless evil.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: Ophelia bears with him for his own and his madness' sake,
and is less uneasy because of the presence of his mother. To account
<emphasis>satisfactorily</emphasis> for Hamlet's speeches to her, is not easy. The freer
custom of the age, freer to an extent hardly credible in this, will not
<emphasis>satisfy</emphasis> the lovers of Hamlet, although it must have <emphasis>some</emphasis> weight. The
necessity for talking madly, because he is in the presence of his uncle,
and perhaps, to that end, for uttering whatever comes to him, without
pause for choice, might give us another hair's-weight. Also he may be
supposed confident that Ophelia would not understand him, while his
uncle would naturally set such worse than improprieties down to wildest
madness. But I suspect that here as before (123), Shakepere would show
Hamlet's soul full of bitterest, passionate loathing; his mother has
compelled him to think of horrors and women together, so turning their
preciousness into a disgust; and this feeling, his assumed madhess
allows him to indulge and partly relieve by utterance. Could he have
provoked Ophelia to rebuke him with the severity he courted, such rebuke
would have been joy to him. Perhaps yet a small addition of weight to
the scale of his excuse may be found in his excitement about his play,
and the necessity for keeping down that excitement. Suggestion is easier
than judgment.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: 'here's for the jig-maker! he's the right man!' Or perhaps
he is claiming the part as his own: 'I am your only jig-maker!']</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: This needs not be taken for the exact time. The statement
notwithstanding suggests something like two months between the first and
second acts, for in the first, Hamlet says his father has not been dead
two months. 24. We are not bound to take it for more than a rough
approximation; Ophelia would make the best of things for the queen, who
is very kind to her.]</p>

to the older plays by its rimes, while also by its stately and
monotonous movement the play-play is differenced from the play into
which it is introduced, and caused to <emphasis>look</emphasis> intrinsically like a play

it stands off from the surrounding play, slightly elevated both by form

himself with evident apprehension, every now and then glancing about

stirred in Hamlet the fierceness of vengeance. But here afresh comes
out the balanced nature of the man—say rather, the supremacy in him of
reason and will. His dear soul, having once become mistress of his
choice, remains mistress for ever. He <emphasis>could</emphasis> drink hot blood, he

restraint.]</p>

to the spectator of the play: here Claudius confesses not merely guilt

the student that only he, not Hamlet, hears this soliloquy. The

<p>[Footnote 1: In the <emphasis>1st Q.</emphasis> this speech commences with, 'I so, come
forth and worke thy last,' evidently addressed to his sword; afterwards,
having changed his purpose, he says, 'no, get thee vp agen.']</p>

<p>[Footnote 3: <emphasis>grasp</emphasis>. This is the only instance I know of <emphasis>hent</emphasis> as a
noun. The verb <emphasis>to hent, to lay hold of</emphasis>, is not so rare. 'Wait till
thou be aware of a grasp with a more horrid purpose in it.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: —still addressed to his sword.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: Are we to take Hamlet's own presentment of his reasons as
exhaustive? Doubtless to kill him at his prayers, whereupon, after the
notions of the time, he would go to heaven, would be anything but
justice—the murdered man in hell—the murderer in heaven! But it is
easy to suppose Hamlet finding it impossible to slay a man on his
knees—and that from behind: thus in the unseen Presence, he was in
sanctuary, and the avenger might well seek reason or excuse for not
<emphasis>then</emphasis>, not <emphasis>there</emphasis> executing the decree.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: 'waits for me.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: He seems now to have made up his mind, and to await only
fit time and opportunity; but he is yet to receive confirmation strong
as holy writ.</p>
<p>This is the first chance Hamlet has had—within the play—of killing the
king, and any imputation of faulty irresolution therein is simply silly.
It shows the soundness of Hamlet's reason, and the steadiness of his
will, that he refuses to be carried away by passion, or the temptation
of opportunity. The sight of the man on his knees might well start fresh
doubt of his guilt, or even wake the thought of sparing a repentant
sinner. He knows also that in taking vengeance on her husband he could
not avoid compromising his mother. Besides, a man like Hamlet could not
fail to perceive how the killing of his uncle, and in such an attitude,
would look to others.</p>
<p>It may be judged, however, that the reason he gives to himself for not
slaying the king, was only an excuse, that his soul revolted from the
idea of assassination, and was calmed in a measure by the doubt whether
a man could thus pray—in supposed privacy, we must remember—and be a
murderer. Not even yet had he proof <emphasis>positive</emphasis>, absolute, conclusive:
the king might well take offence at the play, even were he innocent; and
in any case Hamlet would desire <emphasis>presentable</emphasis> proof: he had positively
none to show the people in justification of vengeance.</p>
<p>As in excitement a man's moods may be opalescent in their changes, and
as the most contrary feelings may coexist in varying degrees, all might
be in a mind, which I have suggested as present in that of Hamlet.</p>
<p>To have been capable of the kind of action most of his critics would
demand of a man, Hamlet must have been the weakling they imagine him.
When at length, after a righteous delay, partly willed, partly
inevitable, he holds documents in the king's handwriting as proofs of
his treachery—<emphasis>proofs which can be shown</emphasis>—giving him both right and
power over the life of the traitor, then, and only then, is he in cool
blood absolutely satisfied as to his duty—which conviction, working
with opportunity, and that opportunity plainly the last, brings the end;
the righteous deed is done, and done righteously, the doer blameless in
the doing of it. The Poet is not careful of what is called poetic
justice in his play, though therein is no failure; what he is careful of
is personal rightness in the hero of it.]</p>

for action, showing his delay the more admirable. There is here neither
time nor call for delay. Whoever the man behind the arras might be, he
had, by spying upon him in the privacy of his mother's room, forfeited
to Hamlet his right to live; he had heard what he had said to his
mother, and his death was necessary; for, if he left the room, Hamlet's
last chance of fulfilling his vow to the Ghost was gone: if the play had
not sealed, what he had now spoken must seal his doom. But the decree
had in fact already gone forth against his life. 158.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 2: —<emphasis>through the arras</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: Hamlet takes him for, hopes it is the king, and thinks here
to conclude: he is not praying now! and there is not a moment to be
lost, for he has betrayed his presence and called for help. As often as
immediate action is demanded of Hamlet, he is immediate with his
response—never hesitates, never blunders. There is no blunder here:
being where he was, the death of Polonius was necessary now to the death
of the king. Hamlet's resolve is instant, and the act simultaneous with
the resolve. The weak man is sure to be found wanting when immediate
action is necessary; Hamlet never is. Doubtless those who blame him as
dilatory, here blame him as precipitate, for they judge according to
appearance and consequence.</p>
<p>All his delay after this is plainly compelled, although I grant he was
not sorry to have to await such <emphasis>more presentable</emphasis> evidence as at last
he procured, so long as he did not lose the final possibility of
vengeance.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: This is the sole reference in the interview to the murder.
I take it for tentative, and that Hamlet is satisfied by his mother's
utterance, carriage, and expression, that she is innocent of any
knowledge of that crime. Neither does he allude to the adultery: there
is enough in what she cannot deny, and that only which can be remedied
needs be taken up; while to break with the king would open the door of
repentance for all that had preceded.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 10: I cannot help thinking the <emphasis>Quarto</emphasis> reading of this
passage the more intelligible, as well as much the more powerful. We may
imagine a red aurora, by no means a very unusual phenomenon, over the

<p>(<emphasis>thought is sick at the act of the queen</emphasis>)</p>
<p>My difficulties as to the <emphasis>Folio</emphasis> reading are—why the earth should be
so described without immediate contrast with the sky; and—how the earth
could be showing a tristful visage, and the sickness of its thought. I
think, if the Poet indeed made the alterations and they are not mere
blunders, he must have made them hurriedly, and without due attention. I
would not forget, however, that there may be something present but too
good for me to find, which would make the passage plain as it stands.</p>

was then from the first intended that he should not at this point appear
in armour—in which, indeed, the epithet <emphasis>gracious figure</emphasis> could hardly
be applied to him, though it might well enough in one of the costumes in
which Hamlet was accustomed to see him—as this dressing-gown of the
<emphasis>1st Q.</emphasis> A ghost would appear in the costume in which he naturally
imagined himself, and in his wife's room would not show himself clothed
as when walking among the fortifications of the castle. But by the words
lower down (174)—</p>
<p>    My Father in his habite, as he liued,</p>
<p>the Poet indicates, not his dressing-gown, but his usual habit, <emphasis>i.e.</emphasis>

<p>[Footnote 10: —almost the same invocation as when first he saw the
apparition.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: The queen cannot see the Ghost. Her conduct has built such
a wall between her and her husband that I doubt whether, were she a
ghost also, she could see him. Her heart had left him, so they are no
more together in the sphere of mutual vision. Neither does the Ghost
wish to show himself to her. As his presence is not corporeal, a ghost
may be present to but one of a company.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: 1. 'Who, lapsed (<emphasis>fallen, guilty</emphasis>), lets action slip in
delay and suffering.' 2. 'Who, lapsed in (<emphasis>fallen in, overwhelmed by</emphasis>)
delay and suffering, omits' &amp;c. 3. 'lapsed in respect of time, and
because of passion'—the meaning of the preposition <emphasis>in</emphasis>, common to
both, reacted upon by the word it governs. 4. 'faulty both in delaying,
and in yielding to suffering, when action is required.' 5. 'lapsed
through having too much time and great suffering.' 6. 'allowing himself
to be swept along by time and grief.'</p>
<p>Surely there is not another writer whose words would so often admit of
such multiform and varied interpretation—each form good, and true, and
suitable to the context! He seems to see at once all the relations of a
thing, and to try to convey them at once, in an utterance single as the
thing itself. He would condense the infinite soul of the meaning into
the trembling, overtaxed body of the phrase!]</p>
<p>[Footnote 13: In the renewed presence of the Ghost, all its former
influence and all the former conviction of its truth, return upon him.
He knows also how his behaviour must appear to the Ghost, and sees
himself as the Ghost sees him. Confronted with the gracious figure, how
should he think of self-justification! So far from being able to explain
things, he even forgets the doubt that had held him back—it has
vanished from the noble presence! He is now in the world of belief; the
world of doubt is nowhere!—Note the masterly opposition of moods.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: The Ghost here judges, as alone is possible to him, from
what he knows—from the fact that his brother Claudius has not yet made
his appearance in the ghost-world. Not understanding Hamlet's
difficulties, he mistakes Hamlet himself.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: He mistakes also, through his tenderness, the condition of
his wife—imagining, it would seem, that she feels his presence, though
she cannot see him, or recognize the source of the influence which he
supposes to be moving her conscience: she is only perturbed by Hamlet's
behaviour.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 5: His last word ere he vanishes utterly, concerns his queen;
he is tender and gracious still to her who sent him to hell. This
attitude of the Ghost towards his faithless wife, is one of the
profoundest things in the play. All the time she is not thinking of him
any more than seeing him—for 'is he not dead!'—is looking straight at
where he stands, but is all unaware of him.]</p>

mechanical obedience. The description his mother gives of him makes it
seem as if the Ghost were drawing his ghost out to himself, and turning
his body thereby half dead.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 4: —<emphasis>time</emphasis> being a great part of music. Shakspere more than
once or twice employs <emphasis>music</emphasis> as a symbol with reference to corporeal
condition: see, for instance, <emphasis>As you like it</emphasis>, act i. sc. 2, 'But is
there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides? is there yet
another dotes upon rib-breaking?' where the <emphasis>broken music</emphasis> may be
regarded as the antithesis of the <emphasis>healthful music</emphasis> here.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: <emphasis>swoln, pampered</emphasis>: an allusion to the <emphasis>purse</emphasis> itself,
whether intended or not, is suggested.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: <emphasis>bend, bow</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: To <emphasis>assume</emphasis> is to take to one: by <emphasis>assume a virtue</emphasis>, Hamlet
does not mean <emphasis>pretend</emphasis>—but the very opposite: <emphasis>to pretend</emphasis> is <emphasis>to hold
forth, to show</emphasis>; what he means is, 'Adopt a virtue'—that of
<emphasis>abstinence</emphasis>—'and act upon it, order your behaviour by it, although you
may not <emphasis>feel</emphasis> it. Choose the virtue—take it, make it yours.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: This omitted passage is obscure with the special
Shaksperean obscurity that comes of over-condensation. He omitted it, I
think, because of its obscurity. Its general meaning is plain
enough—that custom helps the man who tries to assume a virtue, as well
as renders it more and more difficult for him who indulges in vice to
leave it. I will paraphrase: 'That monster, Custom, who eats away all
sense, the devil of habits, is angel yet in this, that, for the exercise
of fair and good actions, he also provides a habit, a suitable frock or
livery, that is easily put on.' The play with the two senses of the word
<emphasis>habit</emphasis> is more easily seen than set forth. To paraphrase more freely:
'That devil of habits, Custom, who eats away all sense of wrong-doing,
has yet an angel-side to him, in that he gives a man a mental dress, a
habit, helpful to the doing of the right thing.' The idea of hypocrisy
does not come in at all. The advice of Hamlet is: 'Be virtuous in your
actions, even if you cannot in your feelings; do not do the wrong thing
you would like to do, and custom will render the abstinence easy.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: I suspect it should be '<emphasis>Of habits evil</emphasis>'—the antithesis
to <emphasis>angel</emphasis> being <emphasis>monster</emphasis>.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 10: This passage, like the rest, I hold to be omitted by
Shakspere himself. It represents Hamlet as divining the plot with whose
execution his false friends were entrusted. The Poet had at first
intended Hamlet to go on board the vessel with a design formed upon this
for the out-witting of his companions, and to work out that design.
Afterwards, however, he alters his plan, and represents his escape as
more plainly providential: probably he did not see how to manage it by
any scheme of Hamlet so well as by the attack of a pirate; possibly he
wished to write the passage (246) in which Hamlet, so consistently with
his character, attributes his return to the divine shaping of the end
rough-hewn by himself. He had designs—'dear plots'—but they were other
than fell out—a rough-hewing that was shaped to a different end. The
discomfiture of his enemies was not such as he had designed: it was
brought about by no previous plot, but through a discovery. At the same
time his deliverance was not effected by the fingering of the packet,
but by the attack of the pirate: even the re-writing of the commission
did nothing towards his deliverance, resulted only in the punishment of
his traitorous companions. In revising the Quarto, the Poet sees that
the passage before us, in which is expressed the strongest suspicion of
his companions, with a determination to outwit and punish them, is
inconsistent with the representation Hamlet gives afterwards of a
restlessness and suspicion newly come upon him, which he attributes to
the Divinity.</p>
<p>Neither was it likely he would say so much to his mother while so little
sure of her as to warn her, on the ground of danger to herself, against
revealing his sanity to the king. As to this, however, the portion
omitted might, I grant, be regarded as an <emphasis>aside</emphasis>.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 5: We have no reason to think the queen inventing here: what
could she gain by it? the point indeed was rather against Hamlet, as
showing it was not Polonius he had thought to kill. He was more than
ever annoyed with the contemptible old man, who had by his
meddlesomeness brought his death to his door; but he was very sorry
nevertheless over Ophelia's father: those rough words in his last speech
are spoken with the tears running down his face. We have seen the
strange, almost discordant mingling in him of horror and humour, after
the first appearance of the Ghost, 58, 60: something of the same may be
supposed when he finds he has killed Polonius: in the highstrung nervous
condition that must have followed such a talk with his mother, it would
be nowise strange that he should weep heartily even in the midst of
contemptuous anger. Or perhaps a sudden breakdown from attempted show of
indifference, would not be amiss in the representation.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 9: Here most modern editors insert, '<emphasis>so, haply, slander</emphasis>'.
But, although I think the Poet left out this obscure passage merely from
dissatisfaction with it, I believe it renders a worthy sense as it
stands. The antecedent to <emphasis>whose</emphasis> is <emphasis>friends</emphasis>: <emphasis>cannon</emphasis> is nominative
to <emphasis>transports</emphasis>; and the only difficulty is the epithet <emphasis>poysned</emphasis>
applied to <emphasis>shot</emphasis>, which seems transposed from the idea of an
<emphasis>unfriendly</emphasis> whisper. Perhaps Shakspere wrote <emphasis>poysed shot</emphasis>. But taking
this as it stands, the passage might be paraphrased thus: 'Whose
(favourable) whisper over the world's diameter (<emphasis>from one side of the
world to the other</emphasis>), as level (<emphasis>as truly aimed</emphasis>) as the cannon (of an
evil whisper) transports its poisoned shot to his blank (<emphasis>the white
centre of the target</emphasis>), may shoot past our name (so keeping us clear),
and hit only the invulnerable air.' ('<emphasis>the intrenchant air</emphasis>': <emphasis>Macbeth</emphasis>,
act v. sc. 8). This interpretation rests on the idea of
over-condensation with its tendency to seeming confusion—the only fault
I know in the Poet—a grand fault, peculiarly his own, born of the
beating of his wings against the impossible. It is much as if, able to
think two thoughts at once, he would compel his phrase to utter them at
once.]</p>

<p>This was the act-pause, the natural end of act iii.</p>
<p>But when the author struck out all but the commencement of the scene,
leaving only the three little speeches of Fortinbras and his captain,
then plainly the act-pause must fall at the end of the preceding scene.
He therefore altered the end of the last verse to make it rime with the
foregoing, in accordance with his frequent way of using a rime before an
important pause.</p>
<p>It perplexes us to think how on his way to the vessel, Hamlet could fall
in with the Norwegian captain. This may have been one of Shakspere's
reasons for striking the whole scene out—but he had other and more
pregnant reasons.]</p>

and cause much affliction to the people that make the war.' On the other

health.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: Note his freedom.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: <emphasis>See</emphasis> 'examples grosse as earth' <emphasis>below</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: While every word that Shakspere wrote we may well take
pains to grasp thoroughly, my endeavour to cast light on this passage is
made with the distinct understanding in my own mind that the author
himself disapproved of and omitted it, and that good reason is not
wanting why he should have done so. At the same time, if my student, for
this book is for those who would have help and will take pains to the
true understanding of the play, would yet retain the passage, I protest
against the acceptance of Hamlet's judgment of himself, except as
revealing the simplicity and humility of his nature and character. That
as often as a vivid memory of either interview with the Ghost came back
upon him, he should feel rebuked and ashamed, and vexed with himself,
is, in the morally, intellectually, and emotionally troubled state of
his mind, nowise the less natural that he had the best of reasons for
the delay because of which he <emphasis>here</emphasis> so unmercifully abuses himself. A
man of self-satisfied temperament would never in similar circumstances
have done so. But Hamlet was, by nature and education, far from such
self-satisfaction; and there is in him besides such a strife and turmoil
of opposing passions and feelings and apparent duties, as can but rarely
rise in a human soul. With which he ought to side, his conscience is not
sure—sides therefore now with one, now with another. At the same time
it is by no means the long delay the critics imagine of which he is
accusing himself—it is only that the thing <emphasis>is not done</emphasis>.</p>
<p>In certain moods the action a man dislikes will <emphasis>therefore</emphasis> look to him
the more like a duty; and this helps to prevent Hamlet from knowing
always how great a part conscience bears in the omission because of
which he condemns and even contemns himself. The conscience does not
naturally examine itself—is not necessarily self-conscious. In any
soliloquy, a man must speak from his present mood: we who are not
suffering, and who have many of his moods before us, ought to understand
Hamlet better than he understands himself. To himself, sitting in
judgment on himself, it would hardly appear a decent cause of, not to
say reason for, a moment's delay in punishing his uncle, that he was so
weighed down with misery because of his mother and Ophelia, that it
seemed of no use to kill one villain out of the villainous world; it
would seem but 'bestial oblivion'; and, although his reputation as a
prince was deeply concerned, <emphasis>any</emphasis> reflection on the consequences to
himself would at times appear but a 'craven scruple'; while at times
even the whispers of conscience might seem a 'thinking too precisely on
the event.' A conscientious man of changeful mood wilt be very ready in
either mood to condemn the other. The best and rightest men will
sometimes accuse themselves in a manner that seems to those who know
them best, unfounded, unreasonable, almost absurd. We must not, I say,
take the hero's judgment of himself as the author's judgment of him. The
two judgments, that of a man upon himself from within, and that of his
beholder upon him from without, are not congeneric. They are different
in origin and in kind, and cannot be adopted either of them into the
source of the other without most serious and dangerous mistake. So
adopted, each becomes another thing altogether. It is to me probable
that, although it involves other unfitnesses, the Poet omitted the
passage chiefly from coming to see the danger of its giving occasion, or
at least support, to an altogether mistaken and unjust idea of his
Hamlet.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 7: Ophelia's words.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: I am in doubt whether this passage from 'What is a man'
down to 'unused,' does not refer to the king, and whether Hamlet is not
persuading himself that it can be no such objectionable thing to kill
one hardly above a beast. At all events it is far more applicable to the
king: it was not one of Hamlet's faults, in any case, to fail of using
his reason. But he may just as well accuse himself of that too! At the
same time the worst neglect of reason lies in not carrying out its
conclusions, and if we cannot justify Hamlet in his delay, the passage
is of good application to him. 'Bestiall oblivion' does seem to connect
himself with the reflection; but how thoroughly is the thing intended by
such a phrase alien from the character of Hamlet!]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: —the mental faculty of running hither and thither: 'We
look before and after.' <emphasis>Shelley: To a Skylark</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: —the forgetfulness of such a beast as he has just

<p>[Footnote 11: —the <emphasis>consequences</emphasis>. The scruples that come of thinking
of the event, Hamlet certainly had: that they were <emphasis>craven</emphasis> scruples,
that his thinking was too precise, I deny to the face of the noble
self-accuser. Is that a craven scruple which, seeing no good to result
from the horrid deed, shrinks from its irretrievableness, and demands at
least absolute assurance of guilt? or that 'a thinking too precisely on
the event,' to desire, as the prince of his people, to leave an un
wounded name behind him?]</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: This passage is the strongest there is on the side of the
ordinary misconception of the character of Hamlet. It comes from
himself; and it is as ungenerous as it is common and unfair to use such
a weapon against a man. Does any but St. Paul himself say he was the
chief of sinners? Consider Hamlet's condition, tormented on all sides,
within and without, and think whether this outbreak against himself be
not as unfair as it is natural. Lest it should be accepted against him,
Shakspere did well to leave it out. In bitter disappointment, both
because of what is and what is not, both because of what he has done and
what he has failed to do, having for the time lost all chance, with the
last vision of the Ghost still haunting his eyes, his last reproachful
words yet ringing in his ears, are we bound to take his judgment of
himself because it is against himself? Are we <emphasis>bound</emphasis> to take any man's
judgment because it is against himself? I answer, 'No more than if it
were for himself.' A good man's judgment, where he is at all perplexed,
especially if his motive comes within his own question, is ready to be
against himself, as a bad man's is sure to be for himself. Or because he
is a philosopher, does it follow that throughout he understands himself?
Were such a man in cool, untroubled conditions, we might feel compelled
to take his judgment, but surely not here! A philosopher in such state
as Hamlet's would understand the quality of his spiritual operations
with no more certainty than another man. In his present mood, Hamlet
forgets the cogency of the reasons that swayed him in the other; forgets
that his uppermost feeling then was doubt, as horror, indignation, and
conviction are uppermost now. Things were never so clear to Hamlet as to
us.</p>
<p>But how can he say he has strength and means—in the position in which
he now finds himself? I am glad to be able to believe, let my defence of
Hamlet against himself be right or wrong, that Shakspere intended the
omission of the passage. I lay nothing on the great lack of logic
throughout the speech, for that would not make it unfit for Hamlet in
such mood, while it makes its omission from the play of less consequence
to my general argument.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 13: <emphasis>threaten</emphasis>. This supports my argument as to the great
soliloquy—that it was death as the result of his slaying the king, or
attempting to do so, not death by suicide, he was thinking of: he
expected to die himself in the punishing of his uncle.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 14: He had had no chance but that when the king was on his

<p>[Footnote 18: This soliloquy is antithetic to the other. Here is no

<p>[Footnote 19: If, with this speech in his mouth, Hamlet goes coolly on
board the vessel, <emphasis>not being compelled thereto</emphasis> (190, 192, 216), and
possessing means to his vengeance, as here he says, and goes merely in
order to hoist Rosincrance and Guildensterne with their own petard—that
is, if we must keep the omitted passages, then the author exposes his
hero to a more depreciatory judgment than any from which I would justify
him, and a conception of his character entirely inconsistent with the
rest of the play. He did not observe the risk at the time he wrote the
passage, but discovering it afterwards, rectified the oversight—to the
dissatisfaction of his critics, who have agreed in restoring what he
cancelled.]</p>

banishment, destroyed all the hope the queen had been fostering in her

<p>[Footnote 6: 'a true son to your father.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: 'feel much grief for it.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: Laertes is a ranter—false everywhere.</p>
<p>Plainly he is introduced as the foil from which Hamlet 'shall stick
fiery off.' In this speech he shows his moral condition directly the
opposite of Hamlet's: he has no principle but revenge. His conduct ought
to be quite satisfactory to Hamlet's critics; there is action enough in
it of the very kind they would have of Hamlet; and doubtless it would be
satisfactory to them but for the treachery that follows. The one, dearly
loving a father who deserves immeasurably better of him than Polonius of
Laertes, will not for the sake of revenge disregard either conscience,
justice, or grace; the other will not delay even to inquire into the
facts of his father's fate, but will act at once on hearsay, rushing to
a blind satisfaction that cannot even be called retaliation, caring for
neither right nor wrong, cursing conscience and the will of God, and
daring damnation. He slights assurance as to the hand by which his
father fell, dismisses all reflection that might interfere with a stupid
revenge. To make up one's mind at once, and act without ground, is
weakness, not strength: this Laertes does—and is therefore just the man
to be the villainous, not the innocent, tool of villainy. He who has
sufficing ground and refuses to act is weak; but the ground that will
satisfy the populace, of which the commonplace critic is the fair type,
will not satisfy either the man of conscience or of wisdom. The mass of
world-bepraised action owes its existence to the pressure of
circumstance, not to the will and conscience of the man. Hamlet waits
for light, even with his heart accusing him; Laertes rushes into the
dark, dagger in hand, like a mad Malay: so he kill, he cares not whom.
Such a man is easily tempted to the vilest treachery, for the light that
is in him is darkness; he is not a true man; he is false in himself.
This is what comes of his father's maxim:</p>
<p>    To thine own self be true;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And it must follow, <emphasis>as the night the day</emphasis> (!)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thou canst not then be false to any man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Like the aphorism 'Honesty is the best policy,' it reveals the
difference between a fact and a truth. Both sayings are correct as
facts, but as guides of conduct devilishly false, leading to dishonesty
and treachery. To be true to the divine self in us, is indeed to be true
to all; but it is only by being true to all, against the ever present
and urging false self, that at length we shall see the divine self rise
above the chaotic waters of our selfishness, and know it so as to be
true to it.</p>
<p>Of Laertes we must note also that it is not all for love of his father
that he is ready to cast allegiance to hell, and kill the king: he has
the voice of the people to succeed him.]</p>

proposal the king is about to make, it is needful that all possible

his spirit, and overwhelm what poor judgment and yet poorer conscience
he had. Altogether unprepared, he learns Ophelia's pitiful condition by
the sudden sight of the harrowing change in her—and not till after that

impersonal: 'where <emphasis>things</emphasis>, where <emphasis>all</emphasis> is fine,' that is, 'in a fine

where the soul also is fine, she sends from it' &amp;c. But the <emphasis>where</emphasis> may
be equal, perhaps, to <emphasis>whereas</emphasis>. I can hardly think the phrase means
merely '<emphasis>and where it is in love</emphasis>.' It might intend—'and where Love is
fine, it sends' &amp;c. The 'precious instance of itself,' that is,
'something that is a part and specimen of itself,' is here the 'young
maid's wits': they are sent after the 'old man's life.'—These three

<p>[Footnote 9: Note once more the unfailing readiness of Hamlet where
there was no question as to the fitness of the action seemingly
required. This is the man who by too much thinking, forsooth, has
rendered himself incapable of action!—so far ahead of the foremost
behind him, that, when the pirate, not liking such close quarters, 'on
the instant got clear,' he is the only one on her deck! There was no
question here as to what ought to be done: the pirate grappled them; he
boarded her. Thereafter, with his prompt faculty for dealing with men,
he soon comes to an understanding with his captors, and they agree, upon
some certain condition, to put him on shore.</p>
<p>He writes in unusual spirits; for he has now gained full, presentable,
and indisputable proof of the treachery which before he scarcely
doubted, but could not demonstrate. The present instance of it has to do
with himself, not his father, but in itself would justify the slaying of
his uncle, whose plausible way had possibly perplexed him so that he
could not thoroughly believe him the villain he was: bad as he must be,
could he actually have killed his own brother, and <emphasis>such</emphasis> a brother? A
better man than Laertes might have acted more promptly than Hamlet, and
so happened to <emphasis>do</emphasis> right; but he would not have <emphasis>been</emphasis> right, for the
proof was <emphasis>not</emphasis> sufficient.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: The value Hamlet sets on his discovery, evident in his
joyous urgency to share it with his friend, is explicable only on the
ground of the relief it is to his mind to be now at length quite certain
of his duty.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 2: <emphasis>arm'd</emphasis> is certainly the right, and a true Shaksperean
word:—it was no fault in the aim, but in the force of the flight—no
matter of the eye, but of the arm, which could not give momentum enough
to such slightly timbered arrows. The fault in the construction of the
last line, I need not remark upon.</p>
<p>I think there is a hint of this the genuine meaning even in the
blundered and partly unintelligible reading of the <emphasis>Quarto</emphasis>. If we leave
out 'for so loued,' we have this: 'So that my arrows, too slightly
timbered, would have reverted armed to my bow again, but not (<emphasis>would not
have gone</emphasis>) where I have aimed them,'—implying that his arrows would
have turned their armed heads against himself.</p>
<p>What the king says here is true, but far from <emphasis>the</emphasis> truth: he feared
driving Hamlet, and giving him at the same time opportunity, to speak in
his own defence and render his reasons.]</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: This fine speech is yet spoken in the character of madman,
which Hamlet puts on once more the moment he has to appear before the
king. Its poetry and dignity belong to Hamlet's feeling; its
extravagance to his assumed insanity. It must be remembered that death
is a small affair to Hamlet beside his mother's life, and that the death
of Ophelia may even be some consolation to him.</p>
<p>In the <emphasis>Folio</emphasis>, a few lines back, Laertes leaps into the grave. There is
no such direction in the <emphasis>Q</emphasis>. In neither is Hamlet said to leap into the
grave; only the <emphasis>1st Q.</emphasis> so directs. It is a stage-business that must
please the <emphasis>common</emphasis> actor of Hamlet; but there is nothing in the text
any more than in the margin of <emphasis>Folio</emphasis> or <emphasis>Quarto</emphasis> to justify it, and it
would but for the horror of it be ludicrous. The coffin is supposed to
be in the grave: must Laertes jump down upon it, followed by Hamlet, and
the two fight and trample over the body?</p>
<p>Yet I take the '<emphasis>Leaps in the grave</emphasis>' to be an action intended for
Laertes by the Poet. His 'Hold off the earth a while,' does not
necessarily imply that the body is already in the grave. He has before
said, 'Lay her i'th' earth': then it was not in the grave. It is just
about to be lowered, when, with that cry of 'Hold off the earth a
while,' he jumps into the grave, and taking the corpse, on a bier at the
side of it, in his arms, calls to the spectators to pile a mountain on
them—in the wild speech that brings out Hamlet. The quiet dignity of
Hamlet's speech does not comport with his jumping into the grave:
Laertes comes out of the grave, and flies at Hamlet's throat. So, at
least, I would have the thing acted.</p>
<p>There is, however, nothing in the text to show that Laertes comes out of
the grave, and if the manager insist on the traditional mode, I would
suggest that the grave be represented much larger. In Mr. Jewitt's book
on Grave-Mounds, I read of a 'female skeleton in a grave six feet deep,
ten feet long, and eight feet wide.' Such a grave would give room for
both beside the body, and dismiss the hideousness of the common
representation.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: —<emphasis>springing out of the grave and flying at Hamlet</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: Note the temper, self-knowledge, self-government, and
self-distrust of Hamlet.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: The eyelids last of all become incapable of motion.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: That he loved her is the only thing to explain the
harshness of his behaviour to her. Had he not loved her and not been
miserable about her, he would have been as polite to her as well bred
people would have him.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 8: Emphasis on <emphasis>Be</emphasis>, which I take for the <emphasis>imperative mood</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: The moment it is uttered, he recognizes and confesses to
the rant, ashamed of it even under the cover of his madness. It did not
belong <emphasis>altogether</emphasis> to the madness. Later he expresses to Horatio his
regret in regard to this passage between him and Laertes, and afterwards
apologizes to Laertes. 252, 262.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the speech in all the play of which it is most difficult
to get into a sympathetic comprehension. The student must call to mind
the elements at war in Hamlet's soul, and generating discords in his
behaviour: to those comes now the shock of Ophelia's death; the last tie
that bound him to life is gone—the one glimmer of hope left him for
this world! The grave upon whose brink he has been bandying words with
the sexton, is for <emphasis>her</emphasis>! Into such a consciousness comes the rant of
Laertes. Only the forms of madness are free to him, while no form is too
strong in which to repudiate indifference to Ophelia: for her sake, as
well as to relieve his own heart, he casts the clear confession of his
love into her grave. He is even jealous, over her dead body, of her
brother's profession of love to her—as if any brother could love as he
loved! This is foolish, no doubt, but human, and natural to a certain
childishness in grief. 252.</p>
<p>Add to this, that Hamlet—see later in his speeches to Osricke—had a
lively inclination to answer a fool according to his folly (256), to
outherod Herod if Herod would rave, out-euphuize Euphues himself if he
would be ridiculous:—the digestion of all these things in the retort of
meditation will result, I would fain think, in an understanding and
artistic justification of even this speech of Hamlet: the more I
consider it the truer it seems. If proof be necessary that real feeling
is mingled in the madness of the utterance, it may be found in the fact
that he is immediately ashamed of its extravagance.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: I would suggest that the one paper, which he has just
shown, is a commission the king gave to himself; the other, which he is
about to show, that given to Rosincrance and Guildensterne. He is
setting forth his proof of the king's treachery.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: —of the king's words and behaviour, possibly, in giving
him his papers, Horatio having been present; or it might mean, 'Have you
got the things I have just told you clear in your mind?']</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: '—as if I could forget a single particular of it!']</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: The <emphasis>Shaping Divinity</emphasis> was moving him.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: The fetters called <emphasis>bilboes</emphasis> fasten a couple of mutinous
sailors together by the legs.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: Does he not here check himself and begin
afresh—remembering that the praise belongs to the Divinity?]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: <emphasis>pall</emphasis>—from the root of <emphasis>pale</emphasis>—'come to nothing.' He had
had his plots from which he hoped much; the king's commission had
rendered them futile. But he seems to have grown doubtful of his plans
before, probably through the doubt of his companions which led him to
seek acquaintance with their commission, and he may mean that his 'dear
plots' had begun to pall <emphasis>upon him</emphasis>. Anyhow the sudden 'indiscretion' of
searching for and unsealing the ambassadors' commission served him as
nothing else could have served him.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: —even by our indiscretion. Emphasis on <emphasis>shapes</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: Here is another sign of Hamlet's religion. 24, 125, 260.
We start to work out an idea, but the result does not correspond with
the idea: another has been at work along with us. We rough-hew—block
out our marble, say for a Mercury; the result is an Apollo. Hamlet had
rough-hewn his ends—he had begun plans to certain ends, but had he been
allowed to go on shaping them alone, the result, even had he carried out
his plans and shaped his ends to his mind, would have been failure.
Another mallet and chisel were busy shaping them otherwise from the
first, and carrying them out to a true success. For <emphasis>success</emphasis> is not the
success of plans, but the success of ends.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: Emphasize <emphasis>I</emphasis> and <emphasis>them</emphasis>, as the rhythm requires, and the
phrase becomes picturesque.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 3: Note Hamlet's rapid practicality—not merely in devising,
but in carrying out.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: statesmen.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: '<emphasis>Yeomen of the guard of the king's body</emphasis> were anciently
two hundred and fifty men, of the best rank under gentry, and of larger
stature than ordinary; every one being required to be six feet
high.'—<emphasis>E. Chambers' Cyclopaedia</emphasis>. Hence '<emphasis>yeoman's</emphasis> service' must mean
the very best of service.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: Note our common phrase: 'I wrote to this effect.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: 'as he would have Peace stand between their friendships
like a comma between two words.' Every point has in it a conjunctive, as
well as a disjunctive element: the former seems the one regarded
here—only that some amities require more than a comma to separate them.
The <emphasis>comma</emphasis> does not make much of a figure—is good enough for its
position, however; if indeed the fact be not, that, instead of standing
for <emphasis>Peace</emphasis>, it does not even stand for itself, but for some other word.
I do not for my part think so.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: Dr. Johnson says there is a quibble here with <emphasis>asses</emphasis> as
beasts of <emphasis>charge</emphasis> or burden. It is probable enough, seeing, as Malone
tells us, that in Warwickshire, as did Dr. Johnson himself, they
pronounce <emphasis>as</emphasis> hard. In Aberdeenshire the sound of the <emphasis>s</emphasis> varies with
the intent of the word: '<emphasis>az</emphasis> he said'; '<emphasis>ass</emphasis> strong <emphasis>az</emphasis> a horse.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: To what purpose is this half-voyage to England made part of
the play? The action—except, as not a few would have it, the very
action be delay—is nowise furthered by it; Hamlet merely goes and
returns.</p>
<p>To answer this question, let us find the real ground for Hamlet's
reflection, 'There's a Divinity that shapes our ends.' Observe, he is
set at liberty without being in the least indebted to the finding of the
commission—by the attack, namely, of the pirate; and this was not the
shaping of his ends of which he was thinking when he made the
reflection, for it had reference to the finding of the commission. What
then was the ground of the reflection? And what justifies the whole
passage in relation to the Poet's object, the character of Hamlet?</p>
<p>This, it seems to me:—</p>
<p>Although Hamlet could not have had much doubt left with regard to his
uncle's guilt, yet a man with a fine, delicate—what most men would
think, because so much more exacting than theirs—fastidious conscience,
might well desire some proof more positive yet, before he did a deed so
repugnant to his nature, and carrying in it such a loud condemnation of
his mother. And more: he might well wish to have something to <emphasis>show</emphasis>: a
man's conviction is no proof, though it may work in others inclination
to receive proof. Hamlet is sent to sea just to get such proof as will
not only thoroughly satisfy himself, but be capable of being shown to
others. He holds now in his hand—to lay before the people—the two
contradictory commissions. By his voyage then he has gained both
assurance of his duty, and provision against the consequence he mainly
dreaded, that of leaving a wounded name behind him. 272. This is the
shaping of his ends—so exactly to his needs, so different from his
rough-hewn plans—which is the work of the Divinity. The man who desires
to know his duty that he may <emphasis>do</emphasis> it, who will not shirk it when he does
know it, will have time allowed him and the thing made plain to him; his
perplexity will even strengthen and purify his will. The weak man is he
who, certain of what is required of him, fails to meet it: so never once
fails Hamlet. Note, in all that follows, that a load seems taken off
him: after a gracious tardiness to believe up to the point of action, he
is at length satisfied. Hesitation belongs to the noble nature, to
Hamlet; precipitation to the poor nature, to Laertes, the son of
Polonius. Compare Brutus in <emphasis>Julius Caesar</emphasis>—a Hamlet in favourable
circumstances, with Hamlet—a Brutus in the most unfavourable
circumstances conceivable.]</p>

underhand dealings.' The <emphasis>Sh. Lex.</emphasis> explains <emphasis>insinuation</emphasis> as
<emphasis>meddling</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: With the concern of Horatio for the fate of Rosincrance and
Guildensterne, Hamlet shows no sympathy. It has been objected to his
character that there is nothing in the play to show them privy to the
contents of their commission; to this it would be answer enough, that
Hamlet is satisfied of their worthlessness, and that their whole
behaviour in the play shows them merest parasites; but, at the same
time, we must note that, in changing the commission, he had no
intention, could have had no thought, of letting them go to England
without him: that was a pure shaping of their ends by the Divinity.
Possibly his own 'dear plots' had in them the notion of getting help
against his uncle from the king of England, in which case he would
willingly of course have continued his journey; but whatever they may be
supposed to have been, they were laid in connection with the voyage, not
founded on the chance of its interruption. It is easy to imagine a man
like him, averse to the shedding of blood, intending interference for
their lives: as heir apparent, he would certainly have been listened to.
The tone of his reply to Horatio is that of one who has been made the
unintending cause of a deserved fate: the thing having fallen out so,
the Divinity having so shaped their ends, there was nothing in their
character, any more than in that of Polonius, to make him regret their
death, or the part he had had in it.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: The 'mighty opposites' here are the king and Hamlet.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: Perhaps, as Hamlet talked, he has been parenthetically
glancing at the real commission. Anyhow conviction is growing stronger
in Horatio, whom, for the occasion, we may regard as a type of the
public.]</p>

<p>[Footnote 9: Now that he is assured of what is right, the Shadow that
waits him on the path to it, has no terror for him. He ceases to be
anxious as to 'what dreams may come,' as to the 'something after death,'
as to 'the undiscovered country,' the moment his conscience is
satisfied. 120. It cannot now make a coward of him. It was never in
regard to the past that Hamlet dreaded death, but in regard to the
righteousness of the action which was about to occasion his death. Note
that he expects death; at least he has long made up his mind to the
great risk of it—the death referred to in the soliloquy—which, after
all, was not that which did overtake him. There is nothing about suicide
here, nor was there there.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: 'a man's life must soon be over anyhow.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: The approach of death causes him to think of and regret
even the small wrongs he has done; he laments his late behaviour to
Laertes, and makes excuse for him: the similarity of their condition,
each having lost a father by violence, ought, he says, to have taught
him gentleness with him. The <emphasis>1st Quarto</emphasis> is worth comparing here:—</p>

<p><emphasis>Enter a Lord</emphasis>.[15]</p>
<p><emphasis>Lord</emphasis>. My Lord, his Maiestie commended him to you by young
Ostricke,[16] who brings backe to him that you attend him in the hall,
he sends to know if your pleasure hold to play with <emphasis>Laertes</emphasis>, or that
you will take longer time?[17]</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. I am constant to my purposes, they followe the Kings pleasure,
if his fitnes speakes, mine is ready[18]: now or whensoeuer, prouided I
be so able as now.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lord</emphasis>. The King, and Queene, and all are comming downe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. In happy time.[19]</p>
<p><emphasis>Lord</emphasis>. The Queene desires you to vse some gentle
entertainment[20] <emphasis>Laertes</emphasis>, before you fall to play.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ham</emphasis>. Shee well instructs me.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 1: 'Well, he <emphasis>is</emphasis> a young one!']</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: '<emphasis>Com'ply</emphasis>,' with accent on first syllable: <emphasis>comply with</emphasis>
means <emphasis>pay compliments to, compliment</emphasis>. See <emphasis>Q.</emphasis> reading: 'A did sir
with':—<emphasis>sir</emphasis> here is a verb—<emphasis>sir with</emphasis> means <emphasis>say sir to</emphasis>: 'he
<emphasis>sirred, complied</emphasis> with his nurse's breast before &amp;c.' Hamlet speaks in
mockery of the affected court-modes of speech and address, the fashion
of euphuism—a mechanical attempt at the poetic.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: <emphasis>a flock of birds</emphasis>—suggested by '<emphasis>This Lapwing</emphasis>.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: 'the mere mode.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: 'and external custom of intercourse.' But here too I rather
take the <emphasis>Q.</emphasis> to be right: 'They have only got the fashion of the time;
and, out of a habit of wordy conflict, (they have got) a collection of
tricks of speech,—a yesty, frothy mass, with nothing in it, which
carries them in triumph through the most foolish and fastidious (nice,
choice, punctilious, whimsical) judgments.' <emphasis>Yesty</emphasis> I take to be right,
and <emphasis>prophane</emphasis> (vulgar) to have been altered by the Poet to <emphasis>fond</emphasis>
(foolish); of <emphasis>trennowed</emphasis> I can make nothing beyond a misprint.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: Hamlet had just blown Osricke to his trial in his chosen
kind, and the bubble had burst. The braggart gentleman had no faculty to
generate after the dominant fashion, no invention to support his
ambition—had but a yesty collection, which failing him the moment
something unconventional was wanted, the fool had to look a discovered
fool.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: 'I shall win by the odds allowed me; he will not exceed me
three hits.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: He has a presentiment of what is coming.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: Nothing in this world is of much consequence to him now.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Also, he believes in 'a special Providence.']</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 10: 'a yielding, a sinking' at the heart? The <emphasis>Sh. Lex.</emphasis> says
<emphasis>misgiving</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: 'obey the warning.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: 'go to them before they come here'—'<emphasis>prevent</emphasis> their
coming.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 13: The knowledge, even, of what is to come could never, any
more than ordinary expediency, be the <emphasis>law</emphasis> of a man's conduct. St.
Paul, informed by the prophet Agabus of the troubles that awaited him at
Jerusalem, and entreated by his friends not to go thither, believed the
prophet, and went on to Jerusalem to be delivered into the hands of the
Gentiles.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 14: One of Shakspere's many allusions to sayings of the Lord.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 15: Osricke does not come back: he has begged off but ventures
later, under the wing of the king.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 16: May not this form of the name suggest that in it is
intended the 'foolish' ostrich?]</p>
<p>[Footnote 17: The king is making delay: he has to have his 'union'
ready.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 18: 'if he feels ready, I am.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 19: 'They are <emphasis>well-come</emphasis>.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 20: 'to be polite to Laertes.' The print shows where <emphasis>to</emphasis> has
slipped out.</p>
<p>The queen is anxious; she distrusts Laertes, and the king's influence
over him.]</p>

That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house,               [Sidenote: my]</p>

<p>

And hurt my Mother.[15]                         [Sidenote: brother.[15]]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: 'it'—death, the end.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: His father had been taken unready. 54.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: <emphasis>Point</emphasis>: 'all. Since'; 'leaves, what'—'Since no man has
anything of what he has left, those who left it late are in the same
position as those who left it early.' Compare the common saying, 'It
will be all the same in a hundred years.' The <emphasis>Q.</emphasis> reading comes much to
the same thing—'knows of ought he leaves'—'has any knowledge of it,
anything to do with it, in any sense possesses it.'</p>
<p>We may find a deeper meaning in the passage, however—surely not too
deep for Shakspere:—'Since nothing can be truly said to be possessed as
his own which a man must at one time or another yield; since that which
is <emphasis>own</emphasis> can never be taken from the owner, but solely that which is
lent him; since the nature of a thing that has to be left is not such
that it <emphasis>could</emphasis> be possessed, why should a man mind parting with it
early?'—There is far more in this than merely that at the end of the
day it will be all the same. The thing that ever was really a man's own,
God has given, and God will not, and man cannot, take away. Note the
unity of religion and philosophy in Hamlet: he takes the one true
position. Note also his courage: he has a strong presentiment of death,
but will not turn a step from his way. If Death be coming, he will
confront him. He does not believe in chance. He is ready—that is
willing. All that is needful is, that he should not go as one who cannot
help it, but as one who is for God's will, who chooses that will as his
own.</p>
<p>There is so much behind in Shakspere's characters—so much that can only
be hinted at! The dramatist has not the <emphasis>word</emphasis>-scope of the novelist;
his art gives him little <emphasis>room</emphasis>; he must effect in a phrase what the
other may take pages to. He needs good seconding by his actors as sorely
as the composer needs good rendering of his music by the orchestra. It
is a lesson in unity that the greatest art can least work alone; that
the greatest <emphasis>finder</emphasis> most needs the help of others to show his
<emphasis>findings</emphasis>. The dramatist has live men and women for the very
instruments of his art—who must not be mere instruments, but
fellow-workers; and upon them he is greatly dependent for final outcome.</p>
<p>Here the actor should show a marked calmness and elevation in Hamlet. He
should have around him as it were a luminous cloud, the cloud of his
coming end. A smile not all of this world should close the speech. He
has given himself up, and is at peace.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: Note in this apology the sweetness of Hamlet's nature. How
few are alive enough, that is unselfish and true enough, to be capable
of genuine apology! The low nature always feels, not the wrong, but the
confession of it, degrading.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: —the wrong of his rudeness at the funeral.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: all present.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: —true in a deeper sense than they would understand.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: 'that might roughly awake your nature, honour, and
exception,':—consider the phrase—<emphasis>to take exception at a thing</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: It was by cause of madness, not by cause of evil intent.
For all purpose of excuse it was madness, if only pretended madness; it
was there of another necessity, and excused offence like real madness.
What he said was true, not merely expedient, to the end he meant it to
serve. But all passion may be called madness, because therein the mind
is absorbed with one idea; 'anger is a brief madness,' and he was in a
'towering passion': he proclaims it madness and so abjures it.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 10: 'refuses the wrong altogether—will in his true self have
nothing to do with it.' No evil thing comes of our true selves, and
confession is the casting of it from us, the only true denial. He who
will not confess a wrong, holds to the wrong.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 11: All here depends on the expression in the utterance.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 12: <emphasis>This line not in Q.</emphasis>]</p>
<p>[Footnote 13: This is Hamlet's summing up of the whole—his explanation
of the speech.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 14: 'so far as this in your generous judgment—that you regard
me as having shot &amp;c.']</p>
<p>[Footnote 15: <emphasis>Brother</emphasis> is much easier to accept, though <emphasis>Mother</emphasis> might
be in the simile.</p>
<p>To do justice to the speech we must remember that Hamlet has no quarrel
whatever with Laertes, that he has expressed admiration of him, and that
he is inclined to love him for Ophelia's sake. His apology has no
reference to the fate of his father or his sister; Hamlet is not aware
that Laertes associates him with either, and plainly the public did not
know Hamlet killed Polonius; while Laertes could have no intention of
alluding to the fact, seeing it would frustrate his scheme of
treachery.]</p>

                                                  [Sidenote: better, we]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 1: 'in my own feelings and person.' Laertes does not refer to
his father or sister. He professes to be satisfied in his heart with
Hamlet's apology for his behaviour at the funeral, but not to be sure
whether in the opinion of others, and by the laws of honour, he can
accept it as amends, and forbear to challenge him. But the words 'Whose
motiue in this case should stirre me most to my Reuenge' may refer to
his father and sister, and, if so taken, should be spoken aside. To
accept apology for them and not for his honour would surely be too
barefaced! The point concerning them has not been started.</p>
<p>But why not receive the apology as quite satisfactory? That he would not
seems to show a lingering regard to <emphasis>real</emphasis> honour. A downright villain,
like the king, would have pretended its <emphasis>thorough</emphasis>
acceptance—especially as they were just going to fence like friends;
but he, as regards his honour, will not accept it until justified in
doing so by the opinion of 'some elder masters,' receiving from them 'a
voice and precedent of peace'—counsel to, and justification, or example
of peace. He keeps the door of quarrel open—will not profess to be
<emphasis>altogether</emphasis> friends with him, though he does not hint at his real
ground of offence: that mooted, the match of skill, with its immense
advantages for villainy, would have been impossible. He means treachery
all the time; careful of his honour, he can, like most apes of fashion,
let his honesty go; still, so complex is human nature, he holds his
speech declining thorough reconciliation as a shield to shelter his
treachery from his own contempt: he has taken care not to profess
absolute friendship, and so left room for absolute villainy! He has had
regard to his word! Relieved perhaps by the demoniacal quibble, he
follows it immediately with an utterance of full-blown perfidy.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 2: Perhaps <emphasis>ungorg'd</emphasis> might mean <emphasis>unthrottled</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 3: 'Come on' <emphasis>is not in the Q.</emphasis>—I suspect this <emphasis>Come on</emphasis> but
a misplaced shadow from the '<emphasis>Come one</emphasis>' immediately below, and better
omitted. Hamlet could not say '<emphasis>Come on</emphasis>' before Laertes was ready, and
'<emphasis>Come one</emphasis>' after 'Give us the foils,' would be very awkward. But it
may be said to the attendant courtiers.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 4: He says this while Hamlet is still choosing, in order that
a second bundle of foils, in which is the unbated and poisoned one, may
be brought him. So 'generous and free from all contriving' is Hamlet,
(220) that, even with the presentiment in his heart, he has no fear of
treachery.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 5: As persons of the drama, the Poet means Laertes to be foil
to Hamlet.—With the play upon the word before us, we can hardly help
thinking of the <emphasis>third</emphasis> signification of the word <emphasis>foil</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 6: 'My ignorance will be the foil of darkest night to the
burning star of your skill.' This is no flattery; Hamlet believes
Laertes, to whose praises he has listened (218)—though not with the
envy his uncle attributes to him—the better fencer: he expects to win
only 'at the odds.' 260.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 7: —not '<emphasis>by these pickers and stealers</emphasis>,' his oath to his
false friends. 154.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 8: Plainly a favourite with the king.—He is <emphasis>Ostricke</emphasis> always
in the <emphasis>Q</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 9: 'seen you both play'—though not together.]</p>

enough to prevent her.]</p>

hold of his rapier, wrenches it from him, and stabs him with it in
return.]</p>

with breaks. Its construction is broken.]</p>
<p>[Footnote 14: His conscience starts up, awake and strong, at the
approach of Death. As the show of the world withdraws, the realities
assert themselves. He repents, and makes confession of his sin, seeing
it now in its true nature, and calling it by its own name. It is a
compensation of the weakness of some that they cannot be strong in
wickedness. The king did not so repent, and with his strength was the
more to blame.]</p>

cannot be indifferent to that appearance. He cannot be indifferent to
wearing the look of the thing he hates. Hamlet, that he may be
understood by the nation, makes, with noble confidence in his

<p>[Footnote 10: The end is a half-line after a riming couplet—as if there
were more to come—as there must be after every tragedy. Mere poetic
justice will not satisfy Shakspere in a tragedy, for tragedy is <emphasis>life</emphasis>;
in a comedy it may do well enough, for that deals but with
life-surfaces—and who then more careful of it! but in tragedy something
far higher ought to be aimed at. The end of this drama is reached when
Hamlet, having attained the possibility of doing so, performs his work
<emphasis>in righteousness</emphasis>. The common critical mind would have him left the
fatherless, motherless, loverless, almost friendless king of a
justifiably distrusting nation—with an eternal grief for his father
weighing him down to the abyss; with his mother's sin blackening for him
all womankind, and blasting the face of both heaven and earth; and with
the knowledge in his heart that he had sent the woman he loved, with her
father and her brother, out of the world—maniac, spy, and traitor.
Instead of according him such 'poetic justice,' the Poet gives Hamlet
the only true success of doing his duty to the end—for it was as much
his duty not to act before, as it was his duty to act at last—then
sends him after his Ophelia—into a world where true heart will find
true way of setting right what is wrong, and of atoning for every ill,
wittingly or unwittingly done or occasioned in this.</p>
<p>It seems to me most admirable that Hamlet, being so great, is yet
outwardly so like other people: the Poet never obtrudes his greatness.
And just because he is modest, confessing weakness and perplexity, small
people take him for yet smaller than themselves who never confess
anything, and seldom feel anything amiss with them. Such will adduce
even Hamlet's disparagement of himself to Ophelia when overwhelmed with
a sense of human worthlessness (126), as proof that he was no hero!
They call it weakness that he would not, foolishly and selfishly, make
good his succession against the king, regardless of the law of election,
and careless of the weal of the kingdom for which he shows himself so
anxious even in the throes of death! To my mind he is the grandest hero
in fiction—absolutely human—so troubled, yet so true!]</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>

Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this

<p>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the

of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>
<p>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.</p>

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work

phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
<p>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>
<p>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
<p>

Gutenberg™ License.</p>
<p>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
<p>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>
<p>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
<p>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>
<p>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
