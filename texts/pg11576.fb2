<p><strong>                  INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
<p>The earliest poem in this volume bears the date 1794, when Lamb was
nineteen, the latest 1834, the year of his death; so that it covers an
even longer period of his life than Vol. I.—the "Miscellaneous Prose."
The chronological order which was strictly observed in that volume has
been only partly observed in the following pages—since it seemed better
to keep the plays together and to make a separate section of Lamb's
epigrams. These, therefore, will be found to be outside the general
scheme. Such of Lamb's later poems as he did not himself collect in
volume form will also be found to be out of their chronological
position, partly because it has seemed to me best to give prominence to
those verses which Lamb himself reprinted, and partly because there is
often no indication of the year in which the poem was written.</p>
<p>Another difficulty has been the frequency with which Lamb reprinted some
of his earlier poetry. The text of many of his earliest and best poems
was not fixed until 1818, twenty years or so after their composition. It
had to be decided whether to print these poems in their true order as
they were first published—in Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems on Various Subjects</emphasis>,
1796; in Charles Lloyd's <emphasis>ems on the Death of Priscilla Farmer</emphasis>, 1796;
in Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, second edition, 1797; in <emphasis>Blank Verse</emphasis> by
Charles Lloyd and Charles Lamb, 1798; and in John Woodvil, 1802—with
all their early readings; or whether to disregard chronological
sequence, and wait until the time of the <emphasis>Works</emphasis>—1818—had come, and
print them all together then. I decided, in the interests of their
biographical value, to print them in the order as they first appeared,
particularly as Crabb Robinson tells us that Lamb once said of the
arrangement of a poet's works: "There is only one good order—and that
is the order in which they were written—that is a history of the poet's
mind." It then had to be decided whether to print them in their first
shape, which, unless I repeated them later, would mean the relegation of
Lamb's final text to the Notes, or to print them, at the expense of a
slight infringement upon the chronological scheme, in their final 1818
state, and relegate all earlier readings to the Notes. After much
deliberation I decided that to print them in their final 1818 state was
best, and this therefore I did in the large edition of 1903, to which
the student is referred for all variorum readings, fuller notes and many
illustrations, and have repeated here. In order, however, that the
scheme of Lamb's 1818 edition of his <emphasis>Works</emphasis> might be preserved, I have
indicated in the text the position in the <emphasis>Works</emphasis> occupied by all the
poems that in the present volume have been printed earlier.</p>
<p>The chronological order, in so far as it has been followed, emphasises
the dividing line between Lamb's poetry and his verse. As he grew older
his poetry, for the most part, passed into his prose. His best and
truest poems, with few exceptions, belong to the years before, say,
1805, when he was thirty. After this, following a long interval of
silence, came the brief satirical outburst of 1812, in <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis>,
and the longer one, in 1820, in <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>; then, after another
interval, during which he was busy as Elia, came the period of album
verses, which lasted to the end. The impulse to write personal prose,
which was quickened in Lamb by the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> in 1820, seems to
have taken the place of his old ambition to be a poet. In his later and
more mechanical period there were, however, occasional inspirations, as
when he wrote the sonnet on "Work," in 1819; on "Leisure," in 1821; the
lines in his own Album, in 1827, and, pre-eminently, the poem "On an
Infant Dying as Soon as Born," in 1827.</p>
<p>This volume contains, with the exception of the verse for children,
which will be found in Vol. III. of this edition, all the accessible
poetical work of Charles and Mary Lamb that is known to exist and
several poems not to be found in the large edition. There are probably
still many copies of album verses which have not yet seen the light. In
the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, April, 1824, is a story entitled "The Bride of
Modern Italy," which has for motto the following couplet:—</p>
<p>            My heart is fixt:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            This is the sixt.—<emphasis>Elia</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>but the rest of what seems to be a pleasant catalogue is missing. In a
letter to Coleridge, December 2, 1796, Lamb refers to a poem which has
apparently perished, beginning, "Laugh, all that weep." I have left in
the correspondence the rhyming letters to Ayrton and Dibdin, and an
epigram on "Coelebs in Search of a Wife." I have placed the dedication
to Coleridge at the beginning of this volume, although it belongs
properly only to those poems that are reprinted from the <emphasis>Works</emphasis> of
1818, the prose of which Lamb offered to Martin Burney. But it is too
fine to be put among the Notes, and it may easily, by a pardonable
stretch, be made to refer to the whole body of Lamb's poetical and
dramatic work, although <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis>, 1830, was dedicated separately
to Edward Moxon.</p>
<p>In Mr. Bedford's design for the cover of this edition certain Elian
symbolism will be found. The upper coat of arms is that of Christ's
Hospital, where Lamb was at school; the lower is that of the Inner
Temple, where he was born and spent many years. The figures at the bells
are those which once stood out from the façade of St. Dunstan's Church
in Fleet Street, and are now in Lord Londesborough's garden in Regent's
Park. Lamb shed tears when they were removed. The tricksy sprite and the
candles (brought by Betty) need no explanatory words of mine.</p>

<p><strong>DEDICATION (1818) TO S.T. COLERIDGE, ESQ.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>My Dear Coleridge,</p>
<p>You will smile to see the slender labors of your friend designated by
the title of <emphasis>Works</emphasis>; but such was the wish of the gentlemen who have
kindly undertaken the trouble of collecting them, and from their
judgment could be no appeal.</p>
<p>It would be a kind of disloyalty to offer to any one but yourself a
volume containing the <emphasis>early pieces</emphasis>, which were first published among
your poems, and were fairly derivatives from you and them. My friend
Lloyd and myself came into our first battle (authorship is a sort of
warfare) under cover of the greater Ajax. How this association, which
shall always be a dear and proud recollection to me, came to be broken,
—who snapped the three-fold cord,—whether yourself (but I know that
was not the case) grew ashamed of your former companions,—or whether
(which is by much the more probable) some ungracious bookseller was
author of the separation,—I cannot tell;—but wanting the support of
your friendly elm, (I speak for myself,) my vine has, since that time,
put forth few or no fruits; the sap (if ever it had any) has become, in
a manner, dried up and extinct; and you will find your old associate, in
his second volume, dwindled into prose and <emphasis>criticism</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Am I right in assuming this as the cause? or is it that, as years come
upon us, (except with some more healthy-happy spirits,) Life itself
loses much of its Poetry for us? we transcribe but what we read in the
great volume of Nature; and, as the characters grow dim, we turn off,
and look another way. You yourself write no Christabels, nor Ancient
Mariners, now.</p>
<p>Some of the Sonnets, which shall be carelessly turned over by the
general reader, may happily awaken in you remembrances, which I should
be sorry should be ever totally extinct—the memory</p>
<p>        Of summer days and of delightful years—</p>
<p>even so far back as to those old suppers at our old ****** Inn,—when life
was fresh, and topics exhaustless,—and you first kindled in me, if not
the power, yet the love of poetry, and beauty, and kindliness.—</p>
<p>            What words have I heard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Spoke at the Mermaid!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The world has given you many a shrewd nip and gird since that time, but
either my eyes are grown dimmer, or my old friend is the <emphasis>same</emphasis>, who
stood before me three and twenty years ago—his hair a little confessing
the hand of time, but still shrouding the same capacious brain,—his
heart not altered, scarcely where it "alteration finds."</p>
<p>One piece, Coleridge, I have ventured to publish in its original form,
though I have heard you complain of a certain over-imitation of the
antique in the style. If I could see any way of getting rid of the
objection, without re-writing it entirely, I would make some sacrifices.
But when I wrote John Woodvil, I never proposed to myself any distinct
deviation from common English. I had been newly initiated in the
writings of our elder dramatists; Beaumont and Fletcher, and Massinger,
were then a <emphasis>first love</emphasis>; and from what I was so freshly conversant in,
what wonder if my language imperceptibly took a tinge? The very <emphasis>time</emphasis>,
which I have chosen for my story, that which immediately followed the
Restoration, seemed to require, in an English play, that the English
should be of rather an older cast, than that of the precise year in
which it happened to be written. I wish it had not some faults, which I
can less vindicate than the language.</p>
<p>I remain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  My dear Coleridge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Your's,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<p>                          (1789)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        What time in bands of slumber all were laid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To Death's dark court, methought I was convey'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In realms it lay far hid from mortal sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And gloomy tapers scarce kept out the night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        On ebon throne the King of Terrors sate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Around him stood the ministers of Fate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        On fell destruction bent, the murth'rous band</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Waited attentively his high command.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Here pallid Fear &amp; dark Despair were seen.</p>
<empty-line/>

        And Fever here with looks forever lean,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Swoln Dropsy, halting Gout, profuse of woes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And Madness fierce &amp; hopeless of repose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Wide-wasting Plague; but chief in honour stood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        More-wasting War, insatiable of blood;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With starting eye-balls, eager for the word;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Already brandish'd was the glitt'ring sword.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Wonder and fear alike had fill'd my breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And thus the grisly Monarch I addrest—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "Of earth-born Heroes why should Poets sing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And thee neglect, neglect the greatest King?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To thee ev'n Caesar's self was forc'd to yield</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The glories of Pharsalia's well-fought field."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        When, with a frown, "Vile caitiff, come not here,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Abrupt cried Death; "shall flatt'ry soothe my ear?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "Hence, or thou feel'st my dart!" the Monarch said.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wild terror seiz'd me, &amp; the vision fled.</p>

<p>        As when a child on some long winter's night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Affrighted clinging to its Grandam's knees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With eager wond'ring and perturb'd delight</p>

        Listens strange tales of fearful dark decrees</p>

        Mutter'd to wretch by necromantic spell;</p>

        Or of those hags, who at the witching time</p>

<p>

        Of murky midnight ride the air sublime,</p>

<p>

        And mingle foul embrace with fiends of Hell:</p>

<p>        Was it some sweet device of Faery</p>

<p>

        That mocked my steps with many a lonely glade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And fancied wanderings with a fair-hair'd maid?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Have these things been? or what rare witchery,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Impregning with delights the charmed air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Enlighted up the semblance of a smile</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In those fine eyes? methought they spake the while</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Soft soothing things, which might enforce despair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To drop the murdering knife, and let go by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His foul resolve. And does the lonely glade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Still court the foot-steps of the fair-hair'd maid?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Still in her locks the gales of summer sigh?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        While I forlorn do wander reckless where,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And 'mid my wanderings meet no Anna there.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>        (<emphasis>Probably</emphasis> 1795. <emphasis>Text of</emphasis> 1818)</p>
<p>        Methinks how dainty sweet it were, reclin'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Beneath the vast out-stretching branches high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of some old wood, in careless sort to lie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Nor of the busier scenes we left behind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Aught envying. And, O Anna! mild-eyed maid!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Beloved! I were well content to play</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With thy free tresses all a summer's day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Losing the time beneath the greenwood shade.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or we might sit and tell some tender tale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of faithful vows repaid by cruel scorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A tale of true love, or of friend forgot;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And I would teach thee, lady, how to rail</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In gentle sort, on those who practise not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or love or pity, though of woman born.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>        (1794. <emphasis>Text of</emphasis> 1818)</p>
<p>        O! I could laugh to hear the midnight wind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That, rushing on its way with careless sweep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Scatters the ocean waves. And I could weep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Like to a child. For now to my raised mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        On wings of winds comes wild-eyed Phantasy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And her rude visions give severe delight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O winged bark! how swift along the night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Pass'd thy proud keel! nor shall I let go by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Lightly of that drear hour the memory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When wet and chilly on thy deck I stood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Unbonnetted, and gazed upon the flood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Even till it seemed a pleasant thing to die,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To be resolv'd into th' elemental wave,</p>

        Or take my portion with the winds that rave.</p>

<p><strong>FROM CHARLES LLOYD'S POEMS ON THE DEATH OF PRISCILLA FARMER, 1796</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                      THE GRANDAME</strong></p>
<p>        (Summer, 1796. Text of 1818)</p>
<p>        On the green hill top,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hard by the house of prayer, a modest roof,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And not distinguish'd from its neighbour-barn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Save by a slender-tapering length of spire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The Grandame sleeps.  A plain stone barely tells</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The name and date to the chance passenger.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For lowly born was she, and long had eat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Well-earned, the bread of service:—her's was else</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A mounting spirit, one that entertained</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Scorn of base action, deed dishonorable,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or aught unseemly. I remember well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Her reverend image: I remember, too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With what a zeal she served her master's house;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And how the prattling tongue of garrulous age</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Delighted to recount the oft-told tale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or anecdote domestic. Wise she was,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And wondrous skilled in genealogies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And could in apt and voluble terms discourse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of births, of titles, and alliances;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of marriages, and intermarriages;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Relationship remote, or near of kin;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of friends offended, family disgraced—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Maiden high-born, but wayward, disobeying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Parental strict injunction, and regardless</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of unmixed blood, and ancestry remote,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Stooping to wed with one of low degree.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But these are not thy praises; and I wrong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thy honor'd memory, recording chiefly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Things light or trivial. Better 'twere to tell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        How with a nobler zeal, and warmer love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        She served her <emphasis>heavenly master</emphasis>. I have seen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That reverend form bent down with age and pain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And rankling malady. Yet not for this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ceased she to praise her maker, or withdrew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Her trust in him, her faith, and humble hope—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So meekly had she learn'd to bear her cross—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For she had studied patience in the school</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of Christ, much comfort she had thence derived,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And was a follower of the NAZARENE.</p>

        A look whereof might heal the cruel smart</p>

        Might to sweet deeds of mercy move the heart</p>

<p>        In my poor mind it is most sweet to muse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Upon the days gone by; to act in thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Past seasons o'er, and be again a child;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To sit in fancy on the turf-clad slope,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Down which the child would roll; to pluck gay flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Make posies in the sun, which the child's hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        (Childhood offended soon, soon reconciled,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Would throw away, and strait take up again,</p>
<empty-line/>

        Then fling them to the winds, and o'er the lawn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Bound with so playful and so light a foot,</p>

        That the press'd daisy scarce declined her head.</p>

<p>        The cheerful sabbath bells, wherever heard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Strike pleasant on the sense, most like the voice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of one, who from the far-off hills proclaims</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Tidings of good to Zion: chiefly when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Their piercing tones fall <emphasis>sudden</emphasis> on the ear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of the contemplant, solitary man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whom thoughts abstruse or high have chanced to lure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Forth from the walks of men, revolving oft,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And oft again, hard matter, which eludes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And baffles his pursuit—thought-sick and tired</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of controversy, where no end appears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        No clue to his research, the lonely man</p>

        Half wishes for society again.</p>

        Him, thus engaged, the sabbath bells salute</p>
<empty-line/>

        <emphasis>Sudden!</emphasis> his heart awakes, his ears drink in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The cheering music; his relenting soul</p>

<p>

        Yearns after all the joys of social life,</p>

        To the steep rock's fearful side</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Fast the frantic Mother hied—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        O'er her blooming warrior dead</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Many a tear did Scotland shed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And shrieks of long and loud lament</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From her Grampian hills she sent.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

        To do observance at the tomb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Where the son of Douglas lay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Round about the tomb did go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In solemn state and order slow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Silent pace, and black attire,</p>
<empty-line/>

        The blood of Douglas' noble race.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        With them the flower of minstrels came,</p>

<p>

        And to their cunning harps did frame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In doleful numbers piercing rhymes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Such strains as in the older times</p>
<empty-line/>

        Had sooth'd the spirit of Fingal,</p>

<p>        "Scottish maidens, drop a tear</p>

<p><strong>               TO CHARLES LLOYD</strong></p>
<p>           <emphasis>An Unexpected Visitor</emphasis></p>
<p>        (<emphasis>January, 1797. Text of 1818</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Alone, obscure, without a friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A cheerless, solitary thing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Why seeks, my Lloyd, the stranger out?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          What offering can the stranger bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Of social scenes, home-bred delights,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That him in aught compensate may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For Stowey's pleasant winter nights,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For loves and friendships far away?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        In brief oblivion to forego</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Friends, such as thine, so justly dear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And be awhile with me content</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To stay, a kindly loiterer, here:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        For this a gleam of random joy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Hath flush'd my unaccustom'd cheek;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And, with an o'er-charg'd bursting heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I feel the thanks I cannot speak.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Oh! sweet are all the Muses' lays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And sweet the charm of matin bird;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Twas long since these estranged ears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The sweeter voice of friend had heard.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        The voice hath spoke: the pleasant sounds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In memory's ear in after time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Shall live, to sometimes rouse a tear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And sometimes prompt an honest rhyme.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        For, when the transient charm is fled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And when the little week is o'er,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To cheerless, friendless, solitude</p>
<empty-line/>

          When I return, as heretofore,</p>

<p>        Long, long, within my aching heart</p>
<empty-line/>

<p><strong>                A VISION OF REPENTANCE</strong></p>
<p>        (<emphasis>1796? Text of 1818</emphasis>)</p>
<p>        I saw a famous fountain, in my dream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Where shady path-ways to a valley led;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A weeping willow lay upon that stream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And all around the fountain brink were spread</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wide branching trees, with dark green leaf rich clad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Forming a doubtful twilight-desolate and sad.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        The place was such, that whoso enter'd in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Disrobed was of every earthly thought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And straight became as one that knew not sin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or to the world's first innocence was brought;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Enseem'd it now, he stood on holy ground,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In sweet and tender melancholy wrapt around.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        A most strange calm stole o'er my soothed sprite;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Long time I stood, and longer had I staid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When, lo! I saw, saw by the sweet moon-light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Which came in silence o'er that silent shade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where, near the fountain, SOMETHING like DESPAIR</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Made, of that weeping willow, garlands for her hair.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        And eke with painful fingers she inwove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Many an uncouth stem of savage thorn—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "The willow garland, <emphasis>that</emphasis> was for her love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And <emphasis>these</emphasis> her bleeding temples would adorn."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With sighs her heart nigh burst, salt tears fast fell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As mournfully she bended o'er that sacred well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        To whom when I addrest myself to speak,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          She lifted up her eyes, and nothing said;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The delicate red came mantling o'er her cheek,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And, gath'ring up her loose attire, she fled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To the dark covert of that woody shade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And in her goings seem'd a timid gentle maid.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Revolving in my mind what this should mean,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And why that lovely lady plained so;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Perplex'd in thought at that mysterious scene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And doubting if 'twere best to stay or go,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I cast mine eyes in wistful gaze around,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When from the shades came slow a small and plaintive sound:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "PSYCHE am I, who love to dwell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In these brown shades, this woody dell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where never busy mortal came,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Till now, to pry upon my shame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "At thy feet what thou dost see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The waters of repentance be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which, night and day, I must augment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With tears, like a true penitent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "If haply so my day of grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Be not yet past; and this lone place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O'er-shadowy, dark, excludeth hence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All thoughts but grief and penitence."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        <emphasis>"Why dost thou weep, thou gentle maid!</emphasis></p>

        Thy hidden thoughts with sorrow feed?</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

        Can thing so fair repentance need?"</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>

        Deem'd lightly of that sacred tie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Gave to a treacherous WORLD my heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And play'd the foolish wanton's part.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "Soon to these murky shades I came,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To hide from the sun's light my shame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And still I haunt this woody dell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And bathe me in that healing well,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whose waters clear have influence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From sin's foul stains the soul to cleanse;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And, night and day, I them augment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With tears, like a true penitent,</p>

        Until, due expiation made,</p>

<p>

        Shall chaunt the extatic marriage hymn."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "Now Christ restore thee soon "—I said,</p>

          My joys, my sorrows, thou with me hast shar'd</p>

        When care sits, cloudy, on the brow of youth;</p>

        When bitter griefs the female bosom swell,</p>

<p><strong>                    TO CHARLES LLOYD</strong></p>
<p>        A stranger, and alone, I past those scenes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        We past so late together; and my heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Felt something like desertion, when I look'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Around me, and the well-known voice of friend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Was absent, and the cordial look was there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        No more to smile on me. I thought on Lloyd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All he had been to me. And now I go</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Again to mingle with a world impure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With men who make a mock of holy things</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Mistaken, and of man's best hope think scorn.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The world does much to warp the heart of man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And I may sometimes join its ideot laugh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of this I now complain not. Deal with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Omniscient Father! as thou judgest best,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And in thy season <emphasis>tender</emphasis> thou my heart.</p>
<empty-line/>

        I pray not for myself; I pray for him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whose soul is sore perplex'd: shine thou on him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Father of Lights! and in the difficult paths</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Make plain his way before him. His own thoughts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        May he not think, his own ends not pursue;</p>

        So shall he best perform thy will on earth.</p>

<p>        Thou too art dead, ——! very kind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hast thou been to me in my childish days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thou best good creature. I have not forgot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        How thou didst love thy Charles, when he was yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A prating schoolboy: I have not forgot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The busy joy on that important day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When, child-like, the poor wanderer was content</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To leave the bosom of parental love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His childhood's play-place, and his early home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For the rude fosterings of a stranger's hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hard uncouth tasks, and school-boy's scanty fare.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        How did thine eye peruse him round and round,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And hardly know him in his yellow coats[3],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Red leathern belt, and gown of russet blue!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Farewell, good aunt!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Go thou, and occupy the same grave-bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where the dead mother lies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Oh my dear mother, oh thou dear dead saint!</p>
<empty-line/>

        A mother's smile, to think her son should thrive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In this bad world, when she was dead and gone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And when a tear hath sat (take shame, O son!)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When that same child has prov'd himself unkind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        One parent yet is left—a wretched thing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A sad survivor of his buried wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A palsy-smitten, childish, old, old man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A semblance most forlorn of what he was,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A merry cheerful man. A merrier man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A man more apt to frame matter for mirth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Mad jokes, and anticks for a Christmas eve;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Making life social, and the laggard time</p>

        Thy servants in far worse, in spiritual death!</p>

        And darkness blacker than those feared shadows</p>

        With which the world has pierc'd us thro' and thro'.</p>

<p><strong>                THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES</strong></p>
<p>        (<emphasis>January</emphasis>, 1798. <emphasis>Text of</emphasis> 1818)</p>
<p>        I have had playmates, I have had companions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In my days of childhood, in my joyful school-days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        I have been laughing, I have been carousing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Drinking late, sitting late, with my bosom cronies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        I loved a love once, fairest among women;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Closed are her doors on me, I must not see her—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        I have a friend, a kinder friend has no man;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Like an ingrate, I left my friend abruptly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Left him, to muse on the old familiar faces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Ghost-like, I paced round the haunts of my childhood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Earth seemed a desart I was bound to traverse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Seeking to find the old familiar faces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Friend of my bosom, thou more than a brother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Why wert not thou born in my father's dwelling?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So might we talk of the old familiar faces—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        How some they have died, and some they have left me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And some are taken from me; all are departed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>

<p><strong>                  COMPOSED AT MIDNIGHT</strong></p>
<p>        (1797? <emphasis>Text of</emphasis> 1818)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        From broken visions of perturbed rest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I wake, and start, and fear to sleep again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        How total a privation of all sounds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Sights, and familiar objects, man, bird, beast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Herb, tree, or flower, and prodigal light of heaven.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Twere some relief to catch the drowsy cry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of the mechanic watchman, or the noise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of revel reeling home from midnight cups.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Those are the moanings of the dying man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who lies in the upper chamber; restless moans,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And interrupted only by a cough</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Consumptive, torturing the wasted lungs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So in the bitterness of death he lies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And waits in anguish for the morning's light.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        What can that do for him, or what restore?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Short taste, faint sense, affecting notices,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And little images of pleasures past,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of health, and active life—health not yet slain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Nor the other grace of life, a good name, sold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For sin's black wages. On his tedious bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He writhes, and turns him from the accusing light,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And finds no comfort in the sun, but says</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "When night comes I shall get a little rest."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Some few groans more, death comes, and there an end.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Tis darkness and conjecture all beyond;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Weak Nature fears, though Charity must hope,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And Fancy, most licentious on such themes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where decent reverence well had kept her mute,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hath o'er-stock'd hell with devils, and brought down,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        By her enormous fablings and mad lies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Discredit on the gospel's serious truths</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And salutary fears. The man of parts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Poet, or prose declaimer, on his couch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Lolling, like one indifferent, fabricates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A heaven of gold, where he, and such as he,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Their heads encompassed with crowns, their heels</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With fine wings garlanded, shall tread the stars</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Beneath their feet, heaven's pavement, far removed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From damned spirits, and the torturing cries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of men, his breth'ren, fashioned of the earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As he was, nourish'd with the self-same bread,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Belike his kindred or companions once—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Through everlasting ages now divorced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In chains and savage torments to repent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Short years of folly on earth. Their groans unheard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In heav'n, the saint nor pity feels, nor care,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For those thus sentenced—pity might disturb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The delicate sense and most divine repose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of spirits angelical. Blessed be God,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The measure of his judgments is not fixed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        By man's erroneous standard. He discerns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        No such inordinate difference and vast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Betwixt the sinner and the saint, to doom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Such disproportion'd fates. Compared with him,</p>
<empty-line/>

        No man on earth is holy called: they best</p>

<p>

        Stand in his sight approved, who at his feet</p>
<empty-line/>

        Their little crowns of virtue cast, and yield</p>

<p>        High-born Helen, round your dwelling</p>

          These twenty years I've paced in vain:</p>

        Haughty beauty, thy lover's duty</p>

          Hath been to glory in his pain.</p>

        I starve, I die, now you comply,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And I no longer can complain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        These twenty years I've lived on tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Dwelling for ever on a frown;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        On sighs I've fed, your scorn my bread;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I perish now you kind are grown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Can I, who loved my beloved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But for the scorn "was in her eye,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Can I be moved for my beloved,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          When she "returns me sigh for sigh?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        In stately pride, by my bed-side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          High-born Helen's portrait's hung;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Deaf to my praise, my mournful lays</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Are nightly to the portrait sung.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        To that I weep, nor ever sleep,</p>
<empty-line/>

          Complaining all night long to her—</p>

<p>        In a costly palace Youth goes clad in gold;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In a wretched workhouse Age's limbs are cold:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        There they sit, the old men by a shivering fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Still close and closer cowering, warmth is their desire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        In a costly palace, when the brave gallants dine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They have store of good venison, with old canary wine,</p>

        With singing and music to heighten the cheer;</p>

        By a train of attendants which laugh at my young Lord's jest;</p>

        In a wretched workhouse the contrary prevails:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Does Age begin to prattle?—no man heark'neth to his tales.</p>

<p>        In a costly palace if the child with a pin</p>

<p>

        Do but chance to prick a finger, strait the doctor is called in;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In a wretched workhouse men are left to perish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For want of proper cordials, which their old age might cherish,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        In a costly palace Youth enjoys his lust;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In a wretched workhouse Age, in corners thrust,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thinks upon the former days, when he was well to do,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Had children to stand by him, both friends and kinsmen too.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        In a costly palace Youth his temples hides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With a new devised peruke that reaches to his sides;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In a wretched workhouse Age's crown is bare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With a few thin locks just to fence out the cold air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        In peace, as in war, 'tis our young gallants' pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To walk, each one i' the streets, with a rapier by his side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That none to do them injury may have pretence;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wretched Age, in poverty, must brook offence.</p>

<p>              A FAREWELL TO TOBACCO</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          (1805)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          May the Babylonish curse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Strait confound my stammering verse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          If I can a passage see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In this word-perplexity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or a fit expression find,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or a language to my mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          (Still the phrase is wide or scant)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To take leave of thee, GREAT PLANT!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or in any terms relate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Half my love, or half my hate:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For I hate, yet love, thee so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That, whichever thing I shew,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The plain truth will seem to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A constrain'd hyperbole,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And the passion to proceed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          More from a mistress than a weed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Sooty retainer to the vine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Bacchus' black servant, negro fine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Sorcerer, that mak'st us dote upon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Thy begrimed complexion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And, for thy pernicious sake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          More and greater oaths to break</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Than reclaimed lovers take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          'Gainst women: thou thy siege dost lay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Much too in the female way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          While thou suck'st the lab'ring breath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Faster than kisses or than death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          Thou in such a cloud dost bind us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That our worst foes cannot find us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And ill fortune, that would thwart us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Shoots at rovers, shooting at us;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          While each man, thro' thy height'ning steam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Does like a smoking Etna seem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And all about us does express</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          (Fancy and wit in richest dress)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A Sicilian fruitfulness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Thou through such a mist dost shew us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That our best friends do not know us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And, for those allowed features,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Due to reasonable creatures,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Liken'st us to fell Chimeras,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Monsters that, who see us, fear us;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Worse than Cerberus or Geryon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or, who first lov'd a cloud, Ixion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Bacchus we know, and we allow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          His tipsy rites. But what art thou,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That but by reflex can'st shew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          What his deity can do,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          As the false Egyptian spell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Aped the true Hebrew miracle?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Some few vapours thou may'st raise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The weak brain may serve to amaze,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But to the reigns and nobler heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Can'st nor life nor heat impart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Brother of Bacchus, later born,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The old world was sure forlorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Wanting thee, that aidest more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The god's victories than before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          All his panthers, and the brawls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Of his piping Bacchanals.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          These, as stale, we disallow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or judge of <emphasis>thee</emphasis> meant; only thou</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          His true Indian conquest art;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And, for ivy round his dart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The reformed god now weaves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A finer thyrsus of thy leaves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Scent to match thy rich perfume</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Chemic art did ne'er presume</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Through her quaint alembic strain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          None so sov'reign to the brain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Nature, that did in thee excel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Fram'd again no second smell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Roses, violets, but toys</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For the smaller sort of boys,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or for greener damsels meant;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Thou art the only manly scent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Stinking'st of the stinking kind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Filth of the mouth and fog of the mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Africa, that brags her foyson,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Breeds no such prodigious poison,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Henbane, nightshade, both together,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Hemlock, aconite———</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>              Nay, rather,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Plant divine, of rarest virtue;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Blisters on the tongue would hurt you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          'Twas but in a sort I blam'd thee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          None e'er prosper'd who defam'd thee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Irony all, and feign'd abuse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Such as perplext lovers use,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          At a need, when, in despair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To paint forth their fairest fair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or in part but to express</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That exceeding comeliness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Which their fancies doth so strike,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          They borrow language of dislike;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And, instead of Dearest Miss,</p>

          Jewel, Honey, Sweetheart, Bliss,</p>

          And those forms of old admiring,</p>

          Friendly Trait'ress, loving Foe,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Not that she is truly so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But no other way they know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A contentment to express,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Borders so upon excess,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That they do not rightly wot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Whether it be pain or not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            Or, as men, constrain'd to part</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          With what's nearest to their heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          While their sorrow's at the height,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Lose discrimination quite,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And their hasty wrath let fall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To appease their frantic gall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          On the darling thing whatever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Whence they feel it death to sever,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Though it be, as they, perforce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Guiltless of the sad divorce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          For I must (nor let it grieve thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Friendliest of plants, that I must) leave thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For thy sake, TOBACCO, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Would do any thing but die,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And but seek to extend my days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Long enough to sing thy praise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But, as she, who once hath been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A king's consort, is a queen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Ever after, nor will bate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Any tittle of her state,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Though a widow, or divorced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          So I, from thy converse forced,</p>

          The old name and style retain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A right Katherine of Spain;</p>

          And a seat, too,'mongst the joys</p>

          Of the blest Tobacco Boys;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Where, though I, by sour physician,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Am debarr'd the full fruition</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Of thy favours, I may catch</p>

          Some collateral sweets, and snatch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Sidelong odours, that give life</p>
<empty-line/>

          Like glances from a neighbour's wife;</p>
<empty-line/>

          And still live in the by-places</p>

<p>   (<emphasis>By Mary Lamb. Probably</emphasis> 1808 <emphasis>or</emphasis> 1809)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Once on a charger there was laid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And brought before a royal maid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As price of attitude and grace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A guiltless head, a holy face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          It was on Herod's natal day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who, o'er Judea's land held sway.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He married his own brother's wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wicked Herodias. She the life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of John the Baptist long had sought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Because he openly had taught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That she a life unlawful led,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Having her husband's brother wed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          This was he, that saintly John,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who in the wilderness alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Abiding, did for clothing wear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A garment made of camel's hair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Honey and locusts were his food,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And he was most severely good.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He preached penitence and tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And waking first the sinner's fears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Prepared a path, made smooth a way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For his diviner master's day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          Herod kept in princely state</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His birth-day. On his throne he sate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        After the feast, beholding her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who danced with grace peculiar;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Fair Salome, who did excel</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All in that land for dancing well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The feastful monarch's heart was fired,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And whatsoe'er thing she desired.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Though half his kingdom it should be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He in his pleasure swore that he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Would give the graceful Salome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The damsel was Herodias' daughter:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        She to the queen hastes, and besought her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To teach her what great gift to name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Instructed by Herodias, came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The damsel back; to Herod said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "Give me John the Baptist's head;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And in a charger let it be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hither straitway brought to me."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Herod her suit would fain deny,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But for his oath's sake must comply.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          When painters would by art express</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Beauty in unloveliness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thee, Herodias' daughter, thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They fittest subject take to be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They give thy form and features grace;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But ever in thy beauteous face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They shew a steadfast cruel gaze,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        An eye unpitying; and amaze</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In all beholders deep they mark,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That thou betrayest not one spark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of feeling for the ruthless deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That did thy praiseful dance succeed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For on the head they make you look,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As if a sullen joy you took,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A cruel triumph, wicked pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That for your sport a saint had died.</p>

<p>    The Lady Blanch, regardless of all her lovers' fears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To the Urs'line convent hastens, and long the Abbess hears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    "O Blanch, my child, repent ye of the courtly life ye lead."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Blanch looked on a rose-bud and little seem'd to heed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    She looked on the rose-bud, she looked round, and thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On all her heart had whisper'd, and all the Nun had taught.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    "I am worshipped by lovers, and brightly shines my fame,</p>

    All Christendom resoundeth the noble Blanch's name.</p>
<empty-line/>

    But when the sculptur'd marble is raised o'er my head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And the matchless Blanch lies lifeless among the noble dead,</p>
<empty-line/>

      And swears that thou art such a one as he,</p>

<p>

      Warm, laughter-loving, with a touch of madness,</p>

      Wild, glee-provoking, pouring oil of gladness</p>

      From frank heart without guile. And, if thou be</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

          In vests of pure Baptismal white,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The Mother to the Font doth bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The little helpless nameless thing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          With hushes soft and mild caressing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          At once to get—a name and blessing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Close by the Babe the Priest doth stand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The Cleansing Water at his hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Which must assoil the soul within</p>
<empty-line/>

          From every stain of Adam's sin.</p>

          The Infant eyes the mystic scenes,</p>
<empty-line/>

          Nor knows what all this wonder means;</p>

          Now frighted clings to Nurse's hold,</p>

          Enough for him, in after-times,</p>

<p><strong>          ON AN INFANT DYING AS SOON AS BORN</strong></p>
<p>                        (1827)</p>
<p>          I saw where in the shroud did lurk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A curious frame of Nature's work.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A flow'ret crushed in the bud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A nameless piece of Babyhood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Was in a cradle-coffin lying;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Extinct, with scarce the sense of dying;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          So soon to exchange the imprisoning womb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For darker closets of the tomb!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          She did but ope an eye, and put</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A clear beam forth, then strait up shut</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For the long dark: ne'er more to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Through glasses of mortality.</p>

          What thy short visit meant, or know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          What thy errand here below?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Shall we say, that Nature blind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Check'd her hand, and changed her mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Just when she had exactly wrought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A finish'd pattern without fault?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Could she flag, or could she tire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or lack'd she the Promethean fire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          (With her nine moons' long workings sicken'd)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That should thy little limbs have quicken'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Limbs so firm, they seem'd to assure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Life of health, and days mature:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Woman's self in miniature!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Limbs so fair, they might supply</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          (Themselves now but cold imagery)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The sculptor to make Beauty by.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or did the stern-eyed Fate descry,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That babe, or mother, one must die;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          So in mercy left the stock,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And cut the branch; to save the shock</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Of young years widow'd; and the pain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          When Single State comes back again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To the lone man who, 'reft of wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Thenceforward drags a maimed life?</p>

<p>          When last you left your Woodbridge pretty,</p>
<empty-line/>

          To stare at sights, and see the City,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          If I your meaning understood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          You wish'd a Picture, cheap, but good;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The colouring? decent; clear, not muddy;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To suit a Poet's quiet study,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Where Books and Prints for delectation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Hang, rather than vain ostentation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The subject? what I pleased, if comely;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But something scriptural and homely:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A sober Piece, not gay or wanton,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For winter fire-sides to descant on;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The theme so scrupulously handled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A Quaker might look on unscandal'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Such as might satisfy Ann Knight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And classic Mitford just not fright.</p>
<empty-line/>

          Just such a one I've found, and send it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          If liked, I give—if not, but lend it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The moral? nothing can be sounder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The fable? 'tis its own expounder—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          A Mother teaching to her Chit</p>

          Some good book, and explaining it.</p>

          He, silly urchin, tired of lesson,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          His learning lays no mighty stress on,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But seems to hear not what he hears;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Thrusting his fingers in his ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Like Obstinate, that perverse funny one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In honest parable of Bunyan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          His working Sister, more sedate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Listens; but in a kind of state,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The painter meant for steadiness;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But has a tinge of sullenness;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And, at first sight, she seems to brook</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          As ill her needle, as he his book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          This is the Picture. For the Frame—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          'Tis not ill-suited to the same;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Oak-carved, not gilt, for fear of falling;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Old-fashion'd; plain, yet not appalling;</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

        Young, but no more a child. How swift have flown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To me thy girlish times, a woman grown</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Beneath my heedless eyes! in vain I rack</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        My fancy to believe the almanac,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That speaks thee Twenty-One. Thou should'st have still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Remain'd a child, and at thy sovereign will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Gambol'd about our house, as in times past.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ungrateful Emma, to grow up so fast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hastening to leave thy friends!—for which intent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Fond Runagate, be this thy punishment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        After some thirty years, spent in such bliss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As this earth can afford, where still we miss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Something of joy entire, may'st thou grow old</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As we whom thou hast left! That wish was cold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O far more ag'd and wrinkled, till folks say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Looking upon thee reverend in decay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "This Dame for length of days, and virtues rare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With her respected Grandsire may compare."—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Grandchild of that respected Isola,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thou should'st have had about thee on this day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Kind looks of Parents, to congratulate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Their Pride grown up to woman's grave estate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But they have died, and left thee, to advance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thy fortunes how thou may'st, and owe to chance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The friends which Nature grudg'd. And thou wilt find,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or make such, Emma, if I am not blind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To thee and thy deservings. That last strain</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Had too much sorrow in it. Fill again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Another cheerful goblet, while I say</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

        Much fairer damsels have I known, and know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And richer may be found in every place.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In thy <emphasis>mind</emphasis> seek thy beauty, and thy wealth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Sincereness lodgeth there, the soul's best health.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O guard that treasure above gold or pearl,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Laid up secure from moths and worldly stealth—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And take my benison, plain-hearted girl.</p>

<p>

        The fair Maria, as a vestal, still;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And Emma brown, exuberant in talk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With soft and Lady speech the first applies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The mild correctives that to grace belong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To her redundant friend, who her defies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With jest, and mad discourse, and bursts of song.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O differing Pair, yet sweetly thus agreeing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        What music from your happy discord rises,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        While your companion hearing each, and seeing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Nor this, nor that, but both together, prizes;</p>
<empty-line/>

        This lesson teaching, which our souls may strike,</p>

        But slightly, who have died, your Brother's loss</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>                          (1820)</p>
<p>        Poor Irus' faithful wolf-dog here I lie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That wont to tend my old blind master's steps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His guide and guard; nor, while my service lasted,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Had he occasion for that staff, with which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He now goes picking out his path in fear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Over the highways and crossings, but would plant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Safe in the conduct of my friendly string,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A firm foot forward still, till he had reach'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His poor seat on some stone, nigh where the tide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of passers-by in thickest confluence flow'd:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To whom with loud and passionate laments</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From morn to eve his dark estate he wail'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Nor wail'd to all in vain: some here and there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The well disposed and good, their pennies gave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I meantime at his feet obsequious slept;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Not all-asleep in sleep, but heart and ear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Prick'd up at his least motion, to receive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        At his kind hand my customary crumbs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And common portion in his feast of scraps;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or when night warn'd us homeward, tired and spent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With our long day, and tedious beggary.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        These were my manners, this my way of life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Till age and slow disease me overtook,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And sever'd from my sightless master's side.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But lest the grace of so good deeds should die,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Through tract of years in mute oblivion lost,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        This slender tomb of turf hath Irus rear'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Cheap monument of no ungrudging hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And with short verse inscribed it, to attest,</p>

<p><strong>                    THE BALLAD SINGERS</strong></p>
<p>        Where seven fair Streets to one tall Column[8] draw,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Two Nymphs have ta'en their stand, in hats of straw;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Their yellower necks huge beads of amber grace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And by their trade they're of the Sirens' race:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With cloak loose-pinn'd on each, that has been red,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But long with dust and dirt discoloured</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Belies its hue; in mud behind, before,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From heel to middle leg becrusted o'er.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        One a small infant at the breast does bear;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And one in her right hand her tuneful ware,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which she would vend. Their station scarce is taken,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When youths and maids flock round. His stall forsaken,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Forth comes a Son of Crispin, leathern-capt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Prepared to buy a ballad, if one apt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To move his fancy offers. Crispin's sons</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Have, from uncounted time, with ale and buns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Cherish'd the gift of <emphasis>Song</emphasis>, which sorrow quells;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And, working single in their low-rooft cells,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Oft cheat the tedium of a winter's night</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With anthems warbled in the Muses' spight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who now hath caught the alarm? the Servant Maid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hath heard a buzz at distance; and, afraid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To miss a note, with elbows red comes out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Leaving his forge to cool, Pyracmon stout</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thrusts in his unwash'd visage. <emphasis>He</emphasis> stands by,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who the hard trade of Porterage does ply</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With stooping shoulders. What cares he? he sees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The assembled ring, nor heeds his tottering knees,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But pricks his ears up with the hopes of song.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So, while the Bard of Rhodope his wrong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Bewail'd to Proserpine on Thracian strings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The tasks of gloomy Orcus lost their stings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And stone-vext Sysiphus forgets his load.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Hither and thither from the sevenfold road</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Some cart or waggon crosses, which divides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The close-wedged audience; but, as when the tides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To ploughing ships give way, the ship being past,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They re-unite, so these unite as fast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The older Songstress hitherto hath spent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Her elocution in the argument</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of their great Song in <emphasis>prose</emphasis>; to wit, the woes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which Maiden true to faithless Sailor owes—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ah! "<emphasis>Wandering He</emphasis>!"—which now in loftier <emphasis>verse</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Pathetic they alternately rehearse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All gaping wait the event. This Critic opes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His right ear to the strain. The other hopes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To catch it better with his left. Long trade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        It were to tell, how the deluded Maid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A victim fell. And now right greedily</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All hands are stretching forth the songs to buy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That are so tragical; which She, and She,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Deals out, and <emphasis>sings the while</emphasis>; nor can there be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A breast so obdurate here, that will hold back</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His contribution from the gentle rack</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of Music's pleasing torture. Irus' self,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The staff-propt Beggar, his thin-gotten pelf</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Brings out from pouch, where squalid farthings rest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And boldly claims his ballad with the best.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        An old Dame only lingers. To her purse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The penny sticks. At length, with harmless curse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "Give me," she cries. "I'll paste it on my wall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        While the wall lasts, to show what ills befal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Fond hearts seduced from Innocency's way;</p>
<empty-line/>

        Pored on the pictured wonders[13] thou hadst done:</p>

        All Fielding's, Smollett's heroes, rose to view;</p>

        Did o'er my raw credulity prevail,</p>

<p>

        Where Glums and Gawries wear mysterious things,</p>

        But heightens thine, and thy free draught refines.</p>

<p>        What makes a happy wedlock? What has fate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Not given to thee in thy well-chosen mate?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Good sense—good humour;—these are trivial things,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Dear M——, that each trite encomiast sings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But she hath these, and more. A mind exempt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From every low-bred passion, where contempt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Nor envy, nor detraction, ever found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A harbour yet; an understanding sound;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Just views of right and wrong; perception full</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of the deformed, and of the beautiful,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In life and manners; wit above her sex,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which, as a gem, her sprightly converse decks;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Exuberant fancies, prodigal of mirth,</p>
<empty-line/>

        To gladden woodland walk, or winter hearth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A noble nature, conqueror in the strife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of conflict with a hard discouraging life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Strengthening the veins of virtue, past the power</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of those whose days have been one silken hour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Spoil'd fortune's pamper'd offspring; a keen sense</p>

        Alike of benefit, and of offence,</p>

        With reconcilement quick, that instant springs</p>

        While grateful feelings, like a signet sign'd</p>

        By a strong hand, seem burnt into her mind.</p>

<p>        I had a sense in dreams of a beauty rare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whom Fate had spell-bound, and rooted there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Stooping, like some enchanted theme,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Over the marge of that crystal stream,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where the blooming Greek, to Echo blind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With Self-love fond, had to waters pined.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ages had waked, and ages slept,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And that bending posture still she kept:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For her eyes she may not turn away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Till a fairer object shall pass that way—</p>

        'Till an image more beauteous this world can show,</p>

        I knew you once a romping child,</p>

        Obstreperous much and very wild.</p>

<p>                             (1834)</p>
<p>[In a leaf of a quarto edition of the 'Lives of the Saints, written in
Spanish by the learned and reverend father, Alfonso Villegas, Divine, of
the order of St. Dominick, set forth in English by John Heigham, Anno
1630,' bought at a Catholic book-shop in Duke Street, Lincoln's Inn
Fields, I found, carefully inserted, a painted flower, seemingly coeval
with the book itself; and did not, for some time, discover that it
opened in the middle, and was the cover to a very humble draught of a
St. Anne, with the Virgin and Child; doubtless the performance of some
poor but pious Catholic, whose meditations it assisted.]</p>

<p>          Some cry up Haydn, some Mozart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Just as the whim bites; for my part,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I do not care a farthing candle</p>

          Or thro' the world with comfort go,</p>

          That never heard of Doctor Blow?</p>
<empty-line/>

          So help me heaven, I hardly have;</p>

          And know no more of stave or crotchet,</p>

          By stroke on anvil, or by summ'at,</p>

          Found out, to his great surprise, the gamut.</p>

          I care no more for Cimarosa,</p>

<p>

          Being no painter; and bad luck</p>

          All men are false, I think. The date of love</p>

<p>

          Is out, expired, its stories all grown stale,</p>

          O'er past, forgotten, like an antique tale</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

            JOHN WOODVIL.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          All are not false. I knew a youth who died</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For grief, because his Love proved so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And married with another.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I saw him on the wedding-day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For he was present in the church that day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In festive bravery deck'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          As one that came to grace the ceremony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I mark'd him when the ring was given,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          His countenance never changed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And when the priest pronounced the marriage blessing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          He put a silent prayer up for the bride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For so his moving lip interpreted.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          He came invited to the marriage feast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          With the bride's friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And was the merriest of them all that day:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But they, who knew him best, called it feign'd mirth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And others said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          He wore a smile like death upon his face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          His presence dash'd all the beholders' mirth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And he went away in tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          <emphasis>What followed then?</emphasis></p>
<p>          Oh! then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          He did not, as neglected suitors use,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Affect a life of solitude in shades,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But lived,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In free discourse and sweet society,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Among his friends who knew his gentle nature best.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Yet ever when he smiled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          There was a mystery legible in his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That whoso saw him said he was a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Not long for this world.——</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And true it was, for even then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The silent love was feeding at his heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Of which he died:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Nor ever spake word of reproach,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Only, he wish'd in death that his remains</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Might find a poor grave in some spot, not far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          From his mistress' family vault, "being the place</p>

          Was a dear friend and lover of the PIPE;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          He us'd to say, <emphasis>one pipe of Kirkman's best</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Gave life a <emphasis>zest</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          To him 'twas meat, and drink, and physic,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To see the friendly vapour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Curl round his midnight taper,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And the black fume</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Clothe all the room,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In clouds as dark as <emphasis>science metaphysic</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          So still he smok'd, and drank, and crack'd his joke;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And, had he <emphasis>single</emphasis> tarried</p>

          He might have smok'd, and still grown old in smoke:</p>

<p>

            But RICHARD <emphasis>married</emphasis>.</p>

            His wife was one, who carried</p>

          The house was scour'd from top to toe,</p>

<p>

          You dar'd not walk upright</p>

            Protested that the noisome vapour</p>

            Had spoilt the best chintz curtains and the paper</p>

<p><strong>                      THE APE</strong></p>
<p>                       (1806)</p>
<p>          An Ape is but a trivial beast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Men count it light and vain;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But I would let them have their thoughts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To have my Ape again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          To love a beast in any sort,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Is no great sign of grace;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But I have loved a flouting Ape's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            'Bove any lady's face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          I have known the power of two fair eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            In smile, or else in glance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And how (for I a lover was)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            They make the spirits dance;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          But I would give two hundred smiles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Of them that fairest be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          For one look of my staring Ape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            That used to stare on me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          This beast, this Ape, it had a face—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            If face it might be styl'd—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Sometimes it was a staring Ape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Sometimes a beauteous child—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          A Negro flat—a Pagod squat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Cast in a Chinese mold—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And then it was a Cherub's face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Made of the beaten gold!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          But TIME, that's meddling, meddling still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And always altering things—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And, what's already at the best,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To alteration brings—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          That turns the sweetest buds to flowers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And chops and changes toys—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That breaks up dreams, and parts old friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And still commutes our joys—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          Has changed away my Ape at last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And in its place convey'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Thinking therewith to cheat my sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            A fresh and blooming maid!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          And fair to sight is she—and still</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Each day doth sightlier grow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Upon the ruins of the Ape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            My ancient play-fellow!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          The tale of Sphinx, and Theban jests,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I true in me perceive;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I suffer riddles; death from dark</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Enigmas I receive:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          Whilst a hid being I pursue,</p>
<empty-line/>

            That lurks in a new shape,</p>

<p><strong>        ON SEEING MRS. K—— B——, AGED UPWARDS
             OF EIGHTY, NURSE AN INFANT</strong></p>
<p>        A sight like this might find apology</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In worlds unsway'd by our Chronology;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As Tully says, (the thought's in Plato)—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "To die is but to go to Cato."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of this world Time is of the essence,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A kind of universal presence;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And therefore poets should have made him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Not only old, as they've pourtray'd him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But young, mature, and old—all three</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In one—a sort of mystery—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        ('Tis hard to paint abstraction pure.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Here young—there old—and now mature—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Just as we see some old book-print,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Not to one scene its hero stint;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But, in the distance, take occasion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To draw him in some other station.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Here this prepost'rous union seems</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A kind of meeting of extremes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ye may not live together. Mean ye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To pass that gulf that lies between ye</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

        In turning o'er historic pages?</p>

        Thou dost not to this age belong:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thou art three generations wrong:</p>

<p>

        Old Time has miss'd thee: there he tarries!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Go on to thy contemporaries!</p>

<p>

        Give the child up. To see thee kiss him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Is a compleat anachronism.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Nay, keep him. It is good to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Race link'd to race, in him and thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The child repelleth not at all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Her touch as uncongenial,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But loves the old Nurse like another—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Its sister—or its natural mother;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And to the nurse a pride it gives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To think (though old) that still she lives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With one, who may not hope in vain</p>

            A pair of ragamuffin brothers</p>

            Who knew their craft, but not forbid it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And whatsoe'er they nymm'd, she hid it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Received them with delight and wonder,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            When they brought home some 'special plunder;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Call'd them her darlings, and her white boys,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Her ducks, her dildings—all was right boys—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            "Only," she said, "my lads, have care</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Ye fall not into BLACK BACK'S snare;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<p>

            Had grown by fortune-telling rich;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To spells and conjurings did tackle her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And read folks' dooms by light oracular;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            In which she saw, as clear as daylight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            What mischief on her bairns would a-light;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Therefore she had a special loathing</p>

<empty-line/>

            And sneer'd with modern infidelity</p>
<empty-line/>

            At the old gipsy's fond credulity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            It proved all true tho', as she'd mumbled—</p>

<p>

            Incontinently fell a pulling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            They found it heavy—no slight matter—</p>

            'Woke Hercules, who in a trice</p>

            Had served for giants many a score—</p>

            Went bare for the most part, to be cool,</p>

<p>

            And save the time of his Groom of the Stole;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Besides, the smoke he had been in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            In Stygian gulf, had dyed his skin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To a natural sable—a right hell-fit—</p>

            That seem'd to careless eyes black velvet.</p>

<p>

            With horror view the black costume,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And each persumes his hour is come!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Then softly to themselves 'gan mutter</p>

<p>

            Yet not so softly, but with ease</p>

            Were overheard by Hercules.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Quoth Cacus—"This is he she spoke of,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Which we so often made a joke of."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            "I see," said the other, "thank our sin for't,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            'Tis BLACK BACK sure enough—we're in for 't."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            His Godship who, for all his brag</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Of roughness, was at heart a wag,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            At his new name was tickled finely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And fell a laughing most divinely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Quoth he, "I'll tell this jest in heaven—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            The musty rogues shall be forgiven."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            So in a twinkling did uncase them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            On mother earth once more to place them—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            The varlets, glad to be unhamper'd,</p>

            Made each a leg—then fairly scamper'd.</p>

<p>

        Self-propt, self-balanced, and secure from fall</p>

<p>

        By her own weight: and how with liquid robe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Blue ocean girdles round her tiny globe,</p>

<p><strong>        EXISTENCE, CONSIDERED IN ITSELF, NO BLESSING</strong></p>
<p>            <emphasis>From the Latin of Palingenius</emphasis></p>
<p>                       (1832)</p>
<p>The Poet, after a seeming approval of suicide, from a consideration of
the cares and crimes of life, finally rejecting it, discusses the
negative importance of existence, contemplated in itself, without
reference to good or evil.</p>
<p>        Of these sad truths consideration had—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thou shalt not fear to quit this world so mad,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So wicked; but the tenet rather hold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of wise Calanus, and his followers old,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who with their own wills their own freedom wrought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And by self-slaughter their dismissal sought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From this dark den of crime—this horrid lair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of men, that savager than monsters are;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And scorning longer, in this tangled mesh</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of ills, to wait on perishable flesh,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Did with their desperate hands anticipate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The too, too slow relief of lingering fate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And if religion did not stay thine hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And God, and Plato's wise behests, withstand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I would in like case counsel thee to throw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        This senseless burden off, of cares below.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Not wine, <emphasis>as</emphasis> wine, men choose, but as it came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From such or such a vintage: 'tis the same</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With life, which simply must be understood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A black negation, if it be not good.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But if 'tis wretched all—as men decline</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And loath the sour lees of corrupted wine—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Tis so to be contemn'd. Merely TO BE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Is not a boon to seek, nor ill to flee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Seeing that every vilest little Thing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Has it in common, from a gnat's small wing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A creeping worm, down to the moveless stone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And crumbling bark from trees. Unless TO BE,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And TO BE BLEST, be one, I do not see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In bare existence, <emphasis>as</emphasis> existence, aught</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That's worthy to be loved, or to be sought.</p>

<p>          Like <emphasis>it</emphasis> you show a modest face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          An unpretending native grace;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            The tulip, and the pink,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The china and the damask rose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And every flaunting flower that blows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            In the comparing shrink.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>          Of lowly fields you think no scorn;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Yet gayest gardens would adorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And grace, wherever set.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Home-seated in your lonely bower,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Or wedded—a transplanted flower—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I bless you, Margaret!</p>

<p>            ADDITIONAL ALBUM VERSES AND ACROSTICS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                      WHAT IS AN ALBUM?</strong></p>
<p>        'Tis a Book kept by modern Young Ladies for show,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of which their plain grandmothers nothing did know.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        'Tis a medley of scraps, fine verse, and fine prose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And some things not very like either, God knows.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The soft First Effusions of Beaux and of Belles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of future LORD BYRONS, and sweet L.E.L.'s;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where wise folk and simple both equally shine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And you write your nonsense, that I may write mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Stick in a fine landscape, to make a display,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A flower-piece, a foreground, all tinted so gay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As NATURE herself (could she see them) would strike</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With envy, to think that she ne'er did the like:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And since some LAVATERS, with head-pieces comical,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Have pronounc'd people's hands to be physiognomical,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Be sure that you stuff it with AUTOGRAPHS plenty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All framed to a pattern, so stiff, and so dainty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They no more resemble folks' every-day writing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Than lines penn'd with pains do extemp'rel enditing;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or the natural countenance (pardon the stricture)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The faces we make when we sit for our picture.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Thus you have, dearest EMMA, an ALBUM complete—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which may <emphasis>you</emphasis> live to finish, and <emphasis>I</emphasis> live to see it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And since you began it for innocent ends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        May it swell, and grow bigger each day with new friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who shall set down kind names, as a token and test,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        As I my poor <emphasis>autograph</emphasis> sign with the rest.</p>

<p>        Thou fragile, filmy, gossamery thing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        First leaf of spring!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        At every lightest breath that quakest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And with a zephyr shakest;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Scarce stout enough to hold thy slender form together,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In calmest halcyon weather;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Next sister to the web that spiders weave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Poor flutterers to deceive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Into their treacherous silken bed:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O! how art thou sustained, how nourishèd!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All trivial as thou art,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Without dispute,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thou play'st a mighty part;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And art the herald to a throng</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Of buds, blooms, fruit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That shall thy cracking branches sway,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        While birds on every spray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Shall pay the copious fruitage with a sylvan song.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So 'tis with thee, whoe'er on thee shall look,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        First leaf of this beginning modest book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Slender thou art, God knowest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And little grace bestowest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But in thy train shall follow after,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Wit, wisdom, seriousness, in hand with laughter;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Provoking jests, restraining soberness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In their appropriate dress;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And I shall joy to be outdone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        By those who brighter trophies won;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Without a grief,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        That I thy slender promise have begun,</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>                         (1820)</p>
<p>        Close by the ever-burning brimstone beds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where Bedloe, Oates and Judas, hide their heads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I saw great Satan like a Sexton stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With his intolerable spade in hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Digging three graves. Of coffin shape they were,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For those who, coffinless, must enter there</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With unblest rites. The shrouds were of that cloth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which Clotho weaveth in her blackest wrath:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The dismal tinct oppress'd the eye, that dwelt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Upon it long, like darkness to be felt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The pillows to these baleful beds were toads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Large, living, livid, melancholy loads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Whose softness shock'd. Worms of all monstrous size</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Crawl'd round; and one, upcoil'd, which never dies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A doleful bell, inculcating despair,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Was always ringing in the heavy air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And all about the detestable pit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Strange headless ghosts, and quarter'd forms, did flit;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Rivers of blood, from living traitors spilt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        By treachery stung from poverty to guilt.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I ask'd the fiend, for whom these rites were meant?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        "These graves," quoth he, "when life's brief oil is spent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        When the dark night comes, and they're sinking bedwards,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        —I mean for Castles, Oliver, and Edwards."</p>

<p>        Much speech obscures the sense; the soul of wit</p>

        "One Dip was all his malady did need;</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

        "I'm to be dip—dip—dipt—." "We know it," they</p>
<empty-line/>

        Reply; expostulation seemed in vain,</p>
<empty-line/>

        And over ears they souse him in again,</p>

        Once more to rise; when, with a desperate lunge,</p>

        At length he bolts these words out, "Only once!"</p>

<p><strong>                    SATAN IN SEARCH OF A WIFE</strong></p>
<p>          _With the Whole Process of his Courtship
          and Marriage, and who Danced at the Wedding</p>
<p>                       By an Eye Witness_</p>
<p>                             (1831)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    DEDICATION</strong></p>
<p>    To delicate bosoms, that have sighed over the <emphasis>Loves of the Angels</emphasis>,
    this Poem is with tenderest regard consecrated. It can be no offence
    to you, dear Ladies, that the author has endeavoured to extend the
    dominion of your darling passion; to shew Love triumphant in places,
    to which his advent has been never yet suspected. If one Cecilia
    drew an Angel down, another may have leave to attract a Spirit
    upwards; which, I am sure, was the most desperate adventure of the
    two. Wonder not at the inferior condition of the agent; for, if King
    Cophetua wooed a Beggar Maid, a greater king need not scorn to
    confess the attractions of a fair Tailor's daughter. The more
    disproportionate the rank, the more signal is the glory of your sex.
    Like that of Hecate, a triple empire is now confessed your own. Nor
    Heaven, nor Earth, nor deepest tracts of Erebus, as Milton hath it,
    have power to resist your sway. I congratulate your last victory.
    You have fairly made an Honest Man of the Old One; and, if your
    conquest is late, the success must be salutary. The new Benedict has
    employment enough on his hands to desist from dabbling with the
    affairs of poor mortals; he may fairly leave human nature to
    herself; and we may sleep for one while at least secure from the
    attacks of this hitherto restless Old Bachelor. It remains to be
    seen, whether the world will be much benefited by the change in his
    condition.</p>

<p><strong>                       PART THE FIRST</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                             I</strong></p>
<p>        The Devil was sick and queasy of late,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And his sleep and his appetite fail'd him;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        His ears they hung down, and his tail it was clapp'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Between his poor hoofs, like a dog that's been rapp'd—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          None knew what the devil ail'd him.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>                            II</strong></p>
<p>        He tumbled and toss'd on his mattress o' nights,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          That was fit for a fiend's disportal;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For 'twas made of the finest of thistles and thorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Which Alecto herself had gather'd in scorn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Of the best down beds that are mortal.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>                           III</strong></p>
<p>        His giantly chest in earthquakes heaved,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          With groanings corresponding;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And mincing and few were the words he spoke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        While a sigh, like some delicate whirlwind, broke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          From a heart that seem'd desponding.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>                            IV</strong></p>
<p>        Now the Devil an Old Wife had for his Dam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I think none e'er was older:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Her years—old Parr's were nothing to them;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And a chicken to her was Methusalem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          You'd say, could you behold her.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>                             V</strong></p>
<p>        She remember'd Chaos a little child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Strumming upon hand organs;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        At the birth of Old Night a gossip she sat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The ancientest there, and was godmother at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          The christening of the Gorgons.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>                            VI</strong></p>
<p>        Her bones peep'd through a rhinoceros' skin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Like a mummy's through its cerement;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But she had a mother's heart, and guess'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        What pinch'd her son; whom she thus address'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          In terms that bespoke endearment.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>                           VII</strong></p>

<p><strong>                           XII</strong></p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

          "O mother, you have nick't it"—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And he turn'd his head aside with a blush—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Not red hot pokers, or crimson plush,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Could half so deep have prick'd it.</p>

<p><strong>                          XIII</strong></p>
<p>        "These twenty thousand good years or more,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          Quoth he, "on this burning shingle</p>

<p>

        I have led a lonesome Bachelor's life,</p>

          Or dressing, to make her charming;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        For the blood of the old prophetical race</p>

        Had heighten'd the natural flush of her face</p>

<p>

          Disapproves unequal matches.</p>
<empty-line/>

        "O Mother," he cried, "dispatch them hence!</p>

<p>                       (1800)</p>
<p>    Ladies, ye've seen how Guzman's consort died,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Poor victim of a Spaniard brother's pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When Spanish honour through the world was blown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Spanish beauty for the best was known[19].</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In that romantic, unenlighten'd time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A <emphasis>breach of promise</emphasis>[20] was a sort of crime—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which of you handsome English ladies here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But deem the penance bloody and severe?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A whimsical old Saragossa[21] fashion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That a dead father's dying inclination,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Should <emphasis>live</emphasis> to thwart a living daughter's passion[22],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Unjustly on the sex <emphasis>we</emphasis>[23] men exclaim,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Rail at <emphasis>your</emphasis>[24] vices,—and commit the same;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Man is a promise-breaker from the womb,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And goes a promise-breaker to the tomb—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What need we instance here the lover's vow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The sick man's purpose, or the great man's bow[25]?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The truth by few examples best is shown—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Instead of many which are better known,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Take poor Jack Incident, that's dead and gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Jack, of dramatic genius justly vain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Purchased a renter's share at Drury-lane;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A prudent man in every other matter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Known at his club-room for an honest hatter;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Humane and courteous, led a civil life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And has been seldom known to beat his wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But Jack is now grown quite another man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Frequents the green-room, knows the plot and plan</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of each new piece,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And has been seen to talk with Sheridan!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In at the play-house just at six he pops,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And never quits it till the curtain drops,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Is never absent on the <emphasis>author's night</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Knows actresses and actors too—by sight;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So humble, that with Suett he'll confer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or take a pipe with plain Jack Bannister;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nay, with an author has been known so free,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He once suggested a catastrophe—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In short, John dabbled till his head was turn'd:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His wife remonstrated, his neighbours mourn'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His customers were dropping off apace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Jack's affairs began to wear a piteous face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    One night his wife began a curtain lecture;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'My dearest Johnny, husband, spouse, protector,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

    Save us from ruin, you from bankruptcy—</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

    And try again your old industrious ways.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Jack, who was always scared at the Gazette,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And had some bits of scull uninjured yet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Promised amendment, vow'd his wife spake reason,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'He would not see another play that season—'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Three stubborn fortnights Jack his promise kept,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Was late and early in his shop, eat, slept,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And walk'd and talk'd, like ordinary men;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No <emphasis>wit</emphasis>, but John the hatter once again—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Visits his club: when lo! one <emphasis>fatal night</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His wife with horror view'd the well-known sight—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    John's <emphasis>hat, wig, snuff-box</emphasis>—well she knew his tricks—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Jack decamping at the hour of six.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Just at the counter's edge a playbill lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Announcing that 'Pizarro' was the play—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'O Johnny, Johnny, this is your old doing.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Quoth Jack, 'Why what the devil storm's a-brewing?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    About a harmless play why all this fright?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I'll go and see it, if it's but for spite—</p>

    Who, now grown old, that did not once admire</p>

    His goat, his parrot, his uncouth attire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The stick, due-notch'd, that told each tedious day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That in the lonely island wore away?</p>

      His was a various pen, that freely rov'd</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>    Bound for the port of matrimonial bliss,</p>

    Ere I hoist sail, I hold it not amiss,</p>

<p>

    (Since prosp'rous ends ask prudent introductions)</p>

<p><strong>      PROLOGUE TO COLERIDGE'S TRAGEDY OF "REMORSE"</strong></p>
<p>                        (1813)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    There are, I am told, who sharply criticise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our modern theatres' unwieldy size.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    We players shall scarce plead guilty to that charge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who think a house can never be too large:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Griev'd when a rant, that's worth a nation's ear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shakes some prescrib'd Lyceum's petty sphere;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And pleased to mark the grin from space to space</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Spread epidemic o'er a town's broad face.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O might old Betterton or Booth return</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To view our structures from their silent urn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Could Quin come stalking from Elysian glades,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or Garrick get a day-rule from the shades—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where now, perhaps, in mirth which Spirits approve,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He imitates the ways of men above,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And apes the actions of our upper coast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As in his days of flesh he play'd the ghost:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How might they bless our ampler scope to please,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And hate their own old shrunk up audiences.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Their houses yet were palaces to those,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which Ben and Fletcher for their triumphs chose.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like giant pent in disproportion'd cage,            }</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Mourn'd his contracted strengths and crippled rage. }</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He who could tame his vast ambition down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To please some scatter'd gleanings of a town,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And, if some hundred auditors supplied</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Their meagre meed of claps, was satisfied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How had he felt, when that dread curse of Lear's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Had burst tremendous on a thousand ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    While deep-struck wonder from applauding bands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Return'd the tribute of as many hands!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Rude were his guests; he never made his bow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To such an audience as salutes us now.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He lack'd the balm of labor, female praise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Few Ladies in his time frequented plays,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or came to see a youth with aukward art</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And shrill sharp pipe burlesque the woman's part.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The very use, since so essential grown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of painted scenes, was to his stage unknown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The air-blest castle, round whose wholesome crest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The martlet, guest of summer, chose her nest—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The forest walks of Arden's fair domain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where Jaques fed his solitary vein.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No pencil's aid as yet had dared supply,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Seen only by the intellectual eye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Those scenic helps, denied to Shakspeare's page,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our Author owes to a more liberal age.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nor pomp nor circumstance are wanting here;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Tis for himself alone that he must fear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yet shall remembrance cherish the just pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That (be the laurel granted or denied)</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>.                     O, no—that thought I banish.
    I woo—not wed; they never bring the Spanish.
    Their favours I pursue, and court the bays.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Sampson</emphasis>. Mayhap, you're one of them that write the plays?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>. Bumpkin!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Sampson</emphasis>.          I'm told the public's well-nigh crammed
    With such like stuff.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>.         The public may be damned.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Sampson</emphasis>. They ha'nt damned you? (<emphasis>inquisitively</emphasis>).</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>.           This fellow's wond'rous shrewd!
    I'd tell him if I thought he'd not be rude.
    Once in my greener years, I wrote a piece.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Sampson</emphasis>. Aye, so did I—at school like—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>.                                Booby, cease!

<p>    <emphasis>Sampson</emphasis>.         Well, and how—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>.                        It made a noise,
    A kind of mingled—(<emphasis>as if musing</emphasis>).</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Sampson</emphasis>.         Aye, describe it, try.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>. Like—Were you ever in the pillory?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Sampson</emphasis>. No, Sir, I thank ye, no such kind of game.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Gosling</emphasis>. Bate but the eggs, and it was much the same.
    Shouts, clamours, laughs, and a peculiar sound,
    'Like, like—</p>

      Plebeian Shakspeare must the words supply,—</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

      Scarce a Performer there below a Duke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He sate, and mused how in his Shakspeare's mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The idea of old Nobility enshrined</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Should thence a grace and a refinement have</p>
<empty-line/>

      So foul belied their great forefathers' fashion!</p>

      Their mind made up—no earthly pleading shook it,</p>

      In pure compassion 'till I undertook it.</p>

<p>               A Song by DANIEL</p>
<p>    <emphasis>"When the King enjoys his own again."</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A delicate song. Where did'st learn it, fellow?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL
Even there, where thou learnest thy oaths and thy politics—at our
master's table.—Where else should a serving-man pick up his poor
accomplishments?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN
Well spoken, Daniel. O rare Daniel!—his oaths and his politics!
excellent!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And where did'st pick up thy knavery, Daniel?</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That came to him by inheritance. His family have supplied the shire of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Devon, time out of mind, with good thieves and bad serving-men. All of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

his race have come into the world without their conscience.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good thieves, and bad serving-men! Better and better. I marvel what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Daniel hath got to say in reply.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL
I marvel more when thou wilt say any thing to the purpose, thou shallow
serving-man, whose swiftest conceit carries thee no higher than to
apprehend with difficulty the stale jests of us thy compeers. When was't
ever known to club thy own particular jest among us?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Most unkind Daniel, to speak such biting things of me!</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS
See—if he hath not brought tears into the poor fellow's eyes with the
saltness of his rebuke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL
No offence, brother Martin—I meant none. 'Tis true, Heaven gives gifts,
and with-holds them. It has been pleased to bestow upon me a nimble
invention to the manufacture of a jest; and upon thee, Martin, an
indifferent bad capacity to understand my meaning.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is that all? I am content. Here's my hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS
Well, I like a little innocent mirth myself, but never could endure
bawdry.</p>
<p>DANIEL
<emphasis>Quot homines tot sententiae.</emphasis></p>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And what is that?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis Greek, and argues difference of opinion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hope there is none between us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here's to thee, brother Martin. (<emphasis>Drinks.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to thee, Daniel. (<emphasis>Drinks.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to thee, Peter. (<emphasis>Drinks.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thank you, Francis. And here's to thee. (<emphasis>Drinks.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall be fuddled anon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And drunkenness I hold to be a very despicable vice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O! a shocking vice. (<emphasis>They drink round.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In as much as it taketh away the understanding.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And makes the eyes red.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And the tongue to stammer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And to blab out secrets.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>During this conversation they continue drinking.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some men do not know an enemy from a friend when they are drunk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Certainly sobriety is the health of the soul.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now I know I am going to be drunk.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How can'st tell, dry-bones?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because I begin to be melancholy. That's always a sign.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Take care of Martin, he'll topple off his seat else.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>Martin drops asleep.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>PETER
Times are greatly altered, since young master took upon himself the
government of this household.</p>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Greatly altered.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS
I think every thing be altered for the better since His Majesty's
blessed restoration.</p>
<p>PETER
In Sir Walter's days there was no encouragement given to good
house-keeping.</p>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

None.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>DANIEL</strong></p>
<p>For instance, no possibility of getting drunk before two in the
afternoon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>PETER</strong></p>
<p>Every man his allowance of ale at breakfast—his quart!</p>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A quart!! (<emphasis>in derision</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nothing left to our own sweet discretions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER
Whereby it may appear, we were treated more like beasts than what we
were—discreet and reasonable serving-men.</p>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like beasts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN
(<emphasis>Opening his eyes</emphasis>.) Like beasts.</p>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sleep, wag-tail!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS
I marvel all this while where the old gentleman has found means to
secrete himself. It seems no man has heard of him since the day of the
King's return. Can any tell why our young master, being favoured by the
court, should not have interest to procure his father's pardon?</p>
<p>DANIEL
Marry, I think 'tis the obstinacy of the old Knight, that will not be
beholden to the court for his safety.</p>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now that is wilful.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But can any tell me the place of his concealment?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That cannot I; but I have my conjectures.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two hundred pounds, as I hear, to the man that shall apprehend him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well, I have my suspicions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so have I.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I can keep a secret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS
(<emphasis>To Peter</emphasis>.) Warwickshire you mean. (<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nearer perhaps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I say nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hope there is none in this company would be mean enough to betray him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O Lord, surely not. (<emphasis>They drink to Sir Walter's safety</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FRANCIS
I have often wondered how our master came to be excepted by name in the
late Act of Oblivion.</p>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall I tell the reason?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Aye, do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DANIEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis thought he is no great friend to the present happy establishment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O! monstrous!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PETER
Fellow servants, a thought strikes me.—Do we, or do we not, come under
the penalties of the treason-act, by reason of our being privy to this
man's concealment.</p>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Truly a sad consideration.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>To them enters Sandford suddenly.</emphasis></p>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You well-fed and unprofitable grooms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Maintained for state, not use;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You lazy feasters at another's cost,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That eat like maggots into an estate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And do as little work,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Being indeed but foul excrescences,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And no just parts in a well-order'd family;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You base and rascal imitators,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who act up to the height your master's vices,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But cannot read his virtues in your bond:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which of you, as I enter'd, spake of betraying?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Was it you, or you, or, thin-face, was it you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARTIN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whom does he call thin-face?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No prating, loon, but tell me who he was,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That I may brain the villain with my staff,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That seeks Sir Walter's life?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You miserable men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With minds more slavish than your slave's estate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have you that noble bounty so forgot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which took you from the looms, and from the ploughs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which better had ye follow'd, fed ye, cloth'd ye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And entertain'd ye in a worthy service,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where your best wages was the world's repute,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That thus ye seek his life, by whom ye live?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have you forgot too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How often in old times</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Your drunken mirths have stunn'd day's sober ears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Carousing full cups to Sir Walter's health?—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whom now ye would betray, but that he lies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Out of the reach of your poor treacheries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This learn from me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our master's secret sleeps with trustier tongues,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Than will unlock themselves to carls like you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Go, get you gone, you knaves. Who stirs? this staff</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shall teach you better manners else.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Well, we are going.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And quickly too, ye had better, for I see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Young mistress Margaret coming this way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (<emphasis>Exeunt all but Sandford.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Margaret, as in a fright, pursued by a Gentleman,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

       who, seeing Sandford, retires muttering a curse.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

                  Sandford, Margaret.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Good-morrow to my fair mistress. 'Twas a chance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I saw you, lady, so intent was I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On chiding hence these graceless serving-men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who cannot break their fast at morning meals</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Without debauch and mis-timed riotings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This house hath been a scene of nothing else</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But atheist riot and profane excess,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Since my old master quitted all his rights here.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Each day I endure fresh insult from the scorn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of Woodvil's friends, the uncivil jests,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And free discourses, of the dissolute men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That haunt this mansion, making me their mirth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Does my young master know of these affronts?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I cannot tell. Perhaps he has not been told.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Perhaps he might have seen them if he would.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have known him more quick-sighted. Let that pass.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All things seem chang'd, I think. I had a friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (I can't but weep to think him alter'd too,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    These things are best forgotten; but I knew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A man, a young man, young, and full of honor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That would have pick'd a quarrel for a straw,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And fought it out to the extremity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    E'en with the dearest friend he had alive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On but a bare surmise, a possibility,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That Margaret had suffer'd an affront.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some are too tame, that were too splenetic once.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Twere best he should be <emphasis>told</emphasis> of these affronts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I am the daughter of his father's friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sir Walter's orphan-ward.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I am not his servant maid, that I should wait</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The opportunity of a gracious hearing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Enquire the times and seasons when to put</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My peevish prayer up at young Woodvil's feet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And sue to him for slow redress, who was</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Himself a suitor late to Margaret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I am somewhat proud: and Woodvil taught me pride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I was his favourite once, his playfellow in infancy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And joyful mistress of his youth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    None once so pleasant in his eyes as Margaret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His conscience, his religion, Margaret was,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His dear heart's confessor, a heart within that heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all dear things summ'd up in her alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As Margaret smil'd or frown'd John liv'd or died:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His dress, speech, gesture, studies, friendships, all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Being fashion'd to her liking.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His flatteries taught me first this self-esteem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His flatteries and caresses, while he loved.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The world esteem'd her happy, who had won</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His heart, who won all hearts;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And ladies envied me the love of Woodvil.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He doth affect the courtier's life too much,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whose art is to forget,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And that has wrought this seeming change in him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That was by nature noble.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Tis these court-plagues, that swarm about our house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have done the mischief, making his fancy giddy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With images of state, preferment, place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Tainting his generous spirits with ambition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I know not how it is;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A cold protector is John grown to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The mistress, and presumptive wife, of Woodvil</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Can never stoop so low to supplicate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A man, her equal, to redress those wrongs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which he was bound first to prevent;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But which his own neglects have sanction'd rather,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Both sanction'd and provok'd: a mark'd neglect,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And strangeness fast'ning bitter on his love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His love which long has been upon the wane.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For me, I am determined what to do:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To leave this house this night, and lukewarm John,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And trust for food to the earth and Providence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O lady, have a care</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of these indefinite and spleen-bred resolves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You know not half the dangers that attend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Upon a life of wand'ring, which your thoughts now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Feeling the swellings of a lofty anger,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To your abused fancy, as 'tis likely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Portray without its terrors, painting <emphasis>lies</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And representments of fallacious liberty—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You know not what it is to leave the roof that shelters you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have thought on every possible event,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The dangers and discouragements you speak of,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Even till my woman's heart hath ceas'd to fear them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And cowardice grows enamour'd of rare accidents.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nor am I so unfurnish'd, as you think,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of practicable schemes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now God forbid; think twice of this, dear lady.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I pray you spare me, Mr. Sandford,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And once for all believe, nothing can shake my purpose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But what course have you thought on?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To seek Sir Walter in the forest of Sherwood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have letters from young Simon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Acquainting me with all the circumstances</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of their concealment, place, and manner of life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And the merry hours they spend in the green haunts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of Sherwood, nigh which place they have ta'en a house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In the town of Nottingham, and pass for foreigners,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Wearing the dress of Frenchmen.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All which I have perus'd with so attent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And child-like longings, that to my doting ears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Two sounds now seem like one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    One meaning in two words, Sherwood and Liberty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And, gentle Mr. Sandford,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Tis you that must provide now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The means of my departure, which for safety</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Must be in boy's apparel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Since you will have it so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (My careful age trembles at all may happen)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I will engage to furnish you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have the keys of the wardrobe, and can fit you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With garments to your size.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I know a suit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of lively Lincoln Green, that shall much grace you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In the wear, being glossy fresh, and worn but seldom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Young Stephen Woodvil wore them, while he lived.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have the keys of all this house and passages,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And ere day-break will rise and let you forth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What things soe'er you have need of I can furnish you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And will provide a horse and trusty guide,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To bear you on your way to Nottingham.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That once this day and night were fairly past!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For then I'll bid this house and love farewell;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Farewell, sweet Devon; farewell, lukewarm John;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For with the morning's light will Margaret be gone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thanks, courteous Mr. Sandford.—</p>

<p><strong>ACT THE SECOND</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>An Apartment in Woodvil Hall.</emphasis></strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>John Woodvil—alone.</emphasis></p>
<p>(<emphasis>Reading Parts of a Letter.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>"When Love grows cold, and indifference has usurped upon old Esteem, it
is no marvel if the world begin to account <emphasis>that</emphasis> dependence, which
hitherto has been esteemed honorable shelter. The course I have taken
(in leaving this house, not easily wrought thereunto,) seemed to me best
for the once-for-all releasing of yourself (who in times past have
deserved well of me) from the now daily, and not-to-be-endured, tribute
of forced love, and ill-dissembled reluctance of affection.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                      "MARGARET."</strong></p>
<p>      Gone! gone! my girl? so hasty, Margaret!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And never a kiss at parting? shallow loves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And likings of a ten days' growth, use courtesies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And shew red eyes at parting. Who bids "farewell"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In the same tone he cries "God speed you, Sir?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or tells of joyful victories at sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where he hath ventures? does not rather muffle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      His organs to emit a leaden sound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To suit the melancholy dull "farewell,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which they in Heaven not use?—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      So peevish, Margaret?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But 'tis the common error of your sex,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When our idolatry slackens, or grows less,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (As who of woman born can keep his faculty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of Admiration, being a decaying faculty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For ever strain'd to the pitch? or can at pleasure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Make it renewable, as some appetites are,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As, namely, Hunger, Thirst?—) this being the case,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      They tax us with neglect, and love grown cold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Coin plainings of the perfidy of men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which into maxims pass, and apothegms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To be retailed in ballads.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          I know them all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      They are jealous, when our larger hearts receive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      More guests than one. (Love in a woman's heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Being all in one.) For me, I am sure I have room here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For more disturbers of my sleep than one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Love shall have part, but Love shall not have all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Ambition, Pleasure, Vanity, all by turns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Shall lie in my bed, and keep me fresh and waking;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Yet Love not be excluded.—Foolish wench,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I could have lov'd her twenty years to come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And still have kept my liking. But since 'tis so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Why, fare thee well, old play-fellow! I'll try</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To squeeze a tear for old acquaintance sake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I shall not grudge so much.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      <emphasis>To him enters Lovel</emphasis>.</p>
<p>LOVEL
Bless us, Woodvil! what is the matter? I protest, man, I thought you had
been weeping.</p>
<p>WOODVIL
Nothing is the matter, only the wench has forced some water into my
eyes, which will quickly disband.</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot conceive you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Margaret is flown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon what pretence?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL
Neglect on my part: which it seems she has had the wit to discover,
maugre all my pains to conceal it.</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then, you confess the charge?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL
To say the truth, my love for her has of late stopt short on this side
idolatry.</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As all good Christians' should, I think.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL
I am sure, I could have loved her still within the limits of warrantable
love.</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A kind of brotherly affection, I take it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We should have made excellent man and wife in time.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL
A good old couple, when the snows fell, to crowd about a sea-coal fire,
and talk over old matters.</p>
<p>WOODVIL
While each should feel, what neither cared to acknowledge, that stories
oft repeated may, at last, come to lose some of their grace by the
repetition.</p>
<p>LOVEL
Which both of you may yet live long enough to discover. For, take my
word for it, Margaret is a bird that will come back to you without a
lure.</p>
<p>WOODVIL
Never, never, Lovel. Spite of my levity, with tears I confess it, she
was a lady of most confirmed honour, of an unmatchable spirit, and
determinate in all virtuous resolutions; not hasty to anticipate an
affront, nor slow to feel, where just provocation was given.</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What made you neglect her, then?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL
Mere levity and youthfulness of blood, a malady incident to young men,
physicians call it caprice. Nothing else. He, that slighted her, knew
her value: and 'tis odds, but, for thy sake, Margaret, John will yet go
to his grave a bachelor. (<emphasis>A noise heard, as of one drunk and singing</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here comes one, that will quickly dissipate these humours.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>Enter one drunk</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>DRUNKEN MAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good-morrow to you, gentlemen. Mr. Lovel, I am your humble servant.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Honest Jack Woodvil, I will get drunk with you to-morrow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And why to-morrow, honest Mr. Freeman?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DRUNKEN MAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I scent a traitor in that question. A beastly question. Is it not his</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Majesty's birth-day? the day, of all days in the year, on which King</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Charles the second was graciously pleased to be born. (<emphasis>Sings</emphasis>) "Great</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

pity 'tis such days as those should come but once a year."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Drunk in a morning! foh! how he stinks!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DRUNKEN MAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And why not drunk in a morning? can'st tell, bully?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL
Because, being the sweet and tender infancy of the day, methinks, it
should ill endure such early blightings.</p>
<p>DRUNKEN MAN
I grant you, 'tis in some sort the youth and tender nonage of the day.
Youth is bashful, and I give it a cup to encourage it. (<emphasis>Sings</emphasis>) "Ale
that will make Grimalkin prate."—At noon I drink for thirst, at night
for fellowship, but, above all, I love to usher in the bashful morning
under the auspices of a freshening stoop of liquor. (<emphasis>Sings</emphasis>) "Ale in a
Saxon rumkin then makes valour burgeon in tall men."—But, I crave
pardon. I fear I keep that gentleman from serious thoughts. There be
those that wait for me in the cellar.</p>
<p>WOODVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who are they?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DRUNKEN MAN
Gentlemen, my good friends, Cleveland, Delaval, and Truby. I know by
this time they are all clamorous for me. (<emphasis>Exit, singing.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>WOODVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This keeping of open house acquaints a man with strange companions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(Enter, at another door, Three calling for Harry Freeman._)</p>
<p>     Harry Freeman, Harry Freeman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

     He is not here. Let us go look for him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

     Where is Freeman?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

     Where is Harry?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>Exeunt the Three, calling for Freeman.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>WOODVIL
Did you ever see such gentry? (<emphasis>laughing</emphasis>). These are they that fatten
on ale and tobacco in a morning, drink burnt brandy at noon to promote
digestion, and piously conclude with quart bumpers after supper, to
prove their loyalty.</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, shall we adjourn to the Tennis Court?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WOODVIL
No, you shall go with me into the gallery, where I will shew you the
<emphasis>Vandyke</emphasis> I have purchased. "The late King taking leave of his
children."</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will but adjust my dress, and attend you. (<emphasis>Exit Lovel.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN WOODVIL (<emphasis>alone</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now Universal England getteth drunk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For joy that Charles, her monarch, is restored:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And she, that sometime wore a saintly mask,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The stale-grown vizor from her face doth pluck,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And weareth now a suit of morris bells,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With which she jingling goes through all her towns and villages.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The baffled factions in their houses sculk:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The common-wealthsman, and state machinist,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The cropt fanatic, and fifth-monarchy-man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who heareth of these visionaries now?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    They and their dreams have ended. Fools do sing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where good men yield God thanks; but politic spirits,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who live by observation, note these changes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of the popular mind, and thereby serve their ends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then why not I? What's Charles to me, or Oliver,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But as my own advancement hangs on one of them?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I to myself am chief.—I know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some shallow mouths cry out, that I am smit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With the gauds and shew of state, the point of place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And trick of precedence, the ducks, and nods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which weak minds pay to rank. 'Tis not to sit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In place of worship at the royal masques,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Their pastimes, plays, and Whitehall banquetings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For none of these,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nor yet to be seen whispering with some great one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Do I affect the favours of the court.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I would be great, for greatness hath great <emphasis>power</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And that's the fruit I reach at.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Great spirits ask great play-room. Who could sit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With these prophetic swellings in my breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That prick and goad me on, and never cease,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To the fortunes something tells me I was born to?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who, with such monitors within to stir him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Would sit him down, with lazy arms across,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A unit, a thing without a name in the state,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A something to be govern'd, not to govern,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A fishing, hawking, hunting, country gentleman?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>Sherwood Forest</emphasis>.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIR WALTER WOODVIL. SIMON WOODVIL.
(<emphasis>Disguised as Frenchmen</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How fares my boy, Simon, my youngest born,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My hope, my pride, young Woodvil, speak to me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some grief untold weighs heavy at thy heart:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I know it by thy alter'd cheer of late.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thinkest, thy brother plays thy father false?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    It is a mad and thriftless prodigal,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Grown proud upon the favours of the court;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Court manners, and court fashions, he affects,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And in the heat and uncheck'd blood of youth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Harbours a company of riotous men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All hot, and young, court-seekers, like himself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Most skilful to devour a patrimony;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And these have eat into my old estates,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And these have drain'd thy father's cellars dry;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But these so common faults of youth not named,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Things which themselves outgrow, left to themselves,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I know no quality that stains his honor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My life upon his faith and noble mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Son John could never play thy father false.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I never thought but nobly of my brother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Touching his honor and fidelity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Still I could wish him charier of his person,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And of his time more frugal, than to spend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In riotous living, graceless society,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And mirth unpalatable, hours better employ'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (With those persuasive graces nature lent him)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In fervent pleadings for a father's life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I would not owe my life to a jealous court,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whose shallow policy I know it is,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On some reluctant acts of prudent mercy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Not voluntary, but extorted by the times,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In the first tremblings of new-fixed power,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And recollection smarting from old wounds,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On these to build a spurious popularity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Unknowing what free grace or mercy mean,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    They fear to punish, therefore do they pardon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For this cause have I oft forbid my son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By letters, overtures, open solicitings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or closet-tamperings, by gold or fee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To beg or bargain with the court for my life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And John has ta'en you, father, at your word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    True to the letter of his paternal charge.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Well, my good cause, and my good conscience, boy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shall be for sons to me, if John prove false.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Men die but once, and the opportunity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of a noble death is not an every-day fortune:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    It is a gift which noble spirits pray for.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I would not wrong my brother by surmise;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I know him generous, full of gentle qualities,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Incapable of base compliances,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No prodigal in his nature, but affecting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This shew of bravery for ambitious ends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He drinks, for 'tis the humour of the court,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And drink may one day wrest the secret from him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And pluck you from your hiding place in the sequel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fair death shall be my doom, and foul life his.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Till when, we'll live as free in this green forest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As yonder deer, who roam unfearing treason:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who seem the Aborigines of this place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or Sherwood theirs by tenure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Tis said, that Robert Earl of Huntingdon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Men call'd him Robin Hood, an outlaw bold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With a merry crew of hunters here did haunt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Not sparing the king's venison. May one believe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The antique tale?</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>    SIR WALTER</strong></p>
<p>    There is much likelihood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Such bandits did in England erst abound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When polity was young. I have read of the pranks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of that mad archer, and of the tax he levied</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On travellers, whatever their degree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Baron, or knight, whoever pass'd these woods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Layman, or priest, not sparing the bishop's mitre</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For spiritual regards; nay, once, 'tis said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He robb'd the king himself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A perilous man. (<emphasis>Smiling</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How quietly we live here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Unread in the world's business,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And take no note of all its slippery changes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Twere best we make a world among ourselves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A little world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Without the ills and falsehoods of the greater:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    We two being all the inhabitants of ours,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And kings and subjects both in one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Only the dangerous errors, fond conceits,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which make the business of that greater world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Must have no place in ours:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As, namely, riches, honors, birth, place, courtesy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Good fame and bad, rumours and popular noises,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Books, creeds, opinions, prejudices national,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Humours particular,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Soul-killing lies, and truths that work small good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Feuds, factions, enmities, relationships,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Loves, hatreds, sympathies, antipathies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all the intricate stuff quarrels are made of.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    (<emphasis>Margaret enters in boy's apparel</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What pretty boy have we here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>Bon jour, messieurs</emphasis>. Ye have handsome English faces,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I should have ta'en you else for other two,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I came to seek in the forest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who are they?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A gallant brace of Frenchmen, curled monsieurs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That, men say, haunt these woods, affecting privacy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    More than the manner of their countrymen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    We have here a wonder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The face is Margaret's face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The face is Margaret's, but the dress the same</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My Stephen sometimes wore.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    (<emphasis>To Margaret</emphasis>)</p>
<p>    Suppose us them; whom do men say we are?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or know you what you seek?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A worthy pair of exiles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Two whom the politics of state revenge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In final issue of long civil broils,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have houseless driven from your native France,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To wander idle in these English woods,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where now ye live; most part</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thinking on home, and all the joys of France,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where grows the purple vine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    These woods, young stranger,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And grassy pastures, which the slim deer loves,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Are they less beauteous than the land of France,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where grows the purple vine?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I cannot tell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To an indifferent eye both shew alike.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Tis not the scene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But all familiar objects in the scene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which now ye miss, that constitute a difference.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ye had a country, exiles, ye have none now;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Friends had ye, and much wealth, ye now have nothing;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our manners, laws, our customs, all are foreign to you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I know ye loathe them, cannot learn them readily;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And there is reason, exiles, ye should love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Our English earth less than your land of France,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where grows the purple vine; where all delights grow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Old custom has made pleasant.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You, that are read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So deeply in our story, what are you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A bare adventurer; in brief a woman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That put strange garments on, and came thus far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To seek an ancient friend:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And having spent her stock of idle words,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And feeling some tears coming,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hastes now to clasp Sir Walter Woodvil's knees,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And beg a boon for Margaret, his poor ward.  (<emphasis>Kneeling</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Not at my feet, Margaret, not at my feet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yes, till her suit is answer'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Name it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A little boon, and yet so great a grace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    She fears to ask it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some riddle, Margaret?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No riddle, but a plain request.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Name it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Free liberty of Sherwood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And leave to take her lot with you in the forest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A scant petition, Margaret, but take it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Seal'd with an old man's tears.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Rise, daughter of Sir Rowland.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    (<emphasis>Addresses them both.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>    O you most worthy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You constant followers of a man proscribed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Following poor misery in the throat of danger;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fast servitors to craz'd and penniless poverty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Serving poor poverty without hope of gain;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Kind children of a sire unfortunate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Green clinging tendrils round a trunk decay'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which needs must bring on you timeless decay;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fair living forms to a dead carcase join'd;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What shall I say?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Better the dead were gather'd to the dead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Than death and life in disproportion meet.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Go, seek your fortunes, children.—</p>

<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Why, whither should we go?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>You</emphasis> to the Court, where now your brother John</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Commits a rape on Fortune.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Luck to John!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A light-heel'd strumpet, when the sport is done.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>You</emphasis> to the sweet society of your equals,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where the world's fashion smiles on youth and beauty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where young men's flatteries cozen young maids' beauty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    There pride oft gets the vantage hand of duty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    There sweet humility withers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Mistress Margaret,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How fared my brother John, when you left Devon?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    John was well, Sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Tis now nine months almost,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Since I saw home. What new friends has John made?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or keeps he his first love?—I did suspect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some foul disloyalty. Now do I know,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    John has prov'd false to her, for Margaret weeps.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    It is a scurvy brother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fie upon it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All men are false, I think. The date of love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Is out, expired, its stories all grown stale,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O'erpast, forgotten, like an antique tale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of Hero and Leander.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>SIMON
I have known some men that are too general-contemplative for the narrow
passion. I am in some sort a <emphasis>general</emphasis> lover.</p>
<p>MARGARET
In the name of the boy God, who plays at hood-man-blind with the Muses,
and cares not whom he catches: what is it <emphasis>you</emphasis> love?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Simply, all things that live,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    From the crook'd worm to man's imperial form,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And God-resembling likeness. The poor fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That makes short holyday in the sun beam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And dies by some child's hand. The feeble bird</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With little wings, yet greatly venturous</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In the upper sky. The fish in th' other element,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That knows no touch of eloquence. What else?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yon tall and elegant stag,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who paints a dancing shadow of his horns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In the water, where he drinks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I myself love all these things, yet so as with a difference:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    for example, some animals better than others, some men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    rather than other men; the nightingale before the cuckoo, the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    swift and graceful palfrey before the slow and asinine mule.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Your humour goes to confound all qualities.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What sports do you use in the forest?—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Not many; some few, as thus:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To see the sun to bed, and to arise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like some hot amourist with glowing eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Bursting the lazy bands of sleep that bound him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With all his fires and travelling glories round him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sometimes the moon on soft night clouds to rest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like beauty nestling in a young man's breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all the winking stars, her handmaids, keep</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Admiring silence, while those lovers sleep.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sometimes outstretcht, in very idleness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nought doing, saying little, thinking less,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To view the leaves, thin dancers upon air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Go eddying round; and small birds, how they fare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When mother Autumn fills their beaks with corn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Filch'd from the careless Amalthea's horn;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And how the woods berries and worms provide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Without their pains, when earth has nought beside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To answer their small wants.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To view the graceful deer come tripping by,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then stop, and gaze, then turn, they know not why,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like bashful younkers in society.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To mark the structure of a plant or tree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all fair things of earth, how fair they be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET (<emphasis>smiling</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And, afterwards them paint in simile.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Mistress Margaret will have need of some refreshment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Please you, we have some poor viands within.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Indeed I stand in need of them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIR WALTER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Under the shade of a thick-spreading tree,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Upon the grass, no better carpeting,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    We'll eat our noon-tide meal; and, dinner done,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    One of us shall repair to Nottingham,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To seek some safe night-lodging in the town,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where you may sleep, while here with us you dwell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By day, in the forest, expecting better times,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And gentler habitations, noble Margaret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>Allons</emphasis>, young Frenchman—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>Allons</emphasis>, Sir Englishman. The time has been,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I've studied love-lays in the English tongue,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And been enamour'd of rare poesy:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which now I must unlearn. Henceforth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sweet mother-tongue, old English speech, adieu;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For Margaret has got new name and language new.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    (<emphasis>Exeunt.</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>ACT THE THIRD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>An Apartment of State in Woodvil Hall—Cavaliers drinking.</emphasis></strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN WOODVIL, LOVEL, GRAY, <emphasis>and four more.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More mirth, I beseech you, gentlemen—Mr. Gray, you are not merry.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRAY
More wine, say I, and mirth shall ensue in course. What! we have not yet
above three half-pints a man to answer for. Brevity is the soul of
drinking, as of wit. Despatch, I say. More wine. (<emphasis>Fills.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN
I entreat you, let there be some order, some method, in our drinkings. I
love to lose my reason with my eyes open, to commit the deed of
drunkenness with forethought and deliberation. I love to feel the fumes
of the liquor gathering here, like clouds.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN
And I am for plunging into madness at once. Damn order, and method, and
steps, and degrees, that he speaks of. Let confusion have her legitimate
work.</p>
<p>LOVEL
I marvel why the poets, who, of all men, methinks, should possess the
hottest livers, and most empyreal fancies, should affect to see such
virtues in cold water.</p>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Virtue in cold water! ha! ha! ha!—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN
Because your poet-born hath an internal wine, richer than lippara or
canaries, yet uncrushed from any grapes of earth, unpressed in mortal
wine-presses.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What may be the name of this wine?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN
It hath as many names as qualities. It is denominated indifferently,
wit, conceit, invention, inspiration, but its most royal and
comprehensive name is <emphasis>fancy</emphasis>.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And where keeps he this sovereign liquor?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN
Its cellars are in the brain, whence your true poet deriveth
intoxication at will; while his animal spirits, catching a pride from
the quality and neighbourhood of their noble relative, the brain, refuse
to be sustained by wines and fermentations of earth.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But is your poet-born alway tipsy with this liquor?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN
He hath his stoopings and reposes; but his proper element is the sky,
and in the suburbs of the empyrean.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN
Is your wine-intellectual so exquisite? henceforth, I, a man of plain
conceit, will, in all humility, content my mind with canaries.</p>
<p>FOURTH GENTLEMAN
I am for a song or a catch. When will the catches come on, the sweet
wicked catches?</p>
<p>JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They cannot be introduced with propriety before midnight. Every man must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

commit his twenty bumpers first. We are not yet well roused. Frank</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lovel, the glass stands with you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gentlemen, the Duke. (<emphasis>Fills</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Duke. (<emphasis>They drink</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can any tell, why his Grace, being a Papist—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN
Pshaw! we will have no questions of state now. Is not this his Majesty's
birth-day?</p>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What follows?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That every man should sing, and be joyful, and ask no questions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Damn politics, they spoil drinking.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For certain,'tis a blessed monarchy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN
The cursed fanatic days we have seen! The times have been when swearing
was out of fashion.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And drinking.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And wenching.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRAY
The cursed yeas and forsooths, which we have heard uttered, when a man
could not rap out an innocent oath, but strait the air was thought to be
infected.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL
'Twas a pleasant trick of the saint, which that trim puritan
<emphasis>Swear-not-at-all Smooth-speech</emphasis> used, when his spouse chid him with an
oath for committing with his servant-maid, to cause his house to be
fumigated with burnt brandy, and ends of scripture, to disperse the
devil's breath, as he termed it.</p>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRAY
But 'twas pleasanter, when the other saint <emphasis>Resist-the-devil-
and-he-will-flee-from-thee Pure-man</emphasis> was overtaken in the act, to plead
an illusio visûs, and maintain his sanctity upon a supposed power in the
adversary to counterfeit the shapes of things.</p>
<p>ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN
Another round, and then let every man devise what trick he can in his
fancy, for the better manifesting our loyalty this day.</p>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall we hang a puritan?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No, that has been done already in Coleman-Street.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or fire a conventicle?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That is stale too.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or burn the assembly's catechism?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FOURTH GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or drink the king's health, every man standing upon his head naked?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN (<emphasis>to Lovel</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have here some pleasant madness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN
Who shall pledge me in a pint bumper, while we drink to the king upon
our knees?</p>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why on our knees, Cavalier?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN (<emphasis>smiling</emphasis>)
For more devotion, to be sure. (<emphasis>To a servant</emphasis>.) Sirrah, fetch the gilt
goblets.</p>
<p>(<emphasis>The goblets are brought. They drink the king's health, kneeling. A
shout of general approbation following the first appearance of the
goblets</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>JOHN
We have here the unchecked virtues of the grape. How the vapours curl
upwards! It were a life of gods to dwell in such an element: to see,
and hear, and talk brave things. Now fie upon these casual potations.
That a man's most exalted reason should depend upon the ignoble
fermenting of a fruit, which sparrows pluck at as well as we!</p>
<p>GRAY (<emphasis>aside to Lovel</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Observe how he is ravished.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Vanity and gay thoughts of wine do meet in him and engender madness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>While the rest are engaged in a wild kind of talk, John advances to
the front of the stage and soliloquises</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My spirits turn to fire, they mount so fast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My joys are turbulent, my hopes shew like fruition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    These high and gusty relishes of life, sure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have no allayings of mortality in them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I am too hot now and o'ercapable,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For the tedious processes, and creeping wisdom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of human acts, and enterprizes of a man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I want some seasonings of adversity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some strokes of the old mortifier Calamity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To take these swellings down, divines call vanity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mr. Woodvil, Mr. Woodvil.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where is Woodvil?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRAY
Let him alone. I have seen him in these lunes before. His abstractions
must not taint the good mirth.</p>
<p>    JOHN (<emphasis>continuing to soliloquize</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O for some friend now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To conceal nothing from, to have no secrets.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How fine and noble a thing is confidence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How reasonable too, and almost godlike!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fast cement of fast friends, band of society,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Old natural go-between in the world's business,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where civil life and order, wanting this cement,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Would presently rush back</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Into the pristine state of singularity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And each man stand alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>A Servant enters.</emphasis>)
Gentlemen, the fire-works are ready.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What be they?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL
The work of London artists, which our host has provided in honour of
this day.</p>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Sdeath, who would part with his wine for a rocket?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL
Why truly, gentlemen, as our kind host has been at the pains to provide
this spectacle, we can do no less than be present at it. It will not
take up much time. Every man may return fresh and thirsting to his
liquor.</p>
<p>THIRD GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There is reason in what he says.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Charge on then, bottle in hand. There's husbandry in that.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>They go out, singing. Only Level remains, who observes Woodvil</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>    JOHN (<emphasis>still talking to himself</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This Lovel here's of a tough honesty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Would put the rack to the proof. He is not of that sort,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which haunt my house, snorting the liquors,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And when their wisdoms are afloat with wine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Spend vows as fast as vapours, which go off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Even with the fumes, their fathers. He is one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whose sober morning actions</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shame not his o'ernight's promises;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Talks little, flatters less, and makes no promises;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Why this is he, whom the dark-wisdom'd fate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Might trust her counsels of predestination with,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And the world be no loser.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Why should I fear this man?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         (<emphasis>Seeing Lovel</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where is the company gone?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL
To see the fire-works, where you will be expected to follow. But I
perceive you are better engaged.</p>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have been meditating this half-hour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On all the properties of a brave friendship,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The mysteries that are in it, the noble uses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Its limits withal, and its nice boundaries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>Exempli gratia</emphasis>, how far a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    May lawfully forswear himself for his friend;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What quantity of lies, some of them brave ones,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He may lawfully incur in a friend's behalf;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What oaths, blood-crimes, hereditary quarrels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Night brawls, fierce words, and duels in the morning,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He need not stick at, to maintain his friend's honor, or his cause.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I think many men would die for their friends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Death! why 'tis nothing. We go to it for sport,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To gain a name, or purse, or please a sullen humour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When one has worn his fortune's livery threadbare,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or his spleen'd mistress frowns. Husbands will venture on it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To cure the hot fits and cold shakings of jealousy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A friend, sir, must do more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Can he do more than die?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To serve a friend this he may do. Pray mark me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Having a law within (great spirits feel one)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He cannot, ought not to be bound by any</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Positive laws or ord'nances extern,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But may reject all these: by the law of friendship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He may do so much, be they, indifferently,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Penn'd statutes, or the land's unwritten usages,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As public fame, civil compliances,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Misnamed honor, trust in matter of secrets,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All vows and promises, the feeble mind's religion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Binding our morning knowledge to approve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What last night's ignorance spake);</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The ties of blood withal, and prejudice of kin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sir, these weak terrors</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Must never shake me. I know what belongs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To a worthy friendship. Come, you shall have my confidence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I hope you think me worthy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You will smile to hear now—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sir Walter never has been out of the island.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You amaze me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That same report of his escape to France</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Was a fine tale, forg'd by myself—Ha! ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I knew it would stagger him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Pray, give me leave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where has he dwelt, how liv'd, how lain conceal'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sure I may ask so much.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    From place to place, dwelling in no place long,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My brother Simon still hath borne him company,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    ('Tis a brave youth, I envy him all his virtues.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Disguis'd in foreign garb, they pass for Frenchmen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Two Protestant exiles from the Limosin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Newly arriv'd. Their dwelling's now at Nottingham,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where no soul knows them.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL
Can you assign any reason, why a gentleman of Sir Walter's known
prudence should expose his person so lightly?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I believe, a certain fondness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A child-like cleaving to the land that gave him birth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Chains him like fate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have known some exiles thus</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To linger out the term of the law's indulgence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To the hazard of being known.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You may suppose sometimes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    They use the neighb'ring Sherwood for their sport,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Their exercise and freer recreation.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I see you smile. Pray now, be careful.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I am no babbler, sir; you need not fear me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But some men have been known to talk in their sleep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And tell fine tales that way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have heard so much. But, to say truth, I mostly sleep alone.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or drink, sir? do you never drink too freely?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some men will drink, and tell you all their secrets.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Why do you question me, who know my habits?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I think you are no sot,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No tavern-troubler, worshipper of the grape;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But all men drink sometimes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And veriest saints at festivals relax,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The marriage of a friend, or a wife's birth-day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How much, sir, may a man with safety drink? (<emphasis>Smiling</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sir, three half pints a day is reasonable;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I care not if you never exceed that quantity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I shall observe it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On holidays two quarts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or stay; you keep no wench?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No painted mistress for your private hours?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You keep no whore, sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What does he mean?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who for a close embrace, a toy of sin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And amorous praising of your worship's breath,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In rosy junction of four melting lips,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Can kiss out secrets from you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How strange this passionate behaviour shews in you!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sure you think me some weak one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Pray pardon me some fears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You have now the pledge of a dear father's life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I am a son—would fain be thought a loving one;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You may allow me some fears: do not despise me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If, in a posture foreign to my spirit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And by our well-knit friendship I conjure you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Touch not Sir Walter's life. (<emphasis>Kneels</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You see these tears. My father's an old man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Pray let him live.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I must be bold to tell you, these new freedoms</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shew most unhandsome in you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN (<emphasis>rising</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ha! do you say so?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sure, you are not grown proud upon my secret!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ah! now I see it plain. He would be babbling.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No doubt a garrulous and hard-fac'd traitor—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But I'll not give you leave. (<emphasis>Draws</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What does this madman mean?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Come, sir; here is no subterfuge.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You must kill me, or I kill you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL (<emphasis>drawing</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then self-defence plead my excuse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have at you, sir. (<emphasis>They fight</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Stay, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I hope you have made your will.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If not, 'tis no great matter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A broken cavalier has seldom much</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He can bequeath: an old worn peruke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A snuff-box with a picture of Prince Rupert,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A rusty sword he'll swear was used at Naseby,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Though it ne'er came within ten miles of the place;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And, if he's very rich,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A cheap edition of the <emphasis>Icon Basilike</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Is mostly all the wealth he dies possest of.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You say few prayers, I fancy;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So to it again. (<emphasis>They fight again. Lovel is disarmed</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You had best now take my life. I guess you mean it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN (<emphasis>musing</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No:—Men will say I fear'd him, if I kill'd him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Live still, and be a traitor in thy wish,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But never act thy thought, being a coward.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That vengeance, which thy soul shall nightly thirst for,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And this disgrace I've done you cry aloud for,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Still have the will without the power to execute.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So now I leave you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Feeling a sweet security. No doubt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My secret shall remain a virgin for you!—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (<emphasis>Goes out, smiling in scorn</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    LOVEL (<emphasis>rising</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For once you are mistaken in your man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The deed you wot of shall forthwith be done.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A bird let loose, a secret out of hand,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Returns not back. Why, then 'tis baby policy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To menace him who hath it in his keeping.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I will go look for Gray;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then, northward ho! such tricks as we shall play</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have not been seen, I think, in merry Sherwood,</p>
<empty-line/>

    Since the days of Robin Hood, that archer good.</p>

<p>    JOHN WOODVIL (<emphasis>alone</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A weight of wine lies heavy on my head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The unconcocted follies of last night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now all those jovial fancies, and bright hopes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Children of wine, go off like dreams.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This sick vertigo here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Preacheth of temperance, no sermon better.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    These black thoughts, and dull melancholy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That stick like burrs to the brain, will they ne'er leave me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some men are full of choler, when they are drunk;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some brawl of matter foreign to themselves;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And some, the most resolved fools of all,</p>

<p><strong>SIR WALTER. SIMON. LOVEL. GRAY.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, we are sorry we cannot return your French salutation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor otherwise consider this garb you trust to than as a poor disguise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>

Nor use much ceremony with a traitor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>

Therefore, without much induction of superfluous words, I attach you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir Walter Woodvil, of High Treason, in the King's name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And of taking part in the great Rebellion against our late lawful</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sovereign, Charles the First.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIMON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

John has betrayed us, father.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LOVEL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Sir, you had best surrender fairly. We know you, Sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIMON
Hang ye, villains, ye are two better known than trusted. I have seen
those faces before. Are ye not two beggarly retainers,
trencher-parasites, to John? I think ye rank above his footmen. A sort
of bed and board worms—locusts that infest our house; a leprosy that
long has hung upon its walls and princely apartments, reaching to fill
all the corners of my brother's once noble heart.</p>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We are his friends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIMON
Fie, Sir, do not weep. How these rogues will triumph! Shall I whip off
their heads, father? (<emphasis>Draws</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>LOVEL
Come, Sir, though this shew handsome in you, being his son, yet the law
must have its course.</p>
<p>SIMON
And if I tell you the law shall not have its course, cannot ye be
content? Courage, father; shall such things as these apprehend a man?
Which of ye will venture upon me?—Will you, Mr. Constable self-elect?
or you, Sir, with a pimple on your nose, got at Oxford by hard drinking,
your only badge of loyalty?</p>
<p>GRAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis a brave youth—I cannot strike at him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SIMON
Father, why do you cover your face with your hands? Why do you fetch
your breath so hard? See, villains, his heart is burst! O villains, he
cannot speak. One of you run for some water: quickly, ye knaves; will ye
have your throats cut? (<emphasis>They both slink off</emphasis>.) How is it with you, Sir
Walter? Look up, Sir, the villains are gone. He hears me not, and this
deep disgrace of treachery in his son hath touched him even to the
death. O most distuned, and distempered world, where sons talk their
aged fathers into their graves! Garrulous and diseased world, and still
empty, rotten and hollow <emphasis>talking</emphasis> world, where good men decay, states
turn round in an endless mutability, and still for the worse, nothing is
at a stay, nothing abides but vanity, chaotic vanity.—Brother, adieu!</p>
<p>    There lies the parent stock which gave us life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which I will see consign'd with tears to earth.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>Another Part of the Forest</emphasis>.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET (<emphasis>alone</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    It was an error merely, and no crime,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    An unsuspecting openness in youth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That from his lips the fatal secret drew,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which should have slept like one of nature's mysteries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Unveil'd by any man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Well, he is dead!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And what should Margaret do in the forest?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O ill-starr'd John!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O Woodvil, man enfeoffed to despair!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Take thy farewell of peace.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O never look again to see good days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or close thy lids in comfortable nights,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or ever think a happy thought again,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If what I have heard be true.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Forsaken of the world must Woodvil live,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If he did tell these men.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No tongue must speak to him, no tongue of man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Salute him, when he wakes up in a morning;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or bid "good-night" to John. Who seeks to live</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In amity with thee, must for thy sake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Abide the world's reproach. What then?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shall Margaret join the clamours of the world</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Against her friend? O undiscerning world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That cannot from misfortune separate guilt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No, not in thought! O never, never, John.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Prepar'd to share the fortunes of her friend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>For better or for worse</emphasis> thy Margaret comes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To pour into thy wounds a healing love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And wake the memory of an ancient friendship.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And pardon me, thou spirit of Sir Walter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who, in compassion to the wretched living,</p>
<empty-line/>

<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>Woodvil Hall</emphasis>.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>SANDFORD. MARGARET.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>As from a Journey</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SANDFORD
The violence of the sudden mischance hath so wrought in him, who by
nature is allied to nothing less than a self-debasing humour of
dejection, that I have never seen any thing more changed and
spirit-broken. He hath, with a peremptory resolution, dismissed the
partners of his riots and late hours, denied his house and person to
their most earnest solicitings, and will be seen by none. He keeps ever
alone, and his grief (which is solitary) does not so much seem to
possess and govern in him, as it is by him, with a wilfulness of most
manifest affection, entertained and cherished.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How bears he up against the common rumour?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SANDFORD
With a strange indifference, which whosoever dives not into the niceness
of his sorrow might mistake for obdurate and insensate. Yet are the
wings of his pride for ever clipt; and yet a virtuous predominance of
filial grief is so ever uppermost, that you may discover his thoughts
less troubled with conjecturing what living opinions will say, and judge
of his deeds, than absorbed and buried with the dead, whom his
indiscretion made so.</p>
<p>MARGARET
I knew a greatness ever to be resident in him, to which the admiring
eyes of men should look up even in the declining and bankrupt state of
his pride. Fain would I see him, fain talk with him; but that a sense of
respect, which is violated, when without deliberation we press into the
society of the unhappy, checks and holds me back. How, think you, he
would bear my presence?</p>
<p>SANDFORD
As of an assured friend, whom in the forgetfulness of his fortunes he
past by. See him you must; but not to-night. The newness of the sight
shall move the bitterest compunction and the truest remorse; but
afterwards, trust me, dear lady, the happiest effects of a returning
peace, and a gracious comfort, to him, to you, and all of us.</p>
<p>MARGARET
I think he would not deny me. He hath ere this received farewell letters
from his brother, who hath taken a resolution to estrange himself, for a
time, from country, friends, and kindred, and to seek occupation for his
sad thoughts in travelling in foreign places, where sights remote and
extern to himself may draw from him kindly and not painful ruminations.</p>
<p>SANDFORD
I was present at the receipt of the letter. The contents seemed to
affect him, for a moment, with a more lively passion of grief than he
has at any time outwardly shewn. He wept with many tears (which I had
not before noted in him) and appeared to be touched with a sense as of
some unkindness; but the cause of their sad separation and divorce
quickly recurring, he presently returned to his former inwardness of
suffering.</p>
<p>MARGARET
The reproach of his brother's presence at this hour should have been a
weight more than could be sustained by his already oppressed and sinking
spirit.—Meditating upon these intricate and wide-spread sorrows, hath
brought a heaviness upon me, as of sleep. How goes the night?</p>
<p>SANDFORD
An hour past sun-set. You shall first refresh your limbs (tired with
travel) with meats and some cordial wine, and then betake your no less
wearied mind to repose.</p>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A good rest to us all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SANDFORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thanks, lady.</p>

<p><strong>ACT THE FIFTH</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN WOODVIL (<emphasis>dressing</emphasis>).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How beautiful, (<emphasis>handling his mourning</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And comely do these mourning garments shew!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sure Grief hath set his sacred impress here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To claim the world's respect! they note so feelingly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By outward types the serious man within.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Alas! what part or portion can I claim</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In all the decencies of virtuous sorrow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which other mourners use? as namely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This black attire, abstraction from society,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Good thoughts, and frequent sighs, and seldom smiles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A cleaving sadness native to the brow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All sweet condolements of like-grieved friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (That steal away the sense of loss almost)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Men's pity, and good offices</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which enemies themselves do for us then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Putting their hostile disposition off,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As we put off our high thoughts and proud looks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (<emphasis>Pauses, and observes the pictures</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    These pictures must be taken down:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The portraitures of our most antient family</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For nigh three hundred years! How have I listen'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To hear Sir Walter, with an old man's pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Holding me in his arms, a prating boy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And pointing to the pictures where they hung,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Repeat by course their worthy histories,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (As Hugh de Widville, Walter, first of the name,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Ann the handsome, Stephen, and famous John:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Telling me, I must be his famous John.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But that was in old times.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now, no more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Must I grow proud upon our house's pride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I rather, I, by most unheard of crimes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Have backward tainted all their noble blood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Rased out the memory of an ancient family,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And quite revers'd the honors of our house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Who now shall sit and tell us anecdotes?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The secret history of his own times,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And fashions of the world when he was young:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How England slept out three and twenty years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    While Carr and Villiers rul'd the baby king:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The costly fancies of the pedant's reign,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Balls, feastings, huntings, shows in allegory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And Beauties of the court of James the First.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Margaret enters.</emphasis></p>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Comes Margaret here to witness my disgrace?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O, lady, I have suffer'd loss,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And diminution of my honor's brightness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You bring some images of old times, Margaret,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That should be now forgotten.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Old times should never be forgotten, John.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I came to talk about them with my friend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I did refuse you, Margaret, in my pride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If John rejected Margaret in his pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (As who does not, being splenetic, refuse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sometimes old play-fellows,) the spleen being gone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The offence no longer lives.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O Woodvil, those were happy days,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When we two first began to love. When first,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Under pretence of visiting my father,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Being then a stripling nigh upon my age)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You came a wooing to his daughter, John.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Do you remember,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With what a coy reserve and seldom speech,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Young maidens must be chary of their speech,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I kept the honors of my maiden pride?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I was your favourite then.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O Margaret, Margaret!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    These your submissions to my low estate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And cleavings to the fates of sunken Woodvil,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Write bitter things 'gainst my unworthiness.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thou perfect pattern of thy slander'd sex,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whom miseries of mine could never alienate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nor change of fortune shake; whom injuries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And slights (the worst of injuries) which moved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy nature to return scorn with like scorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then when you left in virtuous pride this house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Could not so separate, but now in this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My day of shame, when all the world forsake me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You only visit me, love, and forgive me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Dost yet remember the green arbour, John,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In the south gardens of my father's house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where we have seen the summer sun go down,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Exchanging true love's vows without restraint?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And that old wood, you call'd your wilderness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And vow'd in sport to build a chapel in it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    There dwell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        "Like hermit poor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In pensive place obscure,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    And tell your Ave Maries by the curls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Dropping like golden beads) of Margaret's hair;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And make confession seven times a day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of every thought that stray'd from love and Margaret;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And I your saint the penance should appoint—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Believe me, sir, I will not now be laid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Aside, like an old fashion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O lady, poor and abject are my thoughts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My pride is cured, my hopes are under clouds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have no part in any good man's love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In all earth's pleasures portion have I none,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I fade and wither in my own esteem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This earth holds not alive so poor a thing as I am.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I was not always thus. (<emphasis>Weeps</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thou noble nature,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which lion-like didst awe the inferior creatures,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now trampled on by beasts of basest quality,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My dear heart's lord, life's pride, soul-honor'd John,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Upon her knees (regard her poor request)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Your favourite, once-beloved Margaret, kneels.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What would'st thou, lady, ever-honor'd Margaret?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That John would think more nobly of himself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    More worthily of high heaven;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And not for one misfortune, child of chance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No crime, but unforeseen, and sent to punish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The less offence with image of the greater,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thereby to work the soul's humility,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Which end hath happily not been frustrate quite,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O not for one offence mistrust heaven's mercy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nor quit thy hope of happy days to come—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    John yet has many happy days to live;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To live and make atonement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Excellent lady,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whose suit hath drawn this softness from my eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Not the world's scorn, nor falling off of friends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Could ever do. Will you go with me, Margaret?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET (<emphasis>rising</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Go whither, John?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Go in with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And pray for the peace of our unquiet minds?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That I will, John.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>An inner Apartment</emphasis>.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(<emphasis>John is discovered kneeling.—Margaret standing over him</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN (<emphasis>rises</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I cannot bear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To see you waste that youth and excellent beauty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    ('Tis now the golden time of the day with you,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In tending such a broken wretch as I am.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    John will break Margaret's heart, if he speak so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    O sir, sir, sir, you are too melancholy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And I must call it caprice. I am somewhat bold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Perhaps in this. But you are now my patient,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (You know you gave me leave to call you so,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And I must chide these pestilent humours from you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    They are gone.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Mark, love, how cheerfully I speak!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I can smile too, and I almost begin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To understand what kind of creature Hope is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now this is better, this mirth becomes you, John.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yet tell me, if I over-act my mirth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Being but a novice, I may fall into that error,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That were a sad indecency, you know.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nay, never fear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I will be mistress of your humours,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And you shall frown or smile by the book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And herein I shall be most peremptory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Cry, "this shews well, but that inclines to levity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This frown has too much of the Woodvil in it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But that fine sunshine has redeem'd it quite."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How sweetly Margaret robs me of myself!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To give you in your stead a better self!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Such as you were, when these eyes first beheld</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You mounted on your sprightly steed, White Margery,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sir Rowland my father's gift,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all my maidens gave my heart for lost.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I was a young thing then, being newly come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Home from my convent education, where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Seven years I had wasted in the bosom of France:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Returning home true protestant, you call'd me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Your little heretic nun. How timid-bashful</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Did John salute his love, being newly seen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sir Rowland term'd it a rare modesty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And prais'd it in a youth.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now Margaret weeps herself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (<emphasis>A noise of bells heard</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hark the bells, John.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Those are the church bells of St. Mary Ottery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I know it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Saint Mary Ottery, my native village</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In the sweet shire of Devon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Those are the bells.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wilt go to church, John?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have been there already.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARGARET
How canst say thou hast been there already? The bells are only now
ringing for morning service, and hast thou been at church already?</p>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I left my bed betimes, I could not sleep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And when I rose, I look'd (as my custom is)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    From my chamber window, where I can see the sun rise;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And the first object I discern'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Was the glistering spire of St. Mary Ottery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Well, John.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then I remember'd 'twas the sabbath-day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Immediately a wish arose in my mind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To go to church and pray with Christian people.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    And then I check'd myself, and said to myself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    "Thou hast been a heathen, John, these two years past,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Not having been at church in all that time,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And is it fit, that now for the first time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thou should'st offend the eyes of Christian people</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With a murderer's presence in the house of prayer?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thou would'st but discompose their pious thoughts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And do thyself no good: for how could'st thou pray,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With unwash'd hands, and lips unus'd to the offices?"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And then I at my own presumption smiled;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And then I wept that I should smile at all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Having such cause of grief! I wept outright;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Tears like a river flooded all my face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And I began to pray, and found I could pray;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And still I yearn'd to say my prayers in the church.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    "Doubtless (said I) one might find comfort in it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So stealing down the stairs, like one that fear'd detection,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or was about to act unlawful business</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    At that dead time of dawn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I flew to the church, and found the doors wide open,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Whether by negligence I knew not,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Or some peculiar grace to me vouchsaf'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For all things felt like mystery).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    MARGARET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    JOHN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So entering in, not without fear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I past into the family pew,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And covering up my eyes for shame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And deep perception of unworthiness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Upon the little hassock knelt me down,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where I so oft had kneel'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A docile infant by Sir Walter's side;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And, thinking so, I wept a second flood</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    More poignant than the first;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But afterwards was greatly comforted.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    It seem'd, the guilt of blood was passing from me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Even in the act and agony of tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all my sins forgiven.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>    SERVANT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    One summer night Sir Francis, as it chanced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Was pacing to and fro in the avenue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That westward fronts our house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Among those aged oaks, said to have been planted</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Three hundred years ago</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By a neighb'ring prior of the Fairford name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Being o'er-task'd in thought, he heeded not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The importunate suit of one who stood by the gate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And begged an alms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Some say he shoved her rudely from the gate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With angry chiding; but I can never think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Our master's nature hath a sweetness in it)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That he could use a woman, an old woman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With such discourtesy: but he refused her—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And better had he met a lion in his path</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Than that old woman that night;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For she was one who practised the black arts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And served the devil, being since burnt for witchcraft.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    She looked at him as one that meant to blast him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And with a frightful noise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    ('Twas partly like a woman's voice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And partly like the hissing of a snake,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    She nothing said but this:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Sir Francis told the words)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        <emphasis>A mischief, mischief, mischief,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

        And a nine-times-killing curse,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

      By day and by night, to the caitiff wight,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

      Who shakes the poor like snakes from his door,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

        And shuts up the womb of his purse</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    And still she cried</p>
<p>          <emphasis>A mischief,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

        And a nine-fold-withering curse:</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

      For that shall come to thee that will undo thee,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

        Both all that thou fearest and worse</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    So saying, she departed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Leaving Sir Francis like a man, beneath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whose feet a scaffolding was suddenly falling;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So he described it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    STRANGER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A terrible curse! What followed?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SERVANT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nothing immediate, but some two months after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Young Philip Fairford suddenly fell sick,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And none could tell what ailed him; for he lay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And pined, and pined, till all his hair fell off,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And he, that was full-fleshed, became as thin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As a two-months' babe that has been starved in the nursing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And sure I think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He bore his death-wound like a little child;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With such rare sweetness of dumb melancholy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    He strove to clothe his agony in smiles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which he would force up in his poor pale cheeks,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like ill-timed guests that had no proper dwelling there;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And, when they asked him his complaint, he laid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His hand upon his heart to shew the place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where Susan came to him a-nights, he said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And prick'd him with a pin.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And thereupon Sir Francis called to mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The beggar-witch that stood by the gateway</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And begged an alms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    STRANGER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But did the witch confess?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    SERVANT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All this and more at her death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    STRANGER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I do not love to credit tales of magic.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Heaven's music, which is Order, seems unstrung,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And this brave world</p>
<empty-line/>

    (The mystery of God) unbeautified,</p>

<p>    If we have sinn'd in paring down a name,</p>

    All civil well-bred authors do the same.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Survey the columns of our daily writers—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You'll find that some Initials are great fighters.</p>

<p>

    How fierce the shock, how fatal is the jar,</p>

    Nor with less lustre have Initials shone,</p>
<empty-line/>

    To grace the gentler annals of Crim. Con.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Where the dispensers of the public lash</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Soft penance give; a letter and a dash—</p>

    Where vice reduced in size shrinks to a failing,</p>

    Which such a pliant Vowel must not grant</p>

    To such a very pressing Consonant?</p>

    Or who poetic justice dares dispute,</p>

    When, mildly melting at a lover's suit,</p>

<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Landlord, has the man brought home my boots?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LANDLORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, Sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have paid him?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LANDLORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There is the receipt, Sir, only not quite filled up, no name, only</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

blank—"Blank, Dr. to Zekiel Spanish for one pair of best hessians."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, Sir, he wishes to know what name he shall put in, who he shall say</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Dr."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, Mr. H. to be sure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LANDLORD
So I told him, Sir; but Zekiel has some qualms about it. He says, he
thinks that Mr. H. only would not stand good in law.</p>
<p>MR. H.
Rot his impertinence, bid him put in Nebuchadnezzar, and not trouble me
with his scruples.</p>

<p>WAITER
Sir, Squire Level's man is below, with a hare and a brace of pheasants

master. Presents it seems will find me out, with any name, or no name.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, the man that makes up the Directory is at the door.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give him a shilling, that is what these fellows come for.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND WAITER
He has sent up to know by what name your Honour will please to be
inserted.</p>
<p>MR. H.
Zounds, fellow, I give him a shilling for leaving out my name, not for
putting it in. This is one of the plaguy comforts of going anonymous.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Exit Second Waiter</emphasis>.]</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Third Waiter</emphasis>.</p>
<p>THIRD WAITER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two letters for Mr. H. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
From ladies (<emphasis>opens them</emphasis>). This from Melesinda, to remind me of the
morning call I promised; the pretty creature positively languishes to be
made Mrs. H. I believe I must indulge her (<emphasis>affectedly</emphasis>). This from her
cousin, to bespeak me to some party, I suppose (<emphasis>opening it</emphasis>)—Oh, "this
evening"—"Tea and cards"—(<emphasis>surveying himself with complacency</emphasis>). Dear
H., thou art certainly a pretty fellow. I wonder what makes thee such a
favourite among the ladies: I wish it may not be owing to the
concealment of thy unfortunate—pshaw!</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Fourth Waiter</emphasis>.</p>
<p>FOURTH WAITER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, one Mr. Printagain is enquiring for you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Oh, I remember, the poet; he is publishing by subscription. Give him a
guinea, and tell him he may put me down.</p>
<p>FOURTH WAITER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What name shall I tell him, Sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Zounds, he is a poet; let him fancy a name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[<emphasis>Exit Fourth Waiter</emphasis>.]</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Fifth Waiter</emphasis>.</p>
<p>FIFTH WAITER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir, Bartlemy the lame beggar, that you sent a private donation to last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Monday, has by some accident discovered his benefactor, and is at the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

door waiting to return thanks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Oh, poor fellow, who could put it into his head? Now I shall be teazed
by all his tribe, when once this is known. Well, tell him I am glad I
could be of any service to him, and send him away.</p>
<p>FIFTH WAITER
I would have done so, Sir; but the object of his call now, he says, is
only to know who he is obliged to.</p>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FIFTH WAITER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, Sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Me, me, me, who else, to be sure?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FIFTH WAITER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, Sir; but he is anxious to know the name of his benefactor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Here is a pampered rogue of a beggar, that cannot be obliged to a
gentleman in the way of his profession, but he must know the name,
birth, parentage, and education of his benefactor. I warrant you, next
he will require a certificate of one's good behaviour, and a
magistrate's licence in one's pocket, lawfully empowering so and so
to—give an alms. Any thing more?  FIFTH WAITER</p>
<p>Yes, Sir: here has been Mr. Patriot, with the county petition to sign;
and Mr. Failtime, that owes so much money, has sent to remind you of
your promise to bail him.</p>
<p>MR. H.
Neither of which I can do, while I have no name. Here is more of the
plaguy comforts of going anonymous, that one can neither serve one's
friend nor one's country. Damn it, a man had better be without a nose,
than without a name. I will not live long in this mutilated, dismembered
state; I will to Melesinda this instant, and try to forget these
vexations. Melesinda! there is music in the name; but then, hang it,
there is none in mine to answer to it. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>(<emphasis>While Mr. H. has been speaking, two Gentlemen have been observing him
curiously.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who the devil is this extraordinary personage?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who? why 'tis Mr. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Has he no more name?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN
None that has yet transpired. No more! why that single letter has been
enough to inflame the imaginations of all the ladies in Bath. He has
been here but a fortnight, and is already received into all the first
families.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wonderful! yet nobody knows who he is, or where he comes from!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN
He is vastly rich, gives away money as if he had infinity; dresses well,
as you see; and for address, the mothers are all dying for fear the
daughters should get him; and for the daughters, he may command them as
absolutely as—. Melesinda, the rich heiress, 'tis thought, will carry
him.</p>
<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And is it possible that a mere anonymous—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND GENTLEMAN
Phoo! that is the charm, Who is he? and What is he? and What is his
name?—The man with the great nose on his face never excited more of the
gaping passion of wonderment in the dames of Strasburg, than this
new-comer with the single letter to his name, has lighted up among the
wives and maids of Bath; his simply having lodgings here, draws more
visitors to the house than an election. Come with me to the parade, and
I will shew you more of him. [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.]</p>

Not so. Oh, Belvil, you are blest with one which sighing virgins may
repeat without a blush, and for it change the paternal. But what virgin
of any delicacy (and I require some in a wife) would endure to be called
Mrs.——?</p>
<p>BELVIL
Ha! ha! ha! most absurd. Did not Clementina Falconbridge, the romantic
Clementina Falconbridge, fancy Tommy Potts? and Rosabella Sweetlips
sacrifice her mellifluous appellative to Jack Deady? Matilda her cousin
married a Gubbins, and her sister Amelia a Clutterbuck.</p>

Hush, Jack, don't betray yourself. But you are really ashamed of the
family name?</p>
<p>MR. H.
Aye, and of my father that begot me, and my father's father, and all
their forefathers that have borne it since the conquest.</p>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But how do you know the women are so squeamish?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
I have tried them. I tell you there is neither maiden of sixteen nor
widow of sixty but would turn up their noses at it. I have been refused
by nineteen virgins, twenty-nine relicts, and two old maids.</p>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That was hard indeed, Jack.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Parsons have stuck at publishing the banns, because they averred it was
a heathenish name; parents have lingered their consent, because they
suspected it was a fictitious name; and rivals have declined my
challenges, because they pretended it was an ungentlemanly name.</p>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ha, ha, ha, but what course do you mean to pursue?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
To engage the affections of some generous girl, who will be content to
take me as Mr. H.</p>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mr. H.?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Yes, that is the name I go by here; you know one likes to be as near the
truth as possible.</p>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Certainly. But what then? to get her to consent—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
To accompany me to the altar without a name—in short to suspend her
curiosity (that is all) till the moment the priest shall pronounce the
irrevocable charm, which makes two names one.</p>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that name—and then she must be pleased, ha, Jack?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Exactly such a girl it has been my fortune to meet with, heark'e
(<emphasis>whispers</emphasis>)—(<emphasis>musing</emphasis>) yet hang it, 'tis cruel to betray her
confidence.</p>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But the family name, Jack?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As you say, the family name must be perpetuated.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BELVIL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though it be but a homely one.</p>

melting fair.</p>

H.H.H. Sure it must be something precious by its being concealed. It
can't be Homer, that is a Heathen's name; nor Horatio, that is no
surname; what if it be Hamlet? the Lord Hamlet—pretty, and I his poor
distracted Ophelia! No, 'tis none of these; 'tis Harcourt or Hargrave,
or some such sounding name, or Howard, high born Howard, that would do;
may be it is Harley, methinks my H. resembles Harley, the feeling

My dear H. that is all you give me power to swear allegiance to,—to be
enamoured of inarticulate sounds, and call with sighs upon an empty
letter. But I will know.</p>
<p>MR. H.
My dear Melesinda, press me no more for the disclosure of that, which in
the face of day so soon must be revealed. Call it whim, humour, caprice,
in me. Suppose I have sworn an oath, never, till the ceremony of our
marriage is over, to disclose my true name.</p>
<p>MELESINDA
Oh! H.H.H. I cherish here a fire of restless curiosity which consumes
me. 'Tis appetite, passion, call it whim, caprice, in me. Suppose I have
sworn I must and will know it this very night.</p>
<p>MR. H.
Ungenerous Melesinda! I implore you to give me this one proof of your
confidence. The holy vow once past, your H. shall not have a secret to
withhold.</p>

My H. has overcome: his Melesinda shall pine away and die, before she
dare express a saucy inclination; but what shall I call you till we are

<p>SUSAN
Haven't you heard? it's all come out; Mrs. Guesswell, the parson's

Mrs. Setter and Mrs. Pointer, and she says, they were holding a sort of
<emphasis>cummitty</emphasis> about it.</p>
<p>BOTH</p>

What? What?</p>

<p>SUSAN
There can't be a doubt of it, she says, what from hisfigger and the

<p><emphasis>Enter Landlord</emphasis>.</p>
<p>LANDLORD
Here, Susan, James, Philip, where are you all? The London coach is come
in, and there is Mr. Fillaside, the fat passenger, has been bawling for
somebody to help him off with his boots. (<emphasis>The Chambermaid and Waiters
slip out</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>(<emphasis>Solus</emphasis>.) The house is turned upside down since the strange
gentleman came into it. Nothing but guessing and speculating, and
speculating and guessing; waiters and chambermaids getting into corners
and speculating, ostlers and stable-boys speculating in the yard, I
believe the very horses in the stable are speculating too, for there
they stand in a musing posture, nothing for them to eat, and not
seeming to care whether thay have any thing or no; and after all what
does it signify? I hate such curious—odso, I must take this box up into
his bed-room—he charged me to see to it myself—I hate such
inquisitive—I wonder what is in it, it feels heavy (<emphasis>Reads</emphasis>) "Leases,
title deeds, wills." Here now a man might satisfy his curiosity at once.
Deeds must have names to them, so must leases and wills. But I
wouldn't—no I wouldn't—it is a pretty box too—prettily dovetailed—I
admire the fashion of it much. But I'd cut my fingers off, before I'd do
such a dirty—what have I to do—curse the keys, how they rattle—rattle
in one's pockets—the keys and the halfpence (<emphasis>takes out a bunch and
plays with them</emphasis>). I wounder if any of these would fit; one might just
try them, but I wouldn't lift up the lid if they did. Oh no, what should
I be the richer for knowing? (<emphasis>All this time he tries the keys one by
one</emphasis>.) What's his name to me? a thousand names begin with an H. I hate
people that are always prying, poking and prying into things,—thrusting
their finger into one place—a mighty little hole this—and their keys
into another. Oh Lord! little rusty fits it! but what is that to me? I
wouldn't go to—no no—but it is odd little rusty should just happen.
(<emphasis>While he is turning up the lid of the box</emphasis>, MR. H. <emphasis>enters behing him

<p>LANDLORD
Oh Lord, Sir! pardon; no thief as I hope to be saved. Little Pry was
always honest.</p>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What else could move you to open that box!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LANDLORD
Sir, don't kill me, and I will confess the whole truth. This box
happened to be lying—that is, I happened to be carrying this box, and I
happened to have my keys out, and so—little rusty happened to fit—</p>
<p>MR. H.
So little rusty happened to fit!—and would not a rope fit that rogue's
neck? I see the papers have not been moved: all is safe, but it was as
well to frighten him a little (<emphasis>aside</emphasis>).</p>
<p>Come, Landlord, as I think you
honest, and suspect you only intended to gratify a little foolish
curiosity—</p>
<p>LANDLORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That was all, Sir, upon my veracity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this time I will pass it over. Your name is Pry, I think.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LANDLORD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, Sir, Jeremiah Pry, at your service.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
An apt name, you have a prying temper. I mean, some little curiosity, a
sort of inquisitiveness about you.</p>
<p>LANDLORD
A natural thirst after knowledge you may call it, Sir. When a boy I was
never easy, but when I was thrusting up the lids of some of my
school-fellows' boxes,—not to steal any thing, upon my honour,
Sir,—only to see what was in them; have had pens stuck in my eyes for
peeping through key-holes after knowledge; could never see a cold pie
with the legs dangling out at top, but my fingers were for lifting up
the crust,—just to try if it were pigeon or partridge,—for no other
reason in the world. Surely I think my passion for nuts was owing to the
pleasure of cracking the shell to get at something concealed, more than
to any delight I took in eating the kernel. In short, Sir, this appetite
has grown with my growth.</p>
<p>MR. H.
You will certainly be hanged some day for peeping into some bureau or
other, just to see what is in it.</p>
<p>LANDLORD
That is my fear, Sir. The thumps and kicks I have had for peering into
parcels, and turning of letters inside out,—just for curiosity. The
blankets I have been made to dance in for searching parish-registers for
old ladies' ages,—just for curiosity! Once I was dragged through a
horse-pond, only for peeping into a closet that had glass doors to it,
while my Lady Bluegarters was undressing,—just for curiosity!</p>
<p>MR. H.
A very harmless piece of curiosity, truly; and now, Mr. Pry, first have
the goodness to leave that box with me, and then do me the favour to
carry your curiosity so far, as to enquire if my servants are within.</p>
<p>LANDLORD
I shall, Sir. Here, David, Jonathan,—I think I hear them coming,—shall
make bold to leave you, Sir.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

You promised to begin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
They have something to say to me. The rascals want their wages raised, I
suppose; there is always a favour to be asked when they come smiling.
Well, poor rogues, service is but a hard bargain at the best. I think I
must not be close with them. Well, David—well, Jonathan.</p>
<p>FIRST FOOTMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have served your honour faithfully——</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND FOOTMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Only be pleased to——</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.</p>
<empty-line/>

Be quick with what you have to say, for I am in haste.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FIRST FOOTMAN</p>

<p>SECOND FOOTMAN</p>

Who it is we have the honour to serve.</p>

<p>

Why me, me, me; you serve me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND FOOTMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, Sir; but we do not know who you are.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Childish curiosity! do not you serve a rich master, a gay master, an
indulgent master?</p>
<p>FIRST FOOTMAN
Ah, Sir! the figure you make is to us, your poor servants, the principal
mortification.</p>
<p>SECOND FOOTMAN
When we get over a pot at the public-house, or in a gentleman's kitchen,
or elsewhere, as poor servants must have their pleasures—when the
question goes round, who is your master? and who do you serve? and one
says, I serve Lord So-and-so, and another, I am Squire Such-a-one's
footman——</p>
<p>FIRST FOOTMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have nothing to say for it, but that we serve Mr. H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SECOND FOOTMAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or Squire H.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
Really you are a couple of pretty modest, reasonable personages; but I
hope you will take it as no offence, gentlemen, if, upon a dispassionate
review of all that you have said, I think fit not to tell you any more
of my name, than I have chosen for especial purposes to communicate to
the rest of the world.</p>
<p>FIRST FOOTMAN</p>
<empty-line/>

Why then, Sir, you may suit yourself.</p>

Go, for a couple of ungrateful, inquisitive, senseless rascals! Go hang,
starve, or drown!—Rogues, to speak thus irreverently of the alphabet—I

<p>FIRST LADY
No, Madam, I would scorn any such little mean ways of conning at a
secret. For my part, I don't think any secret of that consequence.</p>
<p>SECOND LADY
That's just like me; I make a rule of troubling my head with nobody's
business but my own.</p>
<p>MELESINDA

justify herself that way——(<emphasis>aside</emphasis>).</p>

great ugly thing is that, that dangles at your bosom?</p>

This? it is a cross: how do you like it?</p>

<p>FIRST GENTLEMAN</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>MR. H.
Who spoke of absence of mind, did you, Madam? How do you do, Lady
Wearwell—how do? I did not see your ladyship before—what was I about
to say—O—absence of mind. I am the most unhappy dog in that way,
sometimes spurt out the strangest things—the most mal-a-propos—without
meaning to give the least offence, upon my honour—sheer absence of
mind—things I would have given the world not to have said.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
But you shall hear. I was to dine the other day at a great nabob's, that
must be nameless, who, between ourselves, is strongly suspected
of—being very rich, that's all. John, my valet, who knows my foible,
cautioned me, while he was dressing me, as he usually does where he
thinks there's a danger of my committing a <emphasis>lapsus</emphasis>, to take care in my
conversation how I made any allusion direct or indirect to presents
—you understand me? I set out double charged with my fellow's
consideration and my own, and, to do myself justice, behaved with
tolerable circumspection for the first half hour or so—till at last a
gentleman in company, who was indulging a free vein of raillery at the
expense of the ladies, stumbled upon that expression of the poet, which
calls them "fair defects."</p>
<p>FIRST LADY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is Pope, I believe, who says it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MR. H.
No, Madam; Milton. Where was I? O, "fair defects." This gave occasion to
a critic in company, to deliver his opinion on the phrase—that led to
an enumeration of all the various words which might have been used
instead of "defect," as want, absence, poverty, deficiency, lack. This
moment I, who had not been attending to the progress of the argument
(as the denouement will shew) starting suddenly up out of one of my
reveries, by some unfortunate connexion of ideas, which the last fatal
word had excited, the devil put it into my head to turn round to the
Nabob, who was sitting next me, and in a very marked manner (as it
seemed to the company) to put the question to him, Pray, Sir, what may
be the exact value of a lack of rupees? You may guess the confusion
which followed.</p>

A Baronet at the table, seeing my dilemma, jogged my elbow; and a

<empty-line/>
<p>BELVIL
Poor Jack, I am really sorry for him. The account which you give me of
his mortifying change of reception at the assembly, would be highly
diverting, if it gave me less pain to hear it. With all his amusing
absurdities, and amongst them not the least, a predominant desire to be
thought well of by the fair sex, he has an abundant share of good
nature, and is a man of honour. Notwithstanding all that has happened,
Melesinda may do worse than take him yet. But did the women resent it so
deeply as you say?</p>
<p>GENTLEMAN
O intolerably—they fled him as fearfully when 'twas once blown, as a
man would be avoided, who was suddenly discovered to have marks of the
plague, and as fast; when before they had been ready to devour the
foolishest thing he could say.</p>
<p>BELVIL
Ha! ha! so frail is the tenure by which these women's favourites
commonly hold their envied pre-eminence. Well, I must go find him out
and comfort him. I suppose, I shall find him at the inn.</p>

Was ever any thing so mortifying? to be refused by old Mother
Damnable!—with such parts and address,—and the little squeamish
devils, to dislike me for a name, a sound.—O my cursed name! that it
was something I could be revenged on! if it were alive, that I might
tread upon it, or crush it, or pummel it, or kick it, or spit it
out—for it sticks in my throat and will choak me.</p>
<p>My plaguy ancestors! if they had left me but a Van or a Mac, or an Irish
O', it had been something to qualify it.—Mynheer Van Hogsflesh—or
Sawney Mac Hogsflesh,—or Sir Phelim O'Hogsflesh,—but downright
blunt———. If it had been any other name in the world, I could have
borne it. If it had been the name of a beast, as Bull, Fox, Kid, Lamb,
Wolf, Lion; or of a bird, as Sparrow, Hawk, Buzzard, Daw, Finch,
Nightingale; or of a fish, as Sprat, Herring, Salmon; or the name of a
thing, as Ginger, Hay, Wood; or of a colour, as Black, Grey, White,
Green; or of a sound, as Bray; or the name of a month, as March, May; or
of a place, as Barnet, Baldock, Hitchin; or the name of a coin, as
Farthing, Penny, Twopenny; or of a profession, as Butcher, Baker,
Carpenter, Piper, Fisher, Fletcher, Fowler, Glover; or a Jew's name, as
Solomons, Isaacs, Jacobs; or a personal name, as Foot, Leg, Crookshanks,
Heaviside, Sidebottom, Longbottom, Ramsbottom, Winterbottom; or a long
name, as Blanchenhagen, or Blanchenhausen; or a short name, as Crib,
Crisp, Crips, Tag, Trot, Tub, Phips, Padge, Papps, or Prig, or Wig, or
Pip, or Trip; Trip had been something, but Ho———.</p>

<p>Farewell the most distant thoughts of marriage; the finger-circling
ring, the purity-figuring glove, the envy-pining bride-maids, the

blush-raising joke, the titter-provoking pun, the morning-stirring
drum.—No son of mine shall exist, to bear my ill-fated name. No nurse
come chuckling, to tell me it is a boy. No midwife, leering at me from
under the lids of professional gravity. I dreamed of caudle. <emphasis>(Sings in

Lord, Madam! before I'd take on as you do about a foolish—what
signifies a name? Hogs—Hogs—what is it—is just as good as any other
for what I see.</p>
<p>MELESINDA
Ignorant creature! yet she is perhaps blest in the absence of those
ideas, which, while they add a zest to the few pleasures which fall to
the lot of superior natures to enjoy, doubly edge the—</p>
<p>MAID
Superior natures! a fig! If he's hog by name, he's not hog by nature,
that don't follow—his name don't make him any thing, does it? He don't
grunt the more for it, nor squeak, that ever I hear; he likes his
victuals out of a plate, as other Christians do, you never see him go to
the trough—</p>
<p>MELESINDA</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unfeeling wretch! yet possibly her intentions—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MAID
For instance, Madam, my name is Finch—Betty Finch. I don't whistle the
more for that, nor long after canary-seed while I can get good wholesome
mutton—no, nor you can't catch me by throwing salt on my tail. If you
come to that, hadn't I a young man used to come after me, they said
courted me—his name was Lion—Francis Lion, a tailor; but though he was
fond enough of me, for all that, he never offered to eat me.</p>
<p>MELESINDA
How fortunate that the discovery has been made before it was too late.
Had I listened to his deceits, and, as the perfidious man had almost
persuaded me, precipitated myself into an inextricable engagement,
before—</p>
<p>MAID
No great harm, if you had. You'd only have bought a pig in a poke—and
what then? Oh, here he comes creeping—</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter</emphasis> MR. H. <emphasis>abject</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Go to her, Mr. Hogs—Hogs—Hogsbristles—what's your name? Don't be
afraid, man—don't give it up—she's not crying—only <emphasis>summat</emphasis> has made
her eyes red—she has got a sty in her eye, I believe—(<emphasis>going</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>MELESINDA</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are not going, Betty?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MAID
O, Madam, never mind me—I shall be back in the twinkling of a pig's
whisker, as they say. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>MR. H.
Melesinda, you behold before you a wretch who would have betrayed your
confidence, but it was love that prompted him; who would have tricked
you by an unworthy concealment into a participation of that disgrace
which a superficial world has agreed to attach to a name—but with it
you would have shared a fortune not contemptible, and a heart—but 'tis
over now. That name he is content to bear alone—to go where the
persecuted syllables shall be no more heard, or excite no meaning
—some spot where his native tongue has never penetrated, nor any of his
countrymen have landed, to plant their unfeeling satire, their brutal
wit, and national ill manners—where no Englishman—(<emphasis>Here Melesinda,
who has been pouting during this speech, fetches a deep sigh</emphasis>.) Some yet
undiscovered Otaheite, where witless, unapprehensive savages shall
innocently pronounce the ill-fated sounds, and think them not
inharmonious.</p>

Heyday, Jack! what means this mortified face? nothing has happened, I

arbitrator—strange—hark'e, Jack, nothing has come out, has there? you

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>SCENE I.—<emphasis>An Apartment at Flint's house.</emphasis></strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>FLINT. WILLIAM.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
Carry those umbrellas, cottons, and wearing-apparel, up stairs. You may
send that chest of tools to Robins's.</p>
<p>WILLIAM
That which you lent six pounds upon to the journeyman carpenter that had
the sick wife?</p>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The same.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILLIAM</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The man says, if you can give him till Thursday—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
Not a minute longer. His time was out yesterday. These improvident
fools!</p>
<p>WILLIAM
The finical gentleman has been here about the seal that was his
grandfather's.</p>
<p>FLINT
He cannot have it. Truly, our trade would be brought to a fine pass, if
we were bound to humour the fancies of our customers. This man would be
taking a liking to a snuff-box that he had inherited; and that
gentlewoman might conceit a favourite chemise that had descended to her.</p>
<p>WILLIAM
The lady in the carriage has been here crying about those jewels. She
says, if you cannot let her have them at the advance she offers, her
husband will come to know that she has pledged them.</p>
<p>FLINT
I have uses for those jewels. Send Marian to me. (<emphasis>Exit William</emphasis>.) I
know no other trade that is expected to depart from its fair advantages
but ours. I do not see the baker, the butcher, the shoemaker, or, to go
higher, the lawyer, the physician, the divine, give up any of their
legitimate gains, even when the pretences of their art had failed; yet
<emphasis>we</emphasis> are to be branded with an odious name, stigmatized, discountenanced
even by the administrators of those laws which acknowledge us; scowled
at by the lower sort of people, whose needs we serve!</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Marian</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Come hither, Marian. Come, kiss your father. The report runs that he is
full of spotted crime. What is your belief, child?</p>
<p>MARIAN
That never good report went with our calling, father. I have heard you
say, the poor look only to the advantages which we derive from them, and
overlook the accommodations which they receive from us. But the poor
<emphasis>are</emphasis> the poor, father, and have little leisure to make distinctions. I
wish we could give up this business.</p>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have not seen that idle fellow, Davenport?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No, indeed, father, since your injunction.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I take but my lawful profit. The law is not over favourable to us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marian is no judge of these things.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They call me oppressive, grinding.—I know not what—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Usurer, extortioner. Am I these things?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN
You are Marian's kind and careful father. That is enough for a child to
know.</p>
<p>FLINT
Here, girl, is a little box of jewels, which the necessities of a
foolish woman of quality have transferred into our true and lawful
possession. Go, place them with the trinkets that were your mother's.
They are all yours, Marian, if you do not cross me in your marriage. No
gentry shall match into this house, to flout their wife hereafter with
her parentage. I will hold this business with convulsive grasp to my
dying day. I will plague these <emphasis>poor</emphasis>, whom you speak so tenderly of.</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You frighten me, father. Do not frighten Marian.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have heard them say, There goes Flint—Flint, the cruel pawnbroker!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stay at home with Marian. You shall hear no ugly words to vex you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You shall ride in a gilded chariot upon the necks of these <emphasis>poor</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marian. Their tears shall drop pearls for my girl. Their sighs shall be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

good wind for us. They shall blow good for my girl. Put up the jewels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marian. [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Enter Lucy</emphasis>.</p>
<p>LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Miss, miss, your father has taken his hat, and is slept out, and Mr.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Davenport is on the stairs; and I came to tell you—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alas! who let him in?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Enter Davenport</emphasis>.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My dearest girl—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father will kill me, if he finds you have been here!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT
There is no time for explanations. I have positive information that your
father means, in less than a week, to dispose of you to that ugly
Saunders. The wretch has bragged of it to his acquaintance, and already
calls you <emphasis>his</emphasis>.</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O heavens!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT
Your resolution must be summary, as the time which calls for it. Mine or
his you must be, without delay. There is no safety for you under this
roof.</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is no father, if he would sacrifice you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But he is unhappy. Do not speak hard words of my father.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marian must exert her good sense.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY
(<emphasis>As if watching at the window.</emphasis>) O, miss, your father has suddenly
returned. I see him with Mr. Saunders, coming down the street. Mr.
Saunders, ma'am!</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Begone, begone, if you love me, Davenport.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You must go with me then, else here I am fixed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY
Aye, miss, you must go, as Mr. Davenport says. Here is your cloak, miss,
and your hat, and your gloves. Your father, ma'am—</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, where, where? Whither do you hurry me, Davenport?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Quickly, quickly, Marian. At the back door.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[<emphasis>Exit Marian with Davenport, reluctantly; in her flight still holding
the jewels.</emphasis>]</p>
<p>LUCY
Away—away. What a lucky thought of mine to say her father was coming!
he would never have got her off, else. Lord, Lord, I do love to help
lovers.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Exit, following them.</emphasis>]</p>

<p><strong>SCENE II.—<emphasis>A Butcher's Shop.</emphasis></strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>CUTLET. BEN.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Reach me down that book off the shelf, where the shoulder of veal hangs.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>BEN</strong></p>
<p>Is this it?</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No—this is "Flowers of Sentiment"—the other—aye, this is a good book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"An Argument against the Use of Animal Food. By J.R." <emphasis>That</emphasis> means</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Joseph Ritson. I will open it anywhere, and read just as it happens. One</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

cannot dip amiss in such books as these. The motto, I see, is from Pope.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I dare say, very much to the purpose. (<emphasis>Reads</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      "The lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Had he thy reason, would he sport and play?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Pleas'd to the last, he crops his flowery food,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And licks the hand"—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Bless us, is that saddle of mutton gone home to Mrs. Simpson's? It
should have gone an hour ago.</p>
<p>BEN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I was just going with it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Well go. Where was I? Oh!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      "And licks the hand just raised to shed its blood."</p>
<p>What an affecting picture! (<emphasis>turns over the leaves, and reads</emphasis>).</p>
<p>"It is probable that the long lives which are recorded of the people before
the flood, were owing to their being confined to a vegetable diet."</p>
<p>BEN
The young gentleman in Pullen's Row, Islington, that has got the
consumption, has sent to know if you can let him have a sweetbread.</p>
<p>CUTLET
Take two,—take all that are in the shop. What a disagreeable
interruption! (<emphasis>reads again</emphasis>). "Those fierce and angry passions, which
impel man to wage destructive war with man, may be traced to the ferment
in the blood produced by an animal diet."</p>
<p>BEN
The two pound of rump-steaks must go home to Mr. Molyneux's. He is in
training to fight Cribb.</p>
<p>CUTLET
Well, take them; go along, and do not trouble me with your disgusting
details.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Exit Ben.</emphasis>]</p>
<p>CUTLET
(<emphasis>Throwing down the book.</emphasis>) Why was I bred to this detestable business?
Was it not plain, that this trembling sensibility, which has marked my
character from earliest infancy, must for ever disqualify me for a
profession which—what do ye want? what do ye buy? O, it is only
somebody going past. I thought it had been a customer.—Why was not I
bred a glover, like my cousin Langston? to see him poke his two little
sticks into a delicate pair of real Woodstock—"A very little stretching
ma'am, and they will fit exactly"—Or a haberdasher, like my next-door
neighbour—"not a better bit of lace in all town, my lady—Mrs.
Breakstock took the last of it last Friday, all but this bit, which I
can afford to let your ladyship have a bargain—reach down that drawer
on your left hand, Miss Fisher."</p>
<p>(<emphasis>Enter in haste, Davenport, Marian, and Lucy.</emphasis>)</p>
<p>LUCY
This is the house I saw a bill up at, ma'am; and a droll creature the
landlord is.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have no time for nicety.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What do ye want? what do ye buy? O, it is only you, Mrs. Lucy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lucy whispers Cutlet.</emphasis></p>
<p>CUTLET
I have a set of apartments at the end of my garden. They are quite
detached from the shop. A single lady at present occupies the ground
floor.</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Aye, aye, any where.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In, in.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pretty lamb,—she seems agitated. <emphasis>Davenport and Marian go in with</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Cutlet.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY
I am mistaken if my young lady does not find an agreeable companion in
these apartments. Almost a namesake. Only the difference of Flyn, and
Flint. I have some errands to do, or I would stop and have some fun with
this droll butcher. <emphasis>Cutlet returns.</emphasis></p>
<p>CUTLET
Why, how odd this is! <emphasis>Your</emphasis> young lady knows <emphasis>my</emphasis> young lady. They are
as thick as flies.</p>
<p>LUCY
You may thank me for your new lodger, Mr. Cutlet.—But bless me, you do
not look well?</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To tell you the truth, I am rather heavy about the eyes. Want of sleep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I believe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Late hours, perhaps. Raking last night.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
No, that is not it, Mrs. Lucy. My repose was disturbed by a very
different cause from what you may imagine. It proceeded from too much
thinking.</p>
<p>LUCY
The deuce it did! and what, if I may be so bold, might be the subject of
your Night Thoughts?</p>
<p>CUTLET
The distresses of my fellow creatures. I never lay my head down on my
pillow, but I fall a thinking, how many at this very instant are
perishing. Some with cold—</p>
<p>LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What, in the midst of summer?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Aye. Not here, but in countries abroad, where the climate is different</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

from ours. Our summers are their winters, and <emphasis>vice versâ</emphasis>, you know.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some with cold—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY
What a canting rogue it is! I should like to trump up some fine story to
plague him. [<emphasis>Aside.</emphasis>]</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Others with hunger—some a prey to the rage of wild beasts—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He has got this by rote, out of some book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
Some drowning, crossing crazy bridges in the dark—some by the violence
of the devouring flame—</p>
<p>LUCY
I have it.—For that matter, you need not send your humanity a
travelling, Mr. Cutlet. For instance, last night—</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some by fevers, some by gun-shot wounds—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Only two streets off—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some in drunken quarrels—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY
(<emphasis>Aloud.</emphasis>) The butcher's shop at the corner.</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What were you saying about poor Cleaver?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY
He has found his ears at last. (<emphasis>Aside.</emphasis>) That he has had his house
burnt down.</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bless me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw four small children taken in at the green grocer's.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do you know if he is insured?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some say he is, but not to the full amount.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
Not to the full amount—how shocking! He killed more meat than any of
the trade between here and Carnaby market—and the poor babes—four of
them you say—what a melting sight!—he served some good customers about
Marybone—I always think more of the children in these cases than of the
fathers and mothers—Lady Lovebrown liked his veal better than any man's
in the market—I wonder whether her ladyship is engaged—I must go and
comfort poor Cleaver, however.—[<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>LUCY
Now is this pretender to humanity gone to avail himself of a neighbour's
supposed ruin to inveigle his customers from him. Fine feelings!—pshaw!
[<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>(<emphasis>Re-enter Cutlet</emphasis>.)</p>
<p>CUTLET
What a deceitful young hussey! there is not a word of truth in her.
There has been no fire. How can people play with one's feelings
so!—(<emphasis>sings</emphasis>)—"For tenderness formed"—No, I'll try the air I made
upon myself. The words may compose me—(<emphasis>sings</emphasis>).</p>
<p>        A weeping Londoner I am,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        A washer-woman was my dam;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        She bred me up in a cock-loft,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And fed my mind with sorrows soft:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        For when she wrung with elbows stout</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        From linen wet the water out,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The drops so like to tears did drip,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They gave my infant nerves the hyp.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Scarce three clean muckingers a week</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Would dry the brine that dew'd my cheek:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        So, while I gave my sorrows scope,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I almost ruin'd her in soap.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        My parish learning I did win</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        In ward of Farringdon-Within;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Where, after school, I did pursue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        My sports, as little boys will do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Cockchafers—none like me was found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To set them spinning round and round.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        O, how my tender heart would melt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To think what those poor varmin felt!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        I never tied tin-kettle, clog,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or salt-box to the tail of dog,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Without a pang more keen at heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Than he felt at his outward part.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        And when the poor thing clattered off,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To all the unfeeling mob a scoff,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Thought I, "What that dumb creature feels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        With half the parish at his heels!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Arrived, you see, to man's estate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The butcher's calling is my fate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Yet still I keep my feeling ways.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And leave the town on slaughtering days.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        At Kentish Town, or Highgate Hill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I sit, retired, beside some rill;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And tears bedew my glistening eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        To think my playful lambs must die!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        But when they're dead I sell their meat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        On shambles kept both clean and neat;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Sweet-breads also I guard full well,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And keep them from the blue-bottle.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Envy, with breath sharp as my steel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Has ne'er yet blown upon my veal;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And mouths of dames, and daintiest fops,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Do water at my nice lamb-chops.</p>

<p><strong>SCENE III.—A Street.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>(Davenport, solus.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT
Thus far have I secured my charming prize. I can appretiate, while I
lament, the delicacy which makes her refuse the protection of my
sister's roof. But who comes here?</p>
<p>(<emphasis>Enter Pendulous, agitated.</emphasis>)  It must be he. That fretful animal
motion—that face working up and down with uneasy sensibility, like new
yeast. Jack—Jack Pendulous!</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is your old friend, and very miserable.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT
Vapours, Jack. I have not known you fifteen years to have to guess at
your complaint. Why, they troubled you at school. Do you remember when
you had to speak the speech of Buckingham, where he is going to
execution?</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Execution!—he has certainly heard it. (<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What a pucker you were in overnight!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
May be so, may be so, Mr. Davenport. That was an imaginary scene. I have
had real troubles since.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pshaw! so you call every common accident.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do you call my case so common, then?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What case?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have not heard, then?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Positively not a word.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You must know I have been—(<emphasis>whispers</emphasis>)—tried for a felony since then.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nonsense!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
No subject for mirth, Mr. Davenport. A confounded short-sighted fellow
swore that I stopt him, and robbed him, on the York race-ground at nine
on a fine moonlight evening, when I was two hundred miles off in
Dorsetshire. These hands have been held up at a common bar.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ridiculous! it could not have gone so far.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
A great deal farther, I assure you, Mr. Davenport. I am ashamed to say
how far it went. You must know, that in the first shock and surprise of
the accusation, shame—you know I was always susceptible—shame put me
upon disguising my <emphasis>name</emphasis>, that, at all events, it might bring no
disgrace upon my family. I called myself <emphasis>James Thomson</emphasis>.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For heaven's sake, compose yourself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
I will. An old family ours, Mr. Davenport—never had a blot upon it till
now—a family famous for the jealousy of its honour for many
generations—think of that, Mr. Davenport—that felt a stain like a
wound—</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be calm, my dear friend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
This served the purpose of a temporary concealment well enough; but when
it came to the—<emphasis>alibi</emphasis>—I think they call it—excuse these technical
terms, they are hardly fit for the mouth of a gentleman, the
<emphasis>witnesses</emphasis>—that is another term—that I had sent for up from Melcombe
Regis, and relied upon for clearing up my character, by disclosing my
real name, <emphasis>John Pendulous</emphasis>—so discredited the cause which they came to
serve, that it had quite a contrary effect to what was intended. In
short, the usual forms passed, and you behold me here the miserablest of
mankind.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT
(<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>). He must be light-headed.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS
Not at all, Mr. Davenport. I hear what you say, though you speak it all
on one side, as they do at the playhouse.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT
The sentence could never have been carried into—pshaw!—you are
joking—the truth must have come out at last.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS
So it did, Mr. Davenport—just two minutes and a second too late by the
Sheriff's stop-watch. Time enough to save my life—my wretched life—but
an age too late for my honour. Pray, change the subject—the detail must
be as offensive to you.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT
With all my heart, to a more pleasing theme. The lovely Maria Flyn—are
you friends in that quarter, still? Have the old folks relented?</p>
<p>PENDULOUS
They are dead, and have left her mistress of her inclinations. But it
requires great strength of mind to—</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To what?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
To stand up against the sneers of the world. It is not every young lady
that feels herself confident against the shafts of ridicule, though
aimed by the hand of prejudice. Not but in her heart, I believe, she
prefers me to all mankind. But think what the world would say, if, in
defiance of the opinions of mankind, she should take to her arms
a—reprieved man!</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whims! You might turn the laugh of the world upon itself in a fortnight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These things are but nine days' wonders.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do you think so, Mr. Davenport?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where does she live?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
She has lodgings in the next street, in a sort of garden-house, that
belongs to one Cutlet. I have not seen her since the affair. I was going
there at her request.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why do you laugh?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The oddest fellow! I will tell you—But here he comes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Enter Cutlet.</emphasis></p>
<p>CUTLET
(<emphasis>To Davenport.</emphasis>) Sir, the young lady at my house is desirous you should
return immediately. She has heard something from home.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What do I hear?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DAVENPORT
'Tis her fears, I daresay. My dear Pendulous, you will excuse me?—I
must not tell him our situation at present, though it cost him a fit of
jealousy. We shall have fifty opportunities for explanation. [<emphasis>Exit.</emphasis>]</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Does that gentleman visit the lady at your lodgings?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
He is quite familiar there, I assure you. He is all in all with her, as
they say.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS
It is but too plain. Fool that I have been, not to suspect that, while
she pretended scruples, some rival was at the root of her infidelity!</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You seem distressed, Sir. Bless me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am, friend, above the reach of comfort.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Consolation, then, can be to no purpose?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

None.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am so happy to have met with him!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wretch, wretch, wretch!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
There he goes! How he walks about biting his nails! I would not exchange
this luxury of unavailing pity for worlds.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stigmatized by the world—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My case exactly. Let us compare notes.</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

For an accident which—</p>

By an invidious exclusion disqualified for sitting upon a jury at all—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tried, cast, and—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

HANGED, Sir, HANGED by the neck, till I was—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bless me!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
Why should not I publish it to the whole world, since she, whose
prejudice alone I wished to overcome, deserts me?</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lord have mercy upon us! not so bad as that comes to, I hope?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When she joins in the judgment of an illiberal world against me—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
You said HANGED, Sir—that is, I mean, perhaps I mistook you. How
ghastly he looks!</p>
<p>PENDULOUS
Fear me not, my friend. I am no ghost—though I heartily wish I were
one.</p>
<p>CUTLET</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, then, ten to one you were—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
<emphasis>Cut down.</emphasis> The odious word shall out, though it choak me.</p>
<p>CUTLET
Your case must have some things in it very curious. I daresay you kept a
journal of your sensations.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sensations!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
Aye, while you were being—you know what I mean. They say persons in
your situation have lights dancing before their eyes—blueish. But then
the worst of all is coming to one's self again.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Plagues, furies, tormentors! I shall go mad! [<emphasis>Exit.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>CUTLET
There, he says he shall go mad. Well, my head has not been very right of
late. It goes with a whirl and a buzz somehow. I believe I must not
think so deeply. Common people that don't reason know nothing of these
aberrations.</p>
<p>      Great wits go mad, and small ones only dull;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Distracting cares vex not the empty skull:</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><strong>FLINT. WILLIAM.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
I have overwalked myself, and am quite exhausted. Tell Marian to come
and play to me.</p>
<p>WILLIAM</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall, Sir. [<emphasis>Exit.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
I have been troubled with an evil spirit of late; I think an evil
spirit. It goes and comes, as my daughter is with or from me. It cannot
stand before her gentle look, when, to please her father, she takes down
her music-book. <emphasis>Enter William.</emphasis></p>
<p>WILLIAM</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Miss Marian went out soon after you, and is not returned.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That is a pity—That is a pity. Where can the foolish girl be gadding?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILLIAM</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The shopmen say she went out with Mr. Davenport.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Davenport? Impossible.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>WILLIAM
They say they are sure it was he, by the same token that they saw her
slip into his hand, when she was past the door, the casket which you
gave her.</p>
<p>FLINT
Gave her, William! I only intrusted it to her. She has robbed me. Marian
is a thief. You must go to the Justice, William, and get out a warrant
against her immediately. Do you help them in the description. Put in
"Marian Flint," in plain words—no remonstrances, William—"daughter of
Reuben Flint,"—no remonstrances, but do it—</p>
<p>WILLIAM</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, sir—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
I am rock, absolute rock, to all that you can say—A piece of solid
rock.—What is it that makes my legs to fail, and my whole frame to
totter thus? It has been my over walking. I am very faint. Support me
in, William. [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>]</p>

<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>The Apartment of Miss Flyn.</emphasis></strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>MISS FLYN. BETTY.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
'Tis past eleven. Every minute I expect Mr. Pendulous here. What a
meeting do I anticipate!</p>
<p>BETTY
Anticipate, truly! what other than a joyful meeting can it be between
two agreed lovers who have been parted these four months?</p>
<p>MISS FLYN
But in that cruel space what accidents have happened!—(<emphasis>aside</emphasis>)—As
yet I perceive she is ignorant of this unfortunate affair.</p>
<p>BETTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lord, madam, what accidents? He has not had a fall or a tumble, has he?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is not coming upon crutches?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
Not exactly a fall—(<emphasis>aside</emphasis>)—I wish I had courage to admit her to my
confidence.</p>
<p>BETTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If his neck is whole, his heart is so too, I warrant it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
His neck!—(<emphasis>aside</emphasis>)—She certainly mistrusts something. He writes me
word that this must be his last interview.</p>
<p>BETTY
Then I guess the whole business. The wretch is unfaithful. Some creature
or other has got him into a noose.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A noose!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BETTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I shall never more see him hang——</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hang, did you say, Betty?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BETTY
About that dear, fond neck, I was going to add, madam, but you
interrupted me.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN
I can no longer labour with a secret which oppresses me thus. Can you be
trusty?</p>
<p>BETTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who, I, madam?—(<emphasis>aside</emphasis>)—Lord, I am so glad. Now I shall know all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
This letter discloses the reason of his unaccountable long absence from
me. Peruse it, and say if we have not reason to be unhappy.</p>
<p><emphasis>(Betty retires to the window to read the letter, Mr. Pendulous
enters.)</emphasis></p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My dear Pendulous!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
Maria!—nay, shun the embraces of a disgraced man, who comes but to tell
you that you must renounce his society for ever.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, Pendulous, avoid me not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
<emphasis>(Aside.)</emphasis> That was tender. I may be mistaken. Whilst I stood on
honourable terms, Maria might have met my caresses without a blush.</p>
<p><emphasis>(Betty, who has not attended to the entrance of Pendulous, through her
eagerness to read the letter, comes forward.)</emphasis></p>
<p>BETTY
Ha! ha! ha! What a funny story, madam; and is this all you make such a
fuss about? I should not care if twenty of my lovers had been——
(<emphasis>seeing Pendulous</emphasis>)—Lord, Sir, I ask pardon.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are we not alone, then?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis only Betty—my old servant. You remember Betty?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What letter is that?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O! something from her sweetheart, I suppose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BETTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, ma'am, that is all. I shall die of laughing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have not surely been shewing her——</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
I must be ingenuous. You must know, then, that I was just giving Betty a
hint—as you came in.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A hint!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, of our unfortunate embarrassment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My letter!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I thought it as well that she should know it at first.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
'Tis mighty well, madam. 'Tis as it should be. I was ordained to be a
wretched laughing-stock to all the world; and it is fit that our drabs
and our servant wenches should have their share of the amusement.</p>
<p>BETTY
Marry come up! Drabs and servant wenches! and this from a person in his
circumstances!</p>
<p><emphasis>(Betty flings herself out of the room, muttering.)</emphasis></p>
<p>MISS FLYN
I understand not this language. I was prepared to give my Pendulous a
tender meeting. To assure him, that however, in the eyes of the
superficial and the censorious, he may have incurred a partial
degradation, in the esteem of one, at least, he stood as high as ever.
That it was not in the power of a ridiculous <emphasis>accident,</emphasis> involving no
guilt, no shadow of imputation, to separate two hearts, cemented by
holiest vows, as ours have been. This untimely repulse to my affections
may awaken scruples in me, which hitherto, in tenderness to you, I have
suppressed.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS
I very well understand what you call tenderness, madam; but in some
situations, pity—pity—is the greatest insult.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN
I can endure no longer. When you are in a calmer mood, you will be sorry
that you have wrung my heart so. <emphasis>[Exit.]</emphasis></p>
<p>PENDULOUS
Maria! She is gone—in tears. Yet it seems she has had her scruples. She
said she had tried to smother them. Mermaid Betty intimated as much.</p>
<p><emphasis>Re-enter Betty.</emphasis></p>
<p>BETTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Never mind Retty, sir; depend upon it she will never 'peach.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Peach!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BETTY
Lord, sir, these scruples will blow over. Go to her again, when she is
in a better humour. You know we must stand off a little at first, to
save appearances.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Appearances! <emphasis>we!</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>BETTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It will be decent to let some time elapse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Time elapse!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>        Lost, wretched Pendulous! to scorn betrayed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The scoff alike of mistress and of maid!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        What now remains for thee, forsaken man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But to complete thy fate's abortive plan,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And finish what the feeble law began?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[<emphasis>Exeunt.</emphasis>]</p>
<p><emphasis>Re-enter Miss Flyn, with Marian.</emphasis></p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now both our lovers are gone, I hope my friend will have less reserve.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You must consider this apartment as yours while you stay here. 'Tis</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

larger and more commodious than your own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN
You are kind, Maria. My sad story I have troubled you with. I have some
jewels here, which I unintentionally brought away. I have only to beg,
that you will take the trouble to restore them to my father; and,
without disclosing my present situation, to tell him, that my next
step—with or without the concurrence of Mr. Davenport—shall be to
throw myself at his feet, and beg to be forgiven. I dare not see him
till you have explored the way for me. I am convinced I was tricked into
this elopement.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your commands shall be obeyed implicitly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are good (<emphasis>agitated</emphasis>).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
Moderate your apprehensions, my sweet friend. I too have known my
sorrows—(<emphasis>smiling</emphasis>).—You have heard of the ridiculous affair.</p>
<p>MARIAN
Between Mr. Pendulous and you? Davenport informed me of it, and we both
took the liberty of blaming the over-niceness of your scruples.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN
You mistake. The refinement is entirely on the part of my lover. He
thinks me not nice enough. I am obliged to feign a little reluctance,
that he may not take quite a distaste to me. Will you believe it, that
he turns my very constancy into a reproach, and declares, that a woman
must be devoid of all delicacy, that, after a thing of that sort, could
endure the sight of her husband in——</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In what?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The sight of a man at all in——</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I comprehend you not.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In—in a—<emphasis>(whispers)</emphasis>—night cap, my dear; and now the mischief is out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is there no way to cure him?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
None, unless I were to try the experiment, by placing myself in the
hands of justice for a little while, how far an equality in misfortune
might breed a sympathy in sentiment. Our reputations would be both upon
a level, then, you know. What think you of a little innocent
shop-lifting, in sport?</p>
<p>MARIAN
And by that contrivance to be taken before a magistrate? the project
sounds oddly.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet I am more than half persuaded it is feasible.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Enter Betty.</emphasis></p>

<p>

Mr. Davenport is below, ma'am, and desires to speak with you.</p>

You will excuse me—<emphasis>(going—turning back.)</emphasis>—You will remember the
casket? <emphasis>[Exit.]</emphasis></p>

Aye, aye, Flyn or Flint. 'Tis all one. Some write plain Mary, and some
put ann after it. I come about a casket.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN
I guess the whole business. He takes me for my friend. Something may
come out of this. I will humour him.</p>
<p>OFFICER
<emphasis>(Aside)</emphasis>—Answers the description to a tittle. "Soft, grey eyes, pale
complexion,"——</p>
<p>MISS FLYN
Yet I have been told by flatterers that my eyes were blue—<emphasis>(takes out
a pocket-glass)</emphasis>—I hope I look pretty tolerably to-day.</p>
<p>OFFICER
Blue!—they are a sort of blueish-gray, now I look better; and as for
colour, that comes and goes. Blushing is often a sign of a hardened
offender. Do you know any thing of a casket?</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here is one which a friend has just delivered to my keeping.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OFFICER
And which I must beg leave to secure, together with your ladyship's
person. "Garnets, pearls, diamond-bracelet,"—here they are, sure
enough.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Indeed, I am innocent.</p>

Police wit! Have you a warrant?</p>

Tolerably cool that! Here it is, signed by Justice Golding, at the
requisition of Reuben Flint, who deposes that you have robbed him.</p>

Before we proceed to extremities, Mr. Flint, let me entreat you to
consider the consequences. What will the world say to your exposing your
own child?</p>

The world is not my friend. I belong to a profession which has long
brought me acquainted with its injustice. I return scorn for scorn, and
desire its censure above its plaudits.</p>

'Tis not the silly baubles I regard. Are you a man? are you a father?

desecrated? Deep in some pit first I would bury them.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet pause a little. Consider. An only child.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
Only, only,—there, it is that stings me, makes me mad. She was the only
thing I had to love me—to bear me up against the nipping injuries of
the world. I prate when I should act. Bring in your prisoner.</p>
<p><emphasis>(The Justice makes signs to an Officer, who goes out, and returns with

<p>

What mockery of my sight is here? This is no daughter.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>OFFICER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Daughter, or no daughter, she has confessed to this casket.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
<emphasis>(Handling it.)</emphasis> The very same. Was it in the power of these pale
splendours to dazzle the sight of honesty—to put out the regardful eye
of piety and daughter-love? Why, a poor glow-worm shews more brightly.
Bear witness how I valued them—<emphasis>(tramples on them)</emphasis>.—Fair lady, know
you aught of my child?</p>

Let him be sent for. I believe the gentleman to be respectable, and will
accept his security.</p>

I am in a maze where all this will end.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
But here comes one who, if I mistake not, will guide us out of all our
difficulties.</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Marian and Davenport.</emphasis></p>
<p>MARIAN
<emphasis>(Kneeling.)</emphasis> My dear father!</p>
<p>FLINT</p>

Do I dream?</p>

I am your Marian.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

The casket—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me clear up the rest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The casket—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
Was inadvertently in your daughter's hand, when, by an artifice of her
maid Lucy,—set on, as she confesses, by this gentleman here,—</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I plead guilty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
She was persuaded, that you were in a hurry going to marry her to an
object of her dislike; nay, that he was actually in the house for the
purpose. The speed of her flight admitted not of her depositing the
jewels; but to me, who have been her inseparable companion since she
quitted your roof, she intrusted the return of them; which the
precipitate measures of this gentleman <emphasis>(pointing to the Officer)</emphasis> alone
prevented. Mr. Cutlet, whom I see coming, can witness this to be true.</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Cutlet, in haste.</emphasis></p>
<p>CUTLET
Aye, poor lamb! poor lamb! I can witness. I have run in such a haste,
hearing how affairs stood, that I have left my shambles without a
protector. If your worship had seen how she cried <emphasis>(pointing to
Marian),</emphasis> and trembled, and insisted upon being brought to her father.
Mr. Davenport here could not stay her.</p>
<p>FLINT
I can forbear no longer. Marian, will you play once again, to please
your old father?</p>
<p>MARIAN
I have a good mind to make you buy me a new grand piano for your naughty
suspicions of me.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What is to become of me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will do more than that. The poor lady shall have her jewels again.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall she?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
Upon reasonable terms <emphasis>(smiling).</emphasis> And now, I suppose, the court may
adjourn.</p>
<p>DAVENPORT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marian!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
I guess what is passing in your mind, Mr. Davenport; but you have
behaved upon the whole so like a man of honour, that it will give me
pleasure, if you will visit at my house for the future; but <emphasis>(smiling)</emphasis>
not clandestinely, Marian.</p>
<p>MARIAN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hush, father.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT
I own I had prejudices against gentry. But I have met with so much
candour and kindness among my betters this day—from this gentleman in
particular—<emphasis>(turning to the Justice)</emphasis>—that I begin to think of
leaving off business, and setting up for a gentleman myself.</p>
<p>JUSTICE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have the feelings of one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>FLINT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marian will not object to it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUSTICE
But <emphasis>(turning to Miss Flyn)</emphasis> what motive could induce this lady to take
so much disgrace upon herself, when a word's explanation might have
relieved her?</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This gentleman <emphasis>(turning to Pendulous)</emphasis> can explain.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The devil!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
This gentleman, I repeat it, whose backwardness in concluding a long and
honourable suit from a mistaken delicacy—</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN
Drove me upon the expedient of involving myself in the same disagreeable
embarrassments with himself, in the hope that a more perfect sympathy
might subsist between us for the future.</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I see it—I see it all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUSTICE
(<emphasis>To Pendulous.</emphasis>) You were then tried at York?</p>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I was—CAST—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>JUSTICE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Condemned—</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>PENDULOUS
EXECUTED.</strong></p>
<p>JUSTICE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS
CUT DOWN and CAME TO LIFE AGAIN. False delicacy, adieu! The true sort,
which this lady has manifested—by an expedient which at first sight
might seem a little unpromising, has cured me of the other. We are now
on even terms.</p>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And may—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry,—I know it was your word.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And make a very quiet—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>PENDULOUS</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Exemplary—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>MISS FLYN</p>
<empty-line/>

Agreeing pair of—</p>

<p><strong>PENDULOUS
ACQUITTED FELONS.</strong></p>
<p>FLINT
And let the prejudiced against our profession acknowledge, that a

<p><strong>MR. SELBY, KATHERINE.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Do not too far mistake me, gentlest wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I meant to chide your virtues, not yourself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And those too with allowance. I have not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Been blest by thy fair side with five white years</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of smooth and even wedlock, now to touch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With any strain of harshness on a string</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Hath yielded me such music. 'Twas the quality</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of a too grateful nature in my Katherine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That to the lame performance of some vows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And common courtesies of man to wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Attributing too much, hath sometimes seem'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To esteem in favours, what in that blest union</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Are but reciprocal and trivial dues,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As fairly yours as mine: 'twas this I thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Gently to reprehend.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In friendship's barter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The riches we exchange should hold some level,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And corresponding worth. Jewels for toys</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Demand some thanks thrown in. You took me, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To that blest haven of my peace, your bosom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      An orphan founder'd in the world's black storm.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Poor, you have made me rich; from lonely maiden,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your cherish'd and your full-accompanied wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But to divert the subject: Kate too fond,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I would not wrest your meanings; else that word</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Accompanied, and full-accompanied too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Might raise a doubt in some men, that their wives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Haply did think their company too long;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And over-company, we know by proof,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Is worse than no attendance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I must guess,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You speak this of the Widow—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      'Twas a bolt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      At random shot; but if it hit, believe me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I am most sorry to have wounded you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Through a friend's side. I know not how we have swerved</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      From our first talk. I was to caution you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Against this fault of a too grateful nature:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which, for some girlish obligations past,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In that relenting season of the heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When slightest favours pass for benefits</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of endless binding, would entail upon you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      An iron slavery of obsequious duty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To the proud will of an imperious woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The favours are not slight to her I owe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Slight or not slight, the tribute she exacts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Cancels all dues—<emphasis>[A voice within.]</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      even now I hear her call you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In such a tone, as lordliest mistresses</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Expect a slave's attendance. Prithee, Kate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Let her expect a brace of minutes or so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Say, you are busy. Use her by degrees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To some less hard exactions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I conjure you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Detain me not. I will return—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Sweet wife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Use thy own pleasure—<emphasis>[Exit Katherine.]</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      but it troubles me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A visit of three days, as was pretended,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Spun to ten tedious weeks, and no hint given</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When she will go! I would this buxom Widow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Were a thought handsomer! I'd fairly try</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My Katherine's constancy; make desperate love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In seeming earnest; and raise up such broils,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That she, not I, should be the first to warn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The insidious guest depart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      <emphasis>Re-enter Katherine.</emphasis></p>
<p>      So soon return'd!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What was our Widow's will?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A trifle, Sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Some toilet service-to adjust her head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or help to stick a pin in the right place—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Indeed 'twas none of these.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      or new vamp up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The tarnish'd cloak she came in. I have seen her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Demand such service from thee, as her maid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Twice told to do it, would blush angry-red,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And pack her few clothes up. Poor fool! fond slave!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And yet my dearest Kate!—This day at least</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (It is our wedding-day) we spend in freedom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And will forget our Widow.—Philip, our coach—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Why weeps my wife? You know, I promised you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      An airing o'er the pleasant Hampshire downs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To the blest cottage on the green hill side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where first I told my love. I wonder much,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      If the crimson parlour hath exchanged its hue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For colours not so welcome. Faded though it be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      It will not shew less lovely than the tinge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of this faint red, contending with the pale,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where once the full-flush'd health gave to this cheek</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      An apt resemblance to the fruit's warm side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That bears my Katherine's name.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      Our carriage, Philip.</p>
<p>      <emphasis>Enter a Servant</emphasis>.</p>
<p>      Now, Robin, what make you here?</p>
<p>      SERVANT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      May it please you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The coachman has driven out with Mrs. Frampton.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He had no orders—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SERVANT</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      None, Sir, that I know of,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But from the lady, who expects some letter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      At the next Post Town.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Go, Robin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      [<emphasis>Exit Servant</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>      How is this?</p>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I came to tell you so, but fear'd your anger—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      It was ill done though of this Mistress Frampton,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This forward Widow. But a ride's poor loss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Imports not much. In to your chamber, love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where you with music may beguile the hour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      While I am tossing over dusty tomes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Till our most reasonable friend returns.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I am all obedience.      [<emphasis>Exit Katherine</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Too obedient, Kate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And to too many masters. I can hardly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      On such a day as this refrain to speak</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My sense of this injurious friend, this pest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This household evil, this close-clinging fiend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In rough terms to my wife. 'Death! my own servants</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Controll'd above me! orders countermanded!'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What next? _[Servant enters and announces the Sister]</p>

<p>

      This day's return. 'Twas well done.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You seem ruffled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In years gone by this day was used to be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The smoothest of the year. Your honey turn'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      So soon to gall?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Gall'd am I, and with cause,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And rid to death, yet cannot get a riddance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Nay, scarce a ride, by this proud Widow's leave.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Something you wrote me of a Mistress Frampton.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She came at first a meek admitted guest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Pretending a short stay; her whole deportment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Seem'd as of one obliged. A slender trunk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The wardrobe of her scant and ancient clothing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Bespoke no more. But in a few days her dress,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her looks, were proudly changed. And now she flaunts it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In jewels stolen or borrow'd from my wife;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Who owes her some strange service, of what nature</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I must be kept in ignorance. Katherine's meek</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And gentle spirit cowers beneath her eye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As spell-bound by some witch.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Some mystery hangs on it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How bears she in her carriage towards yourself?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As one who fears, and yet not greatly cares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For my displeasure. Sometimes I have thought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A secret glance would tell me she could love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      If I but gave encouragement. Before me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She keeps some moderation; but is never</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Closeted with my wife, but in the end</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I find my Katherine in briny tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      From the small chamber, where she first was lodged,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The gradual fiend by specious wriggling arts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Has now ensconced herself in the best part</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of this large mansion; calls the left wing her own;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Commands my servants, equipage.—I hear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her hated tread. What makes she back so soon?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      <emphasis>Enter Mrs. Frampton.</emphasis></p>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O, I am jolter'd, bruised, and shook to death,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With your vile Wiltshire roads. The villain Philip</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Chose, on my conscience, the perversest tracks,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And stoniest hard lanes in all the county,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Till I was fain get out, and so walk back,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My errand unperform'd at Andover.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And I shall love the knave for ever after.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A friend with you!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My eldest sister, Lucy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Come to congratulate this returning morn.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Sister, my wife's friend, Mistress Frampton.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Pray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Be seated. For your brother's sake, you are welcome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I had thought this day to have spent in homely fashion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With the good couple, to whose hospitality</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I stand so far indebted. But your coming</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Makes it a feast.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>      LUCY</strong></p>
<p>      She does the honours naturally—[<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>      SELBY</strong></p>
<p>      As if she were the mistress of the house—[<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I love to be at home with loving friends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To stand on ceremony with obligations,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Is to restrain the obliger. That old coach, though,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of yours jumbles one strangely.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I shall order</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      An equipage soon, more easy to you, madam—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To drive her and her pride to Lucifer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I hope he means.      [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I must go trim myself; this humbled garb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Would shame a wedding feast. I have your leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For a short absence?—and your Katherine—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You'll find her in her closet—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Fare you well, then.  [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How like you her assurance?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Even so well,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That if this Widow were my guest, not yours,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She should have coach enough, and scope to ride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My merry groom should in a trice convey her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To Sarum Plain, and set her down at Stonehenge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To pick her path through those antiques at leisure;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She should take sample of our Wiltshire flints.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O, be not lightly jealous! nor surmise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That to a wanton bold-faced thing like this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your modest shrinking Katherine could impart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Secrets of any worth, especially</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Secrets that touch'd your peace. If there be aught,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My life upon't, 'tis but some girlish story</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of a First Love; which even the boldest wife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Might modestly deny to a husband's ear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Much more your timid and too sensitive Katherine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I think it is no more; and will dismiss</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My further fears, if ever I have had such.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Shall we go walk? I'd see your gardens, brother;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And how the new trees thrive, I recommended.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your Katherine is engaged now—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I'll attend you.     [<emphasis>Exeunt.</emphasis>]</p>

<p><strong>SCENE.—Servants' Hall.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      HOUSEKEEPER, PHILIP, <emphasis>and</emphasis> OTHERS, <emphasis>laughing</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      HOUSEKEEPER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Our Lady's guest, since her short ride, seems ruffled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And somewhat in disorder. Philip, Philip,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I do suspect some roguery. Your mad tricks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Will some day cost you a good place, I warrant.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      PHILIP</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Good Mistress Jane, our serious housekeeper,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And sage Duenna to the maids and scullions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      We must have leave to laugh; our brains are younger,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And undisturb'd with care of keys and pantries.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      We are wild things.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      BUTLER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Good Philip, tell us all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Ay, as you live, tell, tell—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      PHILIP</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Mad fellows, you shall have it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The Widow's bell rang lustily and loud—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      BUTLER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I think that no one can mistake her ringing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      WAITING-MAID</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Our Lady's ring is soft sweet music to it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      More of entreaty hath it than command.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      PHILIP</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I lose my story, if you interrupt me thus.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The bell, I say, rang fiercely; and a voice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      More shrill than bell, call'd out for "Coachman Philip."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I straight obey'd, as 'tis my name and office.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      "Drive me," quoth she, "to the next market town,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where I have hope of letters." I made haste.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Put to the horses, saw her safely coach'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And drove her—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      WAITING-MAID</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      —By the straight high-road to Andover,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I guess—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      PHILIP</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Pray, warrant things within your knowledge,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Good Mistress Abigail; look to your dressings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And leave the skill in horses to the coachman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      BUTLER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He'll have his humour; best not interrupt him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      PHILIP</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      'Tis market-day, thought I; and the poor beasts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Meeting such droves of cattle and of people,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      May take a fright; so down the lane I trundled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where Goodman Dobson's crazy mare was founder'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And where the flints were biggest, and ruts widest,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      By ups and downs, and such bone-cracking motions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      We flounder'd on a furlong, till my madam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In policy, to save the few joints left her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Betook her to her feet, and there we parted.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      ALL</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Ha! ha! ha!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      BUTLER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Hang her! 'tis pity such as she should ride.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      WAITING-MAID</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I think she is a witch; I have tired myself out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With sticking pins in her pillow; still she 'scapes them—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      BUTLER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And I with helping her to mum for claret,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But never yet could cheat her dainty palate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      HOUSEKEEPER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Well, well, she is the guest of our good Mistress,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And so should be respected. Though I think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Our Master cares not for her company,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He would ill brook we should express so much,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      By rude discourtesies, and short attendance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Being but servants. (<emphasis>A bell rings furiously.</emphasis>) 'Tis her bell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        speaks now;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Good, good, bestir yourselves: who knows who's wanted?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      BUTLER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But 'twas a merry trick of Philip coachman.  [<emphasis>Exeunt.</emphasis>]</p>

<p>MRS. FRAMPTON, KATHERINE, working.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I am thinking, child, how contrary our fates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Have traced our lots through life. Another needle,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This works untowardly. An heiress born</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To splendid prospects, at our common school</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I was as one above you all, not of you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Had my distinct prerogatives; my freedoms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Denied to you. Pray, listen—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I must hear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What you are pleased to speak!—How my heart sinks here!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      [<emphasis>Aside.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My chamber to myself, my separate maid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My coach, and so forth.—Not that needle, simple one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With the great staring eye fit for a Cyclops!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Mine own are not so blinded with their griefs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But I could make a shift to thread a smaller.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A cable or a camel might go through this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And never strain for the passage.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>      KATHERINE</strong></p>
<p>      I will fit you.—</p>

<p>

      Intolerable tyranny!       [<emphasis>Aside.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Quick, quick;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You were not once so slack.—As I was saying,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not a young thing among ye, but observed me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Above the mistress. Who but I was sought to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In all your dangers, all your little difficulties,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your girlish scrapes? I was the scape-goat still,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To fetch you off; kept all your secrets, some,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Perhaps, since then—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      No more of that, for mercy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      If you'd not have me, sinking at your feet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Cleave the cold earth for comfort.   [<emphasis>Kneels.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This to me?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This posture to your friend had better suited</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The orphan Katherine in her humble school-days</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To the <emphasis>then</emphasis> rich heiress, than the wife of Selby,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of wealthy Mr. Selby,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To the poor widow Frampton, sunk as she is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Come, come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      'Twas something, or 'twas nothing, that I said;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I did not mean to fright you, sweetest bed-fellow!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You once were so, but Selby now engrosses you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I'll make him give you up a night or so;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In faith I will: that we may lie, and talk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Old tricks of school-days over.</p>

<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Hear me, madam—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not by that name. Your friend—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My truest friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And saviour of my honour!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>

<p>

      This sounds better;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You still shall find me such.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That you have graced</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Our poor house with your presence hitherto,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Has been my greatest comfort, the sole solace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of my forlorn and hardly guess'd estate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You have been pleased</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To accept some trivial hospitalities,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In part of payment of a long arrear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I owe to you, no less than for my life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You speak my services too large.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Nay, less;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For what an abject thing were life to me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Without your silence on my dreadful secret!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And I would wish the league we have renew'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Might be perpetual—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Have a care, fine madam! [<emphasis>Aside.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That one house still might hold us. But my husband</p>

      Has shown himself of late—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How Mistress Selby?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not, not impatient. You misconstrue him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He honours, and he loves, nay, he must love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The friend of his wife's youth. But there are moods</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In which—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I understand you;—in which husbands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And wives that love, may wish to be alone,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To nurse the tender fits of new-born dalliance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      After a five years' wedlock.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Was that well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or charitably put? do these pale cheeks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Proclaim a wanton blood? this wasting form</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Seem a fit theatre for Levity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To play his love-tricks on; and act such follies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As even in Affection's first bland Moon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Have less of grace than pardon in best wedlocks?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I was about to say, that there are times,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When the most frank and sociable man</p>
<empty-line/>

      May surfeit on most loved society,</p>

<p>

      To my company—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Ay, your's, or mine, or any one's. Nay, take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not this unto yourself. Even in the newness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of our first married loves 'twas sometimes so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For solitude, I have heard my Selby say,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Is to the mind as rest to the corporal functions;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And he would call it oft, the <emphasis>day's soft sleep.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What is your drift? and whereto tends this speech,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Rhetorically labour'd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That you would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Abstain but from our house a month, a week;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I make request but for a single day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A month, a week, a day! A single hour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In every week, and month, and the long year,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And all the years to come! My footing here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Slipt once, recovers never. From the state</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of gilded roofs, attendance, luxuries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Parks, gardens, sauntering walks, or wholesome rides,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To the bare cottage on the withering moor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where I myself am servant to myself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or only waited on by blackest thoughts—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I sink, if this be so. No; here I sit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Then I am lost for ever!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      [<emphasis>Sinks at her feet—curtain drops.</emphasis>]</p>

<p><strong>SCENE.—<emphasis>An Apartment, contiguous to the last</emphasis>.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>SELBY, <emphasis>as if listening</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The sounds have died away. What am I changed to?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What do I here, list'ning like to an abject,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or heartless wittol, that must hear no good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      If he hear aught? "This shall to the ear of your husband."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      It was the Widow's word. I guess'd some mystery,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And the solution with a vengeance comes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What can my wife have left untold to me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That must be told by proxy? I begin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To call in doubt the course of her life past</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Under my very eyes. She hath not been good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not virtuous, not discreet; she hath not outrun</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My wishes still with prompt and meek observance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Perhaps she is not fair, sweet-voiced; her eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not like the dove's; all this as well may be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As that she should entreasure up a secret</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In the peculiar closet of her breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And grudge it to my ear. It is my right</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To claim the halves in any truth she owns,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As much as in the babe I have by her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Upon whose face henceforth I fear to look,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Lest I should fancy in its innocent brow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Some strange shame written.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      <emphasis>Enter Lucy</emphasis>.</p>
<p>      Sister, an anxious word with you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      From out the chamber, where my wife but now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Held talk with her encroaching friend, I heard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (Not of set purpose heark'ning, but by chance)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A voice of chiding, answer'd by a tone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of replication, such as the meek dove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Makes, when the kite has clutch'd her. The high Widow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Was loud and stormy. I distinctly heard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      One threat pronounced—"Your husband shall know all."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I am no listener, sister; and I hold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A secret, got by such unmanly shift,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The pitiful'st of thefts; but what mine ear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I not intending it, receives perforce,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I count my lawful prize. Some subtle meaning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Lurks in this fiend's behaviour; which, by force,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or fraud, I must make mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The gentlest means</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Are still the wisest. What, if you should press</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your wife to a disclosure?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I have tried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      All gentler means; thrown out low hints, which, though</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Merely suggestions still, have never fail'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To blanch her cheek with fears. Roughlier to insist,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Would be to kill, where I but meant to heal.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your own description gave that Widow out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As one not much precise, nor over coy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And nice to listen to a suit of love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What if you feign'd a courtship, putting on,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (To work the secret from her easy faith,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For honest ends, a most dishonest seeming?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I see your drift, and partly meet your counsel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But must it not in me appear prodigious,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To say the least, unnatural, and suspicious,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To move hot love, where I have shewn cool scorn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And undissembled looks of blank aversion?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Vain woman is the dupe of her own charms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And easily credits the resistless power,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That in besieging Beauty lies, to cast down</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The slight-built fortress of a casual hate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I am resolved—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Success attend your wooing!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>

      And I'll about it roundly, my wise sister. [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.]</p>

<p><strong>MR. SELBY. MRS. FRAMPTON.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A fortunate encounter, Mistress Frampton.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My purpose was, if you could spare so much</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      From your sweet leisure, a few words in private.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What mean his alter'd tones? These looks to me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Whose glances yet he has repell'd with coolness?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Is the wind changed? I'll veer about with it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And meet him in all fashions.      [<emphasis>Aside.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      All my leisure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Feebly bestow'd upon my kind friends here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Would not express a tithe of the obligements</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I every hour incur.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      No more of that.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I know not why, my wife hath lost of late</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Much of her cheerful spirits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      It was my topic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To-day; and every day, and all day long,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I still am chiding with her. "Child," I said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And said it pretty roundly—it may be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I was too peremptory—we elder school-fellows,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Presuming on the advantage of a year</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or two, which, in that tender time, seem'd much,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In after years, much like to elder sisters,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Are prone to keep the authoritative style,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When time has made the difference most ridiculous—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The observation's shrewd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      "Child," I was saying,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      "If some wives had obtained a lot like yours,"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And then perhaps I sigh'd, "they would not sit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In corners moping, like to sullen moppets</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That want their will, but dry their eyes, and look</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Their cheerful husbands in the face," perhaps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I said, their Selby's, "with proportion'd looks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of honest joy."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You do suspect no jealousy?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What is his import? Whereto tends his speech?    [<emphasis>Aside.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of whom, of what, should she be jealous, sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I do not know, but women have their fancies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And underneath a cold indifference,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or show of some distaste, husbands have mask'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A growing fondness for a female friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which the wife's eye was sharp enough to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Before the friend had wit to find it out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You do not quit us soon?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      'Tis as I find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your Katherine profits by my lessons, sir.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Means this man honest? Is there no deceit?    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She cannot chuse.—Well, well, I have been thinking,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And if the matter were to do again—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What matter, sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This idle bond of wedlock;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      These sour-sweet briars, fetters of harsh silk;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I might have made, I do not say a better,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But a more fit choice in a wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The parch'd ground,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In hottest Julys, drinks not in the showers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      More greedily than I his words!    [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My humour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Is to be frank and jovial; and that man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Affects me best, who most reflects me in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My most free temper.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Were you free to chuse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As jestingly I'll put the supposition,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Without a thought reflecting on your Katherine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What sort of woman would you make your choice?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I like your humour, and will meet your jest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She should be one about my Katherine's age;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But not so old, by some ten years, in gravity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      One that would meet my mirth, sometimes outrun it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      No puling, pining moppet, as you said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Nor moping maid, that I must still be teaching</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The freedoms of a wife all her life after:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But one, that, having worn the chain before,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (And worn it lightly, as report gave out,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Enfranchised from it by her poor fool's death,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Took it not so to heart that I need dread</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To die myself, for fear a second time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To wet a widow's eye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Some widows, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Hearing you talk so wildly, would be apt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To put strange misconstruction on your words,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As aiming at a Turkish liberty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where the free husband hath his several mates,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      His Penseroso, his Allegro wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To suit his sober, or his frolic fit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How judge you of that latitude?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In European customs bred, must judge. Had I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Been born a native of the liberal East,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I might have thought as they do. Yet I knew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A married man that took a second wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And (the man's circumstances duly weigh'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With all their bearings) the considerate world</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Nor much approved, nor much condemn'd the deed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You move my wonder strangely. Pray, proceed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      An eye of wanton liking he had placed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Upon a Widow, who liked him again,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But stood on terms of honourable love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And scrupled wronging his most virtuous wife—-</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When to their ears a lucky rumour ran,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That this demure and saintly-seeming wife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Had a first husband living; with the which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Being question'd, she but faintly could deny.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      "A priest indeed there was; some words had passed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But scarce amounting to a marriage rite.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Her friend was absent; she supposed him dead;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And, seven years parted, both were free to chuse."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What did the indignant husband? Did he not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With violent handlings stigmatize the cheek</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of the deceiving wife, who had entail'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Shame on their innocent babe?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He neither tore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      His wife's locks nor his own; but wisely weighing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      His own offence with her's in equal poise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And woman's weakness 'gainst the strength of man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Came to a calm and witty compromise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He coolly took his gay-faced widow home,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Made her his second wife; and still the first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Lost few or none of her prerogatives.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The servants call'd her mistress still; she kept</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The keys, and had the total ordering</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of the house affairs; and, some slight toys excepted,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Was all a moderate wife would wish to be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A tale full of dramatic incident!—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And if a man should put it in a play,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How should he name the parties?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The man's name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Through time I have forgot—the widow's too;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But his first wife's first name, her maiden one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Was—not unlike to that your Katherine bore,</p>

<p>

      Before she took the honour'd style of Selby.</p>

      Sir, your pardon—</p>

      Some half hour hence, in the garden's secret walk,</p>

      We shall have leisure. [<emphasis>Exit.</emphasis>]</p>

      Sister, whence come you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      From your poor Katherine's chamber, where she droops</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In sad presageful thoughts, and sighs, and weeps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And seems to pray by turns. At times she looks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As she would pour her secret in my bosom—-</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Then starts, as I have seen her, at the mention</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of some immodest act. At her request</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I left her on her knees.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The fittest posture;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For great has been her fault to Heaven and me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She married me, with a first husband living,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or not known not to be so, which, in the judgment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of any but indifferent honesty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Must be esteem'd the same. The shallow Widow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Caught by my art, under a riddling veil</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Too thin to hide her meaning, hath confess'd all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your coming in broke off the conference,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When she was ripe to tell the fatal <emphasis>name</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That seals my wedded doom.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Was she so forward</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To pour her hateful meanings in your ear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      At the first hint?</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Her newly flatter'd hopes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Array'd themselves at first in forms of doubt;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And with a female caution she stood off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Awhile, to read the meaning of my suit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which with such honest seeming I enforced,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That her cold scruples soon gave way; and now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She rests prepared, as mistress, or as wife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To seize the place of her betrayed friend—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My much offending, but more suffering, Katherine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Into what labyrinth of fearful shapes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My simple project has conducted you—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Were but my wit as skilful to invent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A clue to lead you forth!—I call to mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A letter, which your wife received from the Cape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Soon after you were married, with some circumstances</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of mystery too.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              I well remember it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That letter did confirm the truth (she said)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of a friend's death, which she had long fear'd true,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But knew not for a fact. A youth of promise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She gave him out—a hot adventurous spirit—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That had set sail in quest of golden dreams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And cities in the heart of Central Afric;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But named no names, nor did I care to press</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My question further, in the passionate grief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      She shew'd at the receipt. Might this be he?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Tears were not all. When that first shower was past,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      With clasped hands she raised her eyes to Heav'n,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As if in thankfulness for some escape,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or strange deliverance, in the news implied,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which sweeten'd that sad news.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Something of that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I noted also—</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In her closet once,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Seeking some other trifle, I espied</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A ring, in mournful characters deciphering</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The death of "Robert Halford, aged two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And twenty." Brother, I am not given</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To the confident use of wagers, which I hold</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Unseemly in a woman's argument;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But I am strangely tempted now to risk</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A thousand pounds out of my patrimony,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (And let my future husband look to it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      If it be lost,) that this immodest Widow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Shall name the name that tallies with that ring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That wager lost, I should be rich indeed—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Rich in my rescued Kate—rich in my honour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which now was bankrupt. Sister, I accept</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your merry wager, with an aching heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For very fear of winning. 'Tis the hour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That I should meet my Widow in the walk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The south side of the garden. On some pretence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Lure forth my Wife that way, that she may witness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Our seeming courtship. Keep us still in sight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Yourselves unseen; and by some sign I'll give,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (A finger held up, or a kerchief waved,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You'll know your wager won—then break upon us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As if by chance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      LUCY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I apprehend your meaning—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And may you prove a true Cassandra here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Though my poor acres smart for't, wagering sister.</p>

<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>

<p>

      Did I express myself in terms so strong?</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As nothing could have more affrighted me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Think it a hurt friend's jest, in retribution</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of a suspected cooling hospitality.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And, for my staying here, or going hence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (Now I remember something of our argument,)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Selby and I can settle that between us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You look amazed. What if your husband, child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Himself has courted me to stay?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You move</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My wonder and my pleasure equally.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Yes, courted me to stay, waiv'd all objections.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Made it a favour to yourselves; not me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      His troublesome guest, as you surmised. Child, child!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When I recall his flattering welcome, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Begin to think the burden of my presence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Was—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What, for Heaven—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A little, little spice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of jealousy—that's all—an honest pretext,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      No wife need blush for. Say that you should see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (As oftentimes we widows take such freedoms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Yet still on this side virtue,) in a jest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your husband pat me on the cheek, or steal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A kiss, while you were by,—not else, for virtue's sake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I could endure all this, thinking my husband</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Meant it in sport—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But if in downright earnest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (Putting myself out of the question here)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Your Selby, as I partly do suspect,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Own'd a divided heart—</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My own would break—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Why, what a blind and witless fool it is,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That will not see its gains, its infinite gains—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Gain in a loss,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or mirth in utter desolation!</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>

      He doting on a face—suppose it mine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or any other's tolerably fair—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What need you care about a senseless secret?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Perplex'd and fearful woman! I in part</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Fathom your dangerous meaning. You have broke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The worse than iron band, fretting the soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      By which you held me captive. Whether my husband</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      <emphasis>Is</emphasis> what you gave him out, or your fool'd fancy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But dreams he is so, either way I am free.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      It talks it bravely, blazons out its shame;</p>

<p>      KATHERINE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not to thy wretched self these tears are falling;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But to my husband, and offended heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Some drops are due—and then I sleep in peace,</p>

      I am not so ill a guesser, Mrs. Frampton,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not to conjecture, that some passages</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In your unfinished story, rightly interpreted,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Glanced at my bosom's peace;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      You knew my wife?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Even from her earliest school-days.—What of that?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or how is she concerned in my fine riddles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Framed for the hour's amusement?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      By my <emphasis>hopes</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of my new interest conceived in you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And by the honest passion of my heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which not obliquely I to you did hint;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Come from the clouds of misty allegory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And in plain language let me hear the worst.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Stand I disgraced or no?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Then, by <emphasis>my</emphasis> hopes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of my new interest conceiv'd in you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And by the kindling passion in <emphasis>my</emphasis> breast,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which through my riddles you had almost read,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Adjured so strongly, I will tell you all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In her school years, then bordering on fifteen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or haply not much past, she loved a youth—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      My most ingenuous Widow—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Met him oft</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      By stealth, where I still of the party was—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      SELBY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Prime confidant to all the school, I warrant,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And general go-between—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      [<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>      MRS. FRAMPTON</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      One morn he came</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In breathless haste. "The ship was under sail,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Or in few hours would be, that must convey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Him and his destinies to barbarous shores,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where, should he perish by inglorious hands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      It would be consolation in his death</p>

<p>

      To have call'd his Katherine <emphasis>his</emphasis>."</p>

<empty-line/>

      And my dissuasions not o'er hotly urged,</p>

      Yet cold upon her finger, when they parted—</p>

      He to his ship; and we to school got back,</p>

<p><strong>NOTES</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 1. DEDICATION TO S.T. COLERIDGE, ESQ.</p>
<p>In 1818, when Lamb wrote these words, he was forty-three and Coleridge
forty-six. The <emphasis>Works</emphasis>, in the first volume of which this dedication
appeared, were divided into two volumes, the second, containing prose,
being dedicated to Martin Burney, in the sonnet which I have placed on
page 45. The publishers of the <emphasis>Works</emphasis> were Charles and James Ollier,
who, starting business about 1816, had already published for Leigh Hunt,
Keats, and Shelley.</p>
<p>For the allusion to the threefold cord, in the second paragraph, see the
note on page 313.</p>
<p>The ****** Inn was the Salutation and Cat, in Newgate
Street, since rebuilt, where Coleridge used to stay on his London
visits when he was at Cambridge, and where the landlord is said
to have asked him to continue as a free guest—if only he would
talk and talk. Writing to Coleridge in 1796 Lamb recalls "the
little smoky room at the Salutation and Cat, where we have sat
together through the winter nights, beguiling the cares of life with
Poesy;" and again, "I have been drinking egg-hot and smoking
Oronooko (associated circumstances, which ever forcibly recall to
my mind our evenings and nights at the Salutation)." Later he
added to these concomitants of a Salutation evening, "Egg-hot,
Welsh-rabbit, and metaphysics," and gave as his highest idea of
heaven, listening to Coleridge "repeating one of Bowles's sweetest
sonnets, in your sweet manner, while we two were indulging
sympathy, a solitary luxury, by the fire side at the Salutation."</p>
<p>The line—</p>
<p>      Of summer days and of delightful years</p>
<p>is from Bowles—"Sonnet written at Ostend."</p>

<p>Page 3. Lamb's Earliest Poem. <emphasis>Mille Vice Mortis.</emphasis></p>
<p>In a MS. book that had belonged to James Boyer of Christ's Hospital, in
which his best scholars inscribed compositions, are these lines signed
Charles Lamb, 1789. All Lamb's Grecians are there too. The book was
described by the late Dykes Campbell, Lamb's most accomplished and
enthusiastic student, in the <emphasis>Illustrated London News</emphasis>, December 26,
1891.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>Page 4. POEMS IN COLERIDGE'S <emphasis>POEMS ON VARIOUS SUBJECTS</emphasis>, 1796.</p>
<p>This book was published by Cottle, of Bristol, in 1796. Lamb contributed
four poems, which were thus referred to by Coleridge in the Preface:
"The Effusions signed C.L. were written by Mr. CHARLES LAMB, of the
India House—independently of the signature their superior merit would
have sufficiently distinguished them." Lamb reprinted the first only
once, in 1797, in the second edition of Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, the
remaining three again in his <emphasis>Works</emphasis> in 1818. I have followed in the
body of this volume the text of these later appearances, the original
form of the sonnets being relegated to the notes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 4. <emphasis>As when a child on some long winter's night.</emphasis></p>
<p>Some mystery attaches to the authorship of this sonnet. On December 1,
1794, Coleridge wrote to the editor of the <emphasis>Morning Chronicle</emphasis> saying
that he proposed to send a series of sonnets ("as it is the fashion to
call them") addressed to eminent contemporaries; and he enclosed one to
Mr. Erskine. The editor, with almost Chinese politeness, inserted
beneath the sonnet this note: "Our elegant Correspondent will highly
gratify every reader of taste by the continuance of his exquisitely
beautiful productions." The series continued with Burke, Priestley,
Lafayette, Kosciusko, Chatham, Bowles, and, on December 29, 1794, Mrs.
Siddons—the sonnet here printed—all signed S.T.C.</p>
<p>But the next appearance of the sonnet was as an effusion by Lamb in
Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems on Various Subjects</emphasis>, 1796, signed C.L.; and its next
in the <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, 1797, among Lamb's contributions. In 1803, however, we
find it in Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, third edition, with no reference to Lamb
whatever. This probably means that Lamb and Coleridge had written it
together, that Coleridge's original share had been the greater, and that
Lamb and he had come to an arrangement by which Coleridge was to be
considered the sole author; for Lamb did not reprint it in 1818 with his
other early verse. Writing in 1796 to Coleridge concerning his treatment
of other of Lamb's sonnets, Lamb says: "That to Mrs. Siddons, now, you
were welcome to improve, if it had been worth it; but I say unto you
again, Coleridge, spare my ewe lambs." Such a distinction drawn between
the sonnet to Mrs. Siddons and the others supports the belief that Lamb
had not for it a deeply parental feeling.</p>
<p>This was not the only occasion on which Lamb and Coleridge wrote a
sonnet in partnership. Writing to Southey in December, 1794, Coleridge
says: "Of the following sonnet, the four <emphasis>last</emphasis> lines were written by
Lamb, a man of uncommon genius…."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                        SONNET</strong></p>
<p>      O gentle look, that didst my soul beguile,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Why hast thou left me? Still in some fond dream</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Revisit my sad heart, auspicious smile!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As falls on closing flowers the lunar beam;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      What time in sickly mood, at parting day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I lay me down and think of happier years;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of joys, that glimmered in Hope's twilight ray,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Then left me darkling in a vale of tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      O pleasant days of Hope—for ever flown!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Could I recall one!—But that thought is vain,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Availeth not Persuasion's sweetest tone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To lure the fleet-winged travellers back again:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Anon, they haste to everlasting night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Nor can a giant's arm arrest them in their flight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Subsequently Coleridge rewrote the final couplet.</p>
<p>The same letter to Southey informs us that the sonnet to Mrs. Siddons
was not Lamb's earliest poem, although it stands first in his poetical
works; for Coleridge remarks: "Have you seen his [Lamb's] divine sonnet,
'O! I could laugh to hear the winter wind'?" (see page 5).</p>
<p>Lamb printed the sonnet to Mrs. Siddons twice—in 1796 and 1797.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 4. <emphasis>Was it some sweet device of Faery.</emphasis></p>
<p>This sonnet passed through various vicissitudes. Lamb had sent it to
Coleridge for his <emphasis>Poems on Various Subjects</emphasis> in 1796, and Coleridge
proceeded to re-model it more in accordance with his own views. The
following version, representing his modifications, was the one that
found its way into print as Lamb's:—</p>
<p>      Was it some sweet device of faery land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That mock'd my steps with many a lonely glade,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And fancied wand'rings with a fair-hair'd maid?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Have these things been? Or did the wizard wand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of Merlin wave, impregning vacant air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And kindle up the vision of a smile</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In those blue eyes, that seem'd to speak the while</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Such tender things, as might enforce Despair</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To drop the murth'ring knife, and let go by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      His fell resolve? Ah me! the lonely glade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Still courts the footsteps of the fair-hair'd maid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Among whose locks the west-winds love to sigh;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But I forlorn do wander, reckless where,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And mid my wand'rings find no ANNA there!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                                C.L.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>Lamb naturally protested when the result came under his eyes. "I love my
own feelings: they are dear to memory," he says in a letter in 1796,
"though they now and then wake a sigh or a tear. 'Thinking on divers
things foredone,' I charge you, Coleridge, spare my ewe lambs." Later,
when Coleridge's second edition was in preparation, Lamb wrote again
(January 10, 1797): "I need not repeat my wishes to have my little
sonnets printed <emphasis>verbatim</emphasis> my last way. In particular, I fear lest you
should prefer printing my first sonnet [this one] as you have done more
than once, 'Did the wand of Merlin wave?' It looks so like <emphasis>Mr</emphasis>. Merlin,
the ingenious successor of the immortal Merlin, now living in good
health and spirits, and flourishing in magical reputation in Oxford
Street." The phrase "more than once" in the foregoing passage needs
explanation. It refers to the little pamphlet of sonnets, entitled
<emphasis>Sonnets from Various Authors</emphasis>, which Coleridge issued privately in
1796, and of which only one copy is now known to exist—that preserved
in the Dyce and Forster collection at South Kensington. The little
pamphlet contains twenty-eight sonnets in all, of which three are by
Bowles, four by Southey, four by Charles Lloyd, four by Coleridge, four
by Lamb, and others by various writers: all of which were chosen for
their suitability to be bound up with the sonnets of Bowles. Lamb's
sonnets were: "We were two pretty babes" (see page 9), "Was it some
sweet device" (printed with Coleridge's alterations), "When last I
roved" (see page 8), and "O! I could laugh" (see page 5).</p>
<p>The present sonnet belongs to the series of four love sonnets which is
completed by the one that follows, "Methinks, how dainty sweet it were,"
and those on page 8 beginning, "When last I roved" and "A timid grace."
Anna is believed to have been Ann Simmons, who lived at Blenheims, a
group of cottages near Blakesware, the house where Mrs. Field, Lamb's
grandmother, was housekeeper. Mrs. Field died in 1792, after which time
Lamb's long visits to that part of the country probably ceased. He was
then seventeen. Nothing is known of Lamb's attachment beyond these
sonnets, the fact that when he lost his reason for a short time in
1795-1796 he attributed the cause to some person unmentioned who is
conjectured to have been Anna, and the occasional references in the Ella
essays to "Alice W——" and to his old passion for her (see "Dream
Children" in particular, in Vol. II). The death of Mrs. Lamb in
September, 1796, and the duty of caring for and nursing his sister Mary,
which then devolved upon Charles, put an end to any dreams of private
happiness that he may have been indulging; and his little romance was
over. How deep his passion was we are not likely ever to know; but Lamb
thenceforward made very light of it, except in the pensive recollections
in the essays twenty-five years later. In November, 1796, when sending
Coleridge poems for his second edition, he says: "Do not entitle any of
my <emphasis>things</emphasis> Love Sonnets, as I told you to call 'em; 'twill only make me
look little in my own eyes; for it is a passion of which I retain
nothing…. Thank God, the folly has left me for ever. Not even a review
of my love verses renews one wayward wish in me…." Again, in November,
1796, in another letter to Coleridge, about his poems in the 1797
edition, Lamb says: "Oh, my friend! I think sometimes, could I recall
the days that are past, which among them should I choose? not those
'merrier days,' not the 'pleasant days of hope,' not 'those wanderings
with a fair-hair'd maid,' which I have so often and so feelingly
regretted, but the days, Coleridge, of a <emphasis>mother's</emphasis> fondness for her
<emphasis>school-boy</emphasis>." Lamb printed this sonnet three times—in 1796, 1797 and
1818.</p>

<p>Page 5. <emphasis>Methinks how dainty sweet it were, reclin'd.</emphasis></p>
<p>When this sonnet was printed by Coleridge in 1796 the sestet
was made to run thus:—</p>
<p>      But ah! sweet scenes of fancied bliss, adieu!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      On rose-leaf beds amid your faery bowers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I all too long have lost the dreamy hours!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Beseems it now the sterner Muse to woo,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      If haply she her golden meed impart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To realise the vision of the heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Lamb remonstrated: "I had rather have seen what I wrote myself, though
they bear no comparison with your exquisite lines—</p>
<p>"On rose-leaf'd beds, amid your faery bowers, etc.</p>
<p>I love my sonnets because they are the reflected images of my Own
feelings at different times." This sonnet was printed by Lamb three
times—in 1796, 1797 and 1798.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 5. <emphasis>O! I could laugh to hear the midnight wind,</emphasis></p>
<p>This sonnet, written probably at Margate, was entitled, in 1796,
"Written at Midnight, by the Seaside, after a Voyage." The last
lines then ran:—</p>
<p>      And almost wish'd it were no crime to die!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How Reason reel'd! What gloomy transports rose!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Till the rude dashings rock'd them to repose.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The couplet was Coleridge's, and Lamb protested (June 10, 1796),
describing them as good lines, but adding that they "must spoil
the whole with me who know it is only a fiction of yours and that
the rude dashings did in fact not rock me to repose."</p>
<p>When reprinted in 1797, the final couplet was omitted, asterisks
standing instead. The present sonnet was probably the earliest of Lamb's
printed poems. In the Elia essay "The Old Margate Hoy," Lamb states that
the first time he saw the sea was on a visit to Margate as a boy, by
water—probably the voyage that suggested this sonnet. Lamb printed the
sonnet three times—in 1796, 1797 and 1818.</p>

<p>Page 6. LLOYD'S <emphasis>POEMS ON THE DEATH OF PRISCILLA FARMER</emphasis>, 1796.</p>
<p>Charles Lloyd (1775-1839), the son of Charles Lloyd, of Birmingham (a
cultured and philanthropical Quaker banker), joined Coleridge at Bristol
late in 1796 as his private pupil, and moved with the family to Nether
Stowey. Priscilla Farmer was Lloyd's maternal grandmother, to whom he
was much attached, and on her death he composed the sonnets that form
this costly quarto, published for Lloyd by Coleridge's friend, Joseph
Cottle, of Bristol, in the winter of 1796.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 6. <emphasis>The Grandame.</emphasis></p>
<p>Lamb sent these lines in their first state to Coleridge in June, 1796,
at, which time they were, I conjecture, part of a long blank-verse poem
which he was then meditating, and of which "Childhood," "Fancy Employed
on Divine Subjects," and "The Sabbath Bells" (see pages 9 and 10) were
probably other portions. The poem was never finished. On June 13, 1796,
he writes to Coleridge:—</p>
<p>"Of the blank verses I spoke of, the following lines are the only
tolerably complete ones I have writ out of not more than one hundred and
fifty. That I get on slowly you may fairly impute to want of practice in
composition, when I declare to you that (the few verses which you have
seen excepted) I have not writ fifty lines since I left school. It may
not be amiss to remark that my grandmother (on whom the verses are
written) lived housekeeper in a family the fifty or sixty last years of
her life—that she was a woman of exemplary piety and goodness—and for
many years before her death was terribly afflicted with a cancer in her
breast, which she bore with true Christian patience. You may think that
I have not kept enough apart the ideas of her heavenly and her earthly
master; but recollect I have designedly given into her own way of
feeling; and if she had a failing 'twas that she respected her master's
family too much, not reverenced her Maker too little. The lines begin
imperfectly, as I may probably connect 'em if I finish at all: and if I
do, Biggs shall print 'em (in a more economical way than you yours),
for, Sonnets and all, they won't make a thousand lines as I propose
completing 'em, and the substance must be wire-drawn."</p>
<p>When Charles Lloyd joined Coleridge later in the year, and was preparing
his <emphasis>Poems in Memory of Priscilla Farmer</emphasis>, Coleridge obtained Lamb's
permission for "The Grandame" to be included with them. The lines were
introduced by Lloyd in these words: "The following beautiful fragment
was written by CHARLES LAMB, of the India-House.—Its subject being the
same with that of my Poems, I was solicitous to have it printed with
them: and I am indebted to a Friend of the Author's for the permission."</p>
<p>The poem differed then very slightly from its present form. When the
book was sent to Lamb he remarked (in December, 1796) on "the odd
coincidence of two young men, in one age, carolling their
grandmothers…. I cannot but smile to see my Granny so gayly deck'd
forth [the book was expensively produced by Lloyd], tho', I think,
whoever altered 'thy' praises to 'her' praises—'thy' honoured memory to
'her' honoured memory [lines 27 and 28], did wrong—they best exprest my
feelings. There is a pensive state of recollection, in which the mind is
disposed to apostrophise the departed objects of its attachment; and,
breaking loose from grammatical precision, changes from the 1st to the
3rd, and from the 3rd to the 1st person, just as the random fancy or
feeling directs."</p>
<p>Mrs. Mary Field, <emphasis>née</emphasis> Bruton, Lamb's maternal grandmother, was
housekeeper at Blakesware house, near Widford, the seat of the Plumer
family for very many years, during the latter part of her life being
left in sole charge, for William Plumer had moved to his other seat,
Gilston, a few miles distant (see "Blakesmoor in H—— shire," and
notes, Vol. II). Lamb and his brother and sister visited their
grandmother at Blakesware as though in her own house. Mrs. Field died of
cancer in the breast, July 31, 1792, aged seventy-nine, and was buried
in Widford churchyard.</p>
<p>Approached from the east the churchyard seems to be anything but on the
hilltop, for one descends to it; but it stands on a ridge, and seen from
the north, or, as at the old Blakesware house, from the west, it appears
to crown an eminence. The present spire, though slender and tapering, is
not that which Lamb used to see. Mrs. Field's plain stone, whose
legibility was not long since threatened by overhanging branches, has
now been saved from danger and may still be read. It merely records the
name "Mary Feild" (a mistake of the stone-cutter) and the bare dates.</p>
<p>This poem was printed by Lamb three times—in 1796 (in Lloyd's book), in
1797 (with Coleridge) and in 1818.</p>

<p>Page 8. COLERIDGE'S <emphasis>POEMS</emphasis>, 1797.</p>
<p>Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems on Various Subjects</emphasis>, 1796, went into a second
edition in 1797 under the title, <emphasis>Poems by S.T. Coleridge, Second
Edition, to which are now added Poems by Charles Lamb and Charles
Lloyd</emphasis>. Coleridge invented a motto from Groscollius for the title-page,
bearing upon this poetical partnership: "Duplex nobis vinculum, et
amicitiae et similium junctarumque Camoenarum; quod utinam neque mors
solvat, neque temporis longinquitas!" "Double is the bond which binds
us—friendship, and a kindred taste in poetry. Would that neither death
nor lapse of time could dissolve it!"</p>
<p>Lamb's contributions were thus referred to by Coleridge in the Preface:
"There were inserted in my former Edition, a few Sonnets of my Friend
and old School-fellow, CHARLES LAMB. He has now communicated to me a
complete Collection of all his Poems; quae qui non prorsus amet, illum
omnes et Virtutes et Veneres odore." (Which things, whoever is not
unreservedly in love with, is detested by all the Virtues and the
Graces.) Lamb's poems came last in the book, an arrangement insisted
upon in a letter from him to Coleridge in November, 1796:—"Do you
publish with Lloyd, or without him? In either case my little portion may
come last; and after the fashion of orders to a country correspondent, I
will give directions how I should like to have 'em done. The title-page
to stand thus:—</p>

<p>Page 8. <emphasis>When last I roved these winding wood-walks green,</emphasis></p>
<p>This was sent to Coleridge on June 1, 1796, in a letter containing also
the sonnets, "The Lord of Life," page 16; "A timid grace," page 8; and
"We were two pretty babes," page 9. It was written, said Lamb, "on
revisiting a spot, where the scene was laid of my 1st sonnet"—"Was it
some sweet device," page 4. Lamb printed this sonnet twice—in 1797 and
1818.  Page 8. <emphasis>A timid grace sits trembling in her eye.</emphasis></p>
<p>This, the last of the four love sonnets (see note on page 310), seems to
be a survival of a discarded effort, for Lamb tells Coleridge, in the
letter referred to in the preceding note, that it "retains a few lines
from a sonnet of mine, which you once remarked had no 'body of thought'
in it." Lamb printed this sonnet twice—in 1797 and 1818.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 9. <emphasis>If from my lips some angry accents fell,</emphasis></p>
<p>Lamb sent this sonnet, which is addressed to his sister, to Coleridge in
May, 1796. "The Sonnet I send you has small merit as poetry, but you
will be curious to read it when I tell you it was written in my
prison-house [an asylum] in one of my lucid Intervals." It is dated 1795
in Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>. Lamb printed the sonnet twice—in 1797 and 1818.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 9. <emphasis>We were two pretty babes, the youngest she.</emphasis></p>
<p>First printed in the <emphasis>Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, July, 1796. "The next and last
[wrote Lamb in the letter to Coleridge referred to in the notes on page
310] I value most of all. 'Twas composed close upon the heels of the
last ['A timid grace,' page 8], in that very wood I had in mind when I
wrote 'Methinks how dainty sweet' [page 5]." It is dated 1795 in
Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>. In the same letter Lamb adds:—"Since writing it, I
have found in a poem by Hamilton of Bangour [William Hamilton,
1704-1754, the Scotch poet, of Bangour, Linlithgowshire] these 2 lines
to happiness:—</p>
<p>      "Nun sober and devout, where art thou fled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To hide in shades thy meek contented head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Lines eminently beautiful, but I do not remember having re'd 'em
previously, for the credit of my 10th and 11th lines. Parnell [Thomas
Parnell, 1679-1718] has 2 lines (which probably suggested the <emphasis>above</emphasis>)
to Contentment</p>
<p>      "Whither ah whither art Thou fled,</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>      "Was there a tree [about] that did not know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The love betwixt us two?—"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>When Coleridge printed the sonnet in the pamphlet described on page 310,
he appended to the eleventh line the following note:—</p>
<p>Innocence, which, while we possess it, is playful as a babe, becomes
AWFUL when it has departed from us. This is the sentiment of the line
—a fine sentiment and nobly expressed.</p>

<p>See note to "The Grandame," page 312. The "turf-clad slope" in line 4
was probably at Blakesware. It is difficult to re-create the scene, for
the new house stands a quarter of a mile west of the old one, the site
of which is hidden by grass and trees. Where once were gardens is now
meadow land.</p>

<p>Lamb printed this poem twice—in 1797 and 1818. Church bells seem always

<p>In the letter of December 5, 1796, quoted below, Lamb remarks concerning
this poem: "I beg you to alter the words 'pain and want,' to 'pain and
grief' (line 10), this last being a more familiar and ear-satisfying
combination. Do it, I beg of you." But the alteration either was not
made, or was cancelled later. The reference in lines 6, 7 and 8 is to
Revelation xxii. 1, 2. See note to "The Grandame." Lamb printed this
poem twice—in 1797 and 1818.</p>

<p>Page 11. <emphasis>The Tomb of Douglas.</emphasis></p>
<p>The play on which this poem was founded was the tragedy of "Douglas" by
John Home (1722-1808), produced in 1756. Young Norval, or Douglas, the
hero, after killing the false Glenalvon, is slain by his stepfather,
Lord Randolph, unknowing who he is. On hearing of Norval's death his
mother, Lady Randolph, throws herself from a precipice. In the letter to
Coleridge of December 5, 1796, quoted above, Lamb also copied out "The
Tomb of Douglas," prefixing these remarks:—"I would also wish to retain
the following if only to perpetuate the memory of so exquisite a
pleasure as I have often received at the performance of the tragedy of
Douglas, when Mrs. Siddons has been the Lady Randolph…. To understand
the following, if you are not acquainted with the play, you should know
that on the death of Douglas his mother threw herself down a rock; and
that at that time Scotland was busy in repelling the Danes."</p>
<p>Coleridge told Southey that Lamb during his derangement at the end of
1795 and beginning of 1796 believed himself at one time to be Young
Norval.</p>
<p>Lamb printed this poem, which differs curiously in character from all
his other poetical works, only once—in 1797.</p>

<p>Page 12. <emphasis>To Charles Lloyd.</emphasis></p>
<p>Lamb copied these lines in a letter to Coleridge on January 18, 1797,
remarking:—"You have learned by this time, with surprise, no doubt,
that Lloyd is with me in town. The emotions I felt on his coming so
unlooked for are not ill expressed in what follows, and what if you do
not object to them as too personal, and to the world obscure, or
otherwise wanting in worth I should wish to make a part of our little
volume."</p>
<p>It must be remembered, in reading the poem, that Lamb was still in the
shadow of the tragedy in which he lost his mother, and, for a while, his
sister, and which had ruined his home. For other lines to Charles Lloyd
see page 21. This poem was printed by Lamb twice—in 1797 and 1818.</p>

<p>Writing to Coleridge on June 13, 1797, Lamb says of this Spenserian
exercise:—"You speak slightingly. Surely the longer stanzas were pretty
tolerable; at least there was one good line in it [line 5]:</p>
<p>"Thick-shaded trees, with dark green leaf rich clad.</p>
<p>To adopt your own expression, I call this a 'rich' line, a fine full
line. And some others I thought even beautiful." Lamb printed the poem

<p>Page 16. <emphasis>Sonnet: The Lord of Life shakes off his drowsihed</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, December, 1797. Signed Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>Lamb sent the first draft of this sonnet to Coleridge in 1796, saying
that it was composed "during a walk down into Hertfordshire early in
last Summer." "The last line," he adds, "is a copy of Bowles's 'to the
green hamlet in the peaceful plain.' Your ears are not so very
fastidious—many people would not like words so prosaic and familiar in
a sonnet as Islington and Hertfordshire." We must take Lamb's word for
it; but the late W.J. Craig found for the last line a nearer parallel
than Bowles'. In William Vallans' "Tale of the Two Swannes" (1590),
which is quoted in Leland's Itinerary, Hearne's edition, is the phrase:
"The fruitful fields of pleasant Hertfordshire." Lamb quotes his own
line in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "My Relations."</p>
<p>This sonnet is perhaps the only occasion on which Lamb, even in play,
wrote anything against his beloved city.</p>
<p>It may be noted here that this was Lamb's last contribution to the
<emphasis>Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, which had printed in the preceding number, November,
1797, Coleridge's satirical sonnets, signed Nehemiah Higginbottom, in
which Lamb and Lloyd were ridiculed, and which had perhaps some bearing
on the coolness that for a while was to subsist between Coleridge and
Lamb (see <emphasis>Charles Lamb and the Lloyds</emphasis>, 1898, pages 44-47).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 16. <emphasis>To the Poet Cowper</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, December, 1796. Signed C. Lamb.</p>
<p>Lamb wrote these lines certainly as early as July, 1796, for he sends
them to Coleridge on the 6th of that month, adding:—</p>
<p>"I fear you will not accord entirely with my sentiments of Cowper, as
<emphasis>exprest</emphasis> above, (perhaps scarcely just), but the poor Gentleman has
just recovered from his Lunacies, and that begets pity, and pity love,
and love admiration, and then it goes hard with People but they lie!"</p>
<p>Lamb admired Cowper greatly in those days—particularly his "Crazy Kate"
("Task," Book I., 534-556). "I have been reading 'The Task' with fresh
delight," he says on December 5, 1796. "I am glad you love Cowper. I
could forgive a man for not enjoying Milton, but I would not call that
man my friend, who should be offended with the 'divine chit-chat of
Cowper.'" And again a little later, "I do so love him."</p>

<p><emphasis>The Monthly Magazine,</emphasis> January, 1797. Signed Charles Lamb.</p>
<p>Lamb sent the lines in their original state to Coleridge in the letter
of July 5, 1796, immediately before the words "<emphasis>Let us prose,</emphasis>" at the
head of that document as it is now preserved.</p>
<p>"Another minstrel" was Coleridge. Chatterton was the mysterious youth of
line 16. Thomas Chatterton (1752-1770) was baptised at St. Mary
Redcliffe, Bristol; he was the nephew of the sexton; he brooded for many
hours a day in the church; he copied his antique writing from the
parchment in its muniment room; one of his later dreams was to be able
to build a new spire; and a cenotaph to his memory was erected by public
subscription in 1840 near the north-east angle of the churchyard.
Chatterton went to London on April 24, 1770, aged seventeen and a half,
and died there by his own hand on August 25 of the same year.</p>
<p>The poem originated in an invitation to Lamb from the Coleridges at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bristol, which he hoped to be able to accept; but to his request for the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

necessary holiday from the India House came refusal. Lamb went to Nether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stowey, however, in the following summer and met Wordsworth there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Lamb at one time wished these lines to be included among his poems in
the second edition of Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, 1797. Writing on January 18,
1797, Lamb says: "I shall be sorry if that volume comes out, as it
necessarily must do, unless you print those very school boyish verses I
sent you on not getting leave to come down to Bristol last summer." At
the end of the letter he adds: "Yet I should feel ashamed that to you I
wrote nothing better. But they are too personal, almost trifling and
obscure withal."</p>

<p>Lamb sent this sonnet to Coleridge on January 2, 1797, remarking: "If
the fraternal sentiment conveyed in the following lines will atone for
the total want of any thing like merit or genius in it, I desire you
will print it next after my other Sonnet to my Sister." The other sonnet
was, "If from my lips some peevish accents fall," printed with
Coleridge's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis> in 1797 (see page 9), concerning which book Lamb was
writing in the above letter. Coleridge apparently decided against the
present sonnet, for it was not printed in that book.</p>
<p>Writing to Coleridge again a week later concerning the present poem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lamb said:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"I am aware of the unpoetical caste of the 6 last lines of my last
sonnet, and think myself unwarranted in smuggling so tame a thing into
the book; only the sentiments of those 6 lines are thoroughly congenial
to me in my state of mind, and I wish to accumulate perpetuating tokens
of my affection to poor Mary."</p>
<p>It has to be borne in mind that only three months had elapsed since the
death of Mrs. Lamb, and Mary was still in confinement.</p>

<p>The <emphasis>Annual Anthology,</emphasis> Vol. I., 1799.</p>
<p>Vol. I. of the <emphasis>Annual Anthology</emphasis>, edited by Southey for Joseph Cottle,
was issued in September, 1799; and that was, I believe, this poem's
first appearance as a whole. Early in 1799, however, Charles Lloyd had
issued a pamphlet entitled <emphasis>Lines suggested by the Fast appointed on
Wednesday, February 27, 1799</emphasis> (Birmingham, 1799), in which, in a note,
he quotes a passage from Lamb's poem, beginning, "some braver spirits"
(line 23), and ending, "prey on carcasses" (line 36), with the prefatory
remark: "I am happy in the opportunity afforded me of introducing the
following striking extract from some lines, intended as a satire on the
Godwinian jargon."</p>
<p>Writing to Southey concerning this poem, Lamb says:-"I can have no
objection to you printing 'Mystery of God' [afterwards called 'Living
without God in the World'] with my name, and all due acknowledgments for
the honour and favour of the communication: indeed, 'tis a poem that can
dishonour no name. Now, that is in the true strain of modern modesto
vanitas."</p>

<p>Page 21. <emphasis>BLANK VERSE</emphasis>, BY CHARLES LLOYD AND CHARLES LAMB, 1798.</p>
<p>Charles Lloyd left Coleridge early in 1797, and was in the winter
1797-1798 living in London, sharing lodgings with James White (Lamb's
friend and the author of <emphasis>Original Letters, etc., of Sir John Falstaff</emphasis>,
1796). It was then that the joint production of this volume was entered
upon. Of the seven poems contributed by Lamb only "The Old Familiar
Faces" (shorn of one stanza) and the lines "Composed at Midnight" were
reprinted by him: on account, it may be assumed, of his wish not to
revive in his sister, who would naturally read all that he published,
any painful recollections. Not that she refused in after years to speak
of her mother, but Lamb was, I think, sensitive for her and for himself
and the family too. As a matter of fact the circumstances of Mrs. Lamb's
death were known only to a very few of the Lambs' friends until after
Charles' death. It must be remembered that when <emphasis>Blank Verse</emphasis> was
originally published, in 1798, Mary Lamb was still living apart, nor was
it known that she, would ever be herself again.</p>
<p>It was this little volume which gave Gillray an opportunity for
introducing Lamb and Lloyd into his cartoon "The New Morality,"
published in the first number of <emphasis>The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine</emphasis>
(which succeeded Canning's <emphasis>Anti-Jacobin</emphasis>), August 1, 1798. Canning's
lines, "The New Morality," had been published in <emphasis>The Anti-Jacobin</emphasis> on
July 9, 1798, containing the couplets:—</p>
<p>      And ye five other wandering Bards that move</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In sweet accord of harmony and love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<p>In the picture Gillray introduced "Coleridge" as a donkey offering a
volume of "Dactylics," and Southey as another donkey, flourishing a
volume of "Saphics." Behind them, seated side by side, poring over a
manuscript entitled "Blank Verse, by Toad and Frog," are a toad and frog
which the Key states to be Lloyd and Lamb. It was in reference to this
picture that Godwin, on first meeting Lamb, asked him, "Pray, Mr. Lamb,
are you toad or frog?"</p>

<p><emphasis>The Monthly Magazine</emphasis>, October, 1797. Signed.</p>
<p>Lamb sent these lines to Coleridge in September, 1797, remarking: "The
following I wrote when I had returned from Charles Lloyd, leaving him
behind at Burton, with Southey. To understand some of it you must
remember that at that time he was very much perplexed in mind." Lloyd
throughout his life was given to religious speculations which now and
then disturbed his mind to an alarming extent, affecting him not unlike
the gloomy forebodings and fears that beset Cowper. On this particular
occasion he was in difficulty also as to his engagement with Sophia
Pemberton, with whom he was meditating elopement and a Scotch marriage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 21. <emphasis>Written on the Day of my Aunt's Funeral.</emphasis></p>
<p>"This afternoon," Lamb wrote to Coleridge on February 13, 1797, "I
attend the funeral of my poor old aunt, who died on Thursday. I own I am
thankful that the good creature has ended all her days of suffering and
infirmity. She was to me the 'cherisher of infancy.' …" Lamb's Aunt
Hetty was his father's sister. Her real name was Sarah Lamb. All that we
know of her is found in this poem, in the <emphasis>Letters</emphasis>, in the passages in
"Christ's Hospital Five and Thirty Years Ago," and "My Relations;" in
the story of "The Witch Aunt," in <emphasis>Mrs. Leicester's School</emphasis>, and in a
reference in one of Mary Lamb's letters to Sarah Stoddart, where,
writing of her aunt and her mother,—"the best creatures in the
world,"—she speaks of Miss Lamb as being "as unlike a gentlewoman as
you can possibly imagine a good old woman to be;" contrasting her with
Mrs. Lamb, "a perfect gentlewoman." The description in "The Witch Aunt"
bears out Mary Lamb's letter.</p>
<p>After the tragedy of September, 1796, Aunt Hetty was taken into the
house of a rich relative. This lady, however, seems to have been of too
selfish and jealous a disposition (see Lamb's letter to Coleridge,
December 9, 1796) to exert any real effort to make her guest comfortable
or happy. Hence Aunt Hetty returned to her nephew.</p>
<p>"My poor old aunt [Lamb wrote to Coleridge on January 5, 1797], whom you
have seen, the kindest, goodest creature to me when I was at school; who
used to toddle there to bring me fag [food], when I, school-boy like,
only despised her for it, and used to be ashamed to see her come and sit
herself down on the old coal-hole steps as you went into the old
grammar-school, opend her apron, and bring out her bason with some nice
thing she had caused to be saved for me—the good old creature is now
lying on her death bed…. She says, poor thing, she is glad to come
home to die with me. I was always her favourite."</p>
<p>Line 24. <emphasis>One parent yet is left</emphasis>. John Lamb, who is described as he was
in his prime, as Lovel, in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on <emphasis>"The Old Benchers of the
Inner Temple,"</emphasis> died in 1799.</p>
<p>Line 27. <emphasis>A semblance most forlorn of what he was</emphasis>. Lamb uses this line
as a quotation, slightly altered, in his account of Lovel.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>Page 22. <emphasis>Written a Year after the Events</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Lamb sent this poem to Coleridge in September, 1797, entitling it
"Written a Twelvemonth after the Events," and adding, "Friday next,
Coleridge, is the day on which my Mother died." Mrs. Lamb's death, at
the hands of her daughter in a moment of frenzy, occurred on September
22, 1796. Lamb added that he wrote the poem at the office with "unusual
celerity." "I expect you to like it better than anything of mine; Lloyd
does, and I do myself." The version sent to Coleridge differs only in
minor and unimportant points from that in <emphasis>Blank Verse</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of the poem is very similar to a passage which Lamb
had written in a letter to Coleridge on November 14, 1796:—</p>
<p>"Oh, my friend! I think sometimes, could I recall the days that are
past, which among them should I choose? not those 'merrier days,' not
the 'pleasant days of hope,' not 'those wanderings with a fair-hair'd
maid,' which I have so often and so feelingly regretted, but the days,
Coleridge, of a <emphasis>mother's</emphasis> fondness for her <emphasis>school-boy</emphasis>. What would I
give to call her back to earth for <emphasis>one</emphasis> day!—on my knees to ask her
pardon for all those little asperities of temper which, from time to
time, have given her gentle spirit pain!—and the day, my friend, I
trust, will come. There will be 'time enough' for kind offices of love,
if 'Heaven's eternal year' be ours. Here-after, her meek spirit shall
not reproach me."</p>
<p>In the last paragraph of the poem is a hint of "The Old Familiar Faces,"
that was to follow it in the course of a few months.</p>
<p>Lines 52, 53. <emphasis>And one, above the rest</emphasis>. Probably Coleridge is meant.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 24. <emphasis>Written soon after the Preceding Poem</emphasis>.</p>
<p>The poem is addressed to Lamb's mother. Lamb seems to have sent a copy
to Southey, although the letter containing it has not been perserved,
for we find Southey passing it on to his friend C.W.W. Wynn on November
29, 1797, with a commendation: "I know that our tastes differ much in
poetry, and yet I think you must like these lines by Charles Lamb."</p>
<p>The following passage in Rosamund Gray, which Lamb was writing at this
time, is curiously like these poems in tone. It occurs in one of the
letters from Elinor Clare to her friend—letters in which Lamb seems to
describe sometimes his own feelings, and sometimes those of his sister,
on their great sorrow:—</p>
<p>"Maria! shall not the meeting of blessed spirits, think you, be
something like this?—I think, I could even now behold my mother without
dread—I would ask pardon of her for all my past omissions of duty, for
all the little asperities in my temper, which have so often grieved her
gentle spirit when living. Maria! I think she would not turn away from
me.</p>
<p>"Oftentimes a feeling, more vivid than memory, brings her before me—I
see her sit in her old elbow chair—her arms folded upon her lap—a tear
upon her cheek, that seems to upbraid her unkind daughter for some
inattention—I wipe it away and kiss her honored lips.</p>
<p>"Maria! when I have been fancying all this, Allan will come in, with his
poor eyes red with weeping, and taking me by the hand, destroy the
vision in a moment.</p>
<p>"I am prating to you, my sweet cousin, but it is the prattle of the
heart, which Maria loves. Besides, whom have I to talk to of these
things but you—you have been my counsellor in times past, my companion,
and sweet familiar friend. Bear with me a little—I mourn the
'cherishers of my infancy.'"</p>

<p>Mary Lamb, to whom these lines were addressed, after seeming to be on
the road to perfect recovery, had suddenly had a relapse necessitating a
return to confinement from the lodging in which her brother had placed
her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 25. <emphasis>The Old Familiar Faces</emphasis>.</p>
<p>This, the best known of all Lamb's poems, was written in January, 1798,
following, it is suggested, upon a fit of resentment against Charles
Lloyd. Writing to Coleridge in that month Lamb tells of that little
difference, adding, "but he has forgiven me." Mr. J.A. Rutter, who,
through Canon Ainger, enunciated this theory, thinks that Lloyd may be
the "friend" of the fourth stanza, and Coleridge the "friend" of the
sixth. The old—but untenable—supposition was that it was Coleridge
whom Lamb had left abruptly. On the other hand it might possibly have
been James White, especially as he was of a resolutely high-spirited
disposition.</p>
<p>In its 1798 form the poem began with this stanza:—</p>
<p>      Where are they gone, the old familiar faces?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I had a mother, but she died, and left me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Died prematurely in a day of horrors—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      All, all are gone, the old familiar faces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And the last stanza began with the word "For," and italicised the words</p>
<p><emphasis>And some are taken from me</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I am inclined to think from this italicisation that it was Mary Lamb's
new seizure that was the real impulse of the poem.</p>
<p>The poem was dated January, 1798. Lamb printed it twice—in 1798 and
1818.</p>

declaiming against the crimes of the poor and uneducated, and in favour
of the torments of prisons and prison-ships in this world, and worse in
the next. Such a one, says the poet,</p>

       Lolling, &amp;c.'"</p>

<p>The volume containing <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>, 1802, which is placed in the
present edition among Lamb's plays, on page 149, included also the
"Fragments of Burton" (see Vol. I.) and two lyrics.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 28. <emphasis>Helen</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Lamb sent this poem to Coleridge on August 26, 1800, remarking:—"How do
you like this little epigram? It is not my writing, nor had I any finger
in it. If you concur with me in thinking it very elegant and very
original, I shall be tempted to name the author to you. I will just hint
that it is almost or quite a first attempt."</p>
<p>The author was, of course, Mary Lamb. In his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "Blakesmoor in
H——shire" in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, September, 1824, Lamb quoted the
poem, stating that "Bridget took the hint" of her "pretty whimsical
lines" from a portrait of one of the Plumers' ancestors. The portrait
was the cool pastoral beauty with a lamb, and it was partly to make fun
of her brother's passion for the picture that Mary wrote the lines.</p>

<p>This poem was written for Coleridge's translation of "The Piccolimini,"
the first part of Schiller's "Wallenstein," in 1800—Coleridge supplying
a prose paraphrase (for Lamb knew no German) for the purpose. The
original is Thekla's song in Act II., Scene 6:—</p>
<p>      Der Eichwald brauset, die Wolken ziehn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Das Mägdlein wandelt an Ufers Grün,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Es bricht sich die Welle mit Macht, mit Macht,</p>

<p>

      Und sie singt hinaus in die finstre Nacht,</p>

<p>

      Ich habe genossen das irdische Glück,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ich habe gelebt und geliebet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Coleridge's own translation of Thekla's song, which was printed alone in
later editions of the play, ran thus:—</p>
<p>      The cloud doth gather, the greenwood roar,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The damsel paces along the shore;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The billows they tumble with might, with might;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And she flings out her voice to the darksome night;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Her bosom is swelling with sorrow;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The world it is empty, the heart will die,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      There's nothing to wish for beneath the sky:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Thou Holy One, call thy child away!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I've lived and loved, and that was to-day—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Make ready my grave-clothes to-morrow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Barry Cornwall, in his memoir of Lamb, says: "Lamb used to boast that he
supplied one line to his friend in the fourth scene [Act IV., Scene i]
of that tragedy, where the description of the Pagan deities occurs. In
speaking of Saturn, he is figured as 'an old man melancholy.' 'That was
my line,' Lamb would say, exultingly." The line did not reach print in
this form.</p>

<p>These two poems formed, in the <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis> volume, 1802, portions of
the "Fragments of Burton," which will be found in Vol. I. Lamb
afterwards took out these poems and printed them separately in the
Works, 1818, in the form here given. Originally "Hypochondriacus" formed
Extract III. of the "Fragments," under the title "A Conceipt of
Diabolical Possession." The body of the verses differed very slightly
from the present state; but at the end the prayer ran: "<emphasis>Jesu Mariae!
libera nos ab his tentationibus, oral, implorat, R.B. Peccator</emphasis>"—R.B.
standing for Robert Burton, the anatomist of melancholy, the professed
author of the poem.</p>
<p>"The Old and Young Courtier" may be found in the <emphasis>Percy Reliques</emphasis>. Lamb
copied it into one of his Commonplace Books.</p>

<p>This book, in two volumes, was published by C. &amp; J. Ollier in 1818: the
first volume containing the dedication to Coleridge that is here printed
on page 1, all of Lamb's poetry that he then wished to preserve, "John
Woodvil," "The Witch," the "Fragments of Burton," "Rosamund Gray" and
"Recollections of Christ's Hospital;" the second volume, dedicated to
Martin Charles Burney in the sonnet on page 45, containing criticisms,
essays and "Mr. H."</p>
<p>The scheme of the present volume makes it impossible to keep together
the poetical portion of Lamb's <emphasis>Works</emphasis>. In order, however, to present
clearly to the reader Lamb's mature selection, in 1818, of the poetry by
which he wished to be known, I have indicated the position in his
<emphasis>Works</emphasis> of those poems that have already been printed on earlier pages.</p>

as being in love with for some years while I lived at Pentonville,
though I had never spoken to her in my life. She died about a month
since."</p>
<p>Hester Savory was the daughter of Joseph Savory, a goldsmith in the</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

died in February of the following year, and was buried at Bunhill</p>

Fields. Lamb was living in Pentonville from the end of 1796 until 1799.</p>

<p>Page 34. <emphasis>A Farewell to Tobacco.</emphasis></p>
<p>First printed in <emphasis>The Reflector</emphasis>, No. IV., 1811.</p>
<p>Lamb had begun to think poetically of tobacco as early as 1803. Writing
to Coleridge in April 13 of that year, he says:—"What do you think of
smoking? I want your sober, <emphasis>average, noon opinion</emphasis> of it. I generally
am eating my dinner about the time I should determine it. Morning is a
girl, and can't smoke—she's no evidence one way or the other; and Night
is so [? evidently] <emphasis>bought over</emphasis>, that he can't be a very upright
judge. May be the truth is, that <emphasis>one</emphasis> pipe is wholesome; <emphasis>two</emphasis> pipes
toothsome; <emphasis>three</emphasis> pipes noisome; <emphasis>four</emphasis> pipes fulsome; <emphasis>five</emphasis> pipes
quarrelsome; and that's the <emphasis>sum</emphasis> on't. But that is deciding rather upon
rhyme than reason."</p>
<p>Writing to William and Dorothy Wordsworth on September 28, 1805, Lamb
remarked regarding his literary plans:—"Sometimes I think of a
farce—but hitherto all schemes have gone off,—an idle brag or two of
an evening vaporing out of a pipe, and going off in the morning—but now
I have bid farewell to my 'Sweet Enemy' Tobacco, as you will see in my
next page, I perhaps shall set soberly to work. Hang work!"</p>
<p>On the next page Lamb copied the "Farewell to Tobacco," adding:—"I wish
you may think this a handsome farewell to my 'Friendly Traitress.'
Tobacco has been my evening comfort and my morning curse for these five
years: and you know how difficult it is from refraining to pick one's
lips even when it has become a habit. This Poem is the only one which I
have finished since so long as when I wrote 'Hester Savory' [in March,
1803]…. The 'Tobacco,' being a little in the way of Withers (whom
Southey so much likes), perhaps you will somehow convey it to him with
my kind remembrances."</p>
<p>Mr. Bertram Dobell has a MS. copy of the poem, in Lamb's hand, inscribed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

thus: "To his <emphasis>quondam</emphasis> Brethren of the Pipe, Capt. B[urney], and J[ohn]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

R[ickman], Esq., the Author dedicates this his last Farewell to</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tobacco." At the end is a rude drawing of a pipe broken—"My Emblem."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>It is perhaps hardly needful to say that Lamb's farewell was not final.
He did not give up smoking for many years. When asked (Talfourd's
version of the story says by Dr. Parr) how he was able to emit such
volumes of smoke, he replied, "I toiled after it, sir, as some men toil
after virtue;" and Macready records having heard Lamb express the wish
to draw his last breath through a pipe and exhale it in a pun. Talfourd
says that in late life Lamb ceased to smoke except very occasionally.
But the late Mrs. Coe, who knew Lamb at Widford when she was a child,
told me that she remembered Lamb's black pipe and his devotion to it,
about 1830.</p>
<p>In his character sketch of the late Elia (see Vol. II.), written in
1822, Lamb describes the effect of tobacco upon himself. "He took it, he
would say, as a solvent of speech. Marry—as the friendly vapour
ascended, how his prattle would curl up sometimes with it! the
ligaments, which tongue-tied him, were loosened, and the stammerer
proceeded a statist!"</p>

<p>First printed in <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis>, January 1, 1815.</p>
<p>The lines are to Thornton Leigh Hunt, Leigh Hunt's little boy, who was
born in 1810, and, during his father's imprisonment for a libel on the
Regent from February, 1813, to February, 1815, was much in the Surrey
gaol. Lamb, who was among Hunt's constant visitors, probably first saw
him there. Lamb mentions him again in his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "Witches and
other Night Fears." See also note to the "Letter to Southey," Vol. I.
Thornton Leigh Hunt became a journalist, and held an important post on
the <emphasis>Daily Telegraph</emphasis>. He died in 1873.</p>
<p>When printed in Leigh Hunt's <emphasis>Examiner</emphasis>, signed C.L., the poem had
these prefatory words by the editor:—</p>
<p>  The following piece perhaps we had some personal reasons for not
  admitting, but we found more for the contrary; and could not resist
  the pleasure of contemplating together the author and the object of his
  address,—to one of whom the Editor is owing for some of the lightest
  hours of his captivity, and to the other for a main part of its continual
  solace.</p>

<p>Writing to Dorothy Wordsworth on June 14, 1805, Lamb says: "You had her
[Mary's] Lines about the 'Lady Blanch.' You have not had some which she
wrote upon a copy of a girl from Titian, which I had hung up where that
print of Blanch and the Abbess (as she beautifully interpreted two
female figures from L. da Vinci) had hung, in our room. 'Tis light and
pretty."</p>

<p>This was the picture, one version of which hangs in the National

<empty-line/>
<p>Page 42. <emphasis>On the Same</emphasis>. By Mary Lamb.</p>
<p>In the letter to Dorothy Wordsworth of June 14, 1805, quoted just above,
Lamb says: "I cannot resist transcribing three or four Lines which poor
Mary [she was at this time away from home in one of her enforced
absences] made upon a Picture (a Holy Family) which we saw at an Auction
only one week before she left home…. They are sweet Lines, and upon a
sweet Picture."</p>
<p>Mary Lamb wrote little verse besides the <emphasis>Poetry for Children</emphasis> (see
Vol. III. of this edition). To the pieces that are printed in the
present volume I would add the lines suggested by the death of Captain
John Wordsworth, the poet's brother, in the foundering of the
<emphasis>Abergavenny</emphasis> in February, 1805, when Coleridge was in Malta, which were
sent by Mary Lamb to Dorothy Wordsworth, May 7, 1805:—</p>
<p>      Why is he wandering on the sea?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Coleridge should now with Wordsworth be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      By slow degrees he'd steal away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Their woe, and gently bring a ray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (So happily he'd time relief)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of comfort from their very grief.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      He'd tell them that their brother dead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When years have passed o'er their head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Will be remember'd with such holy,</p>

<p>

      True, and perfect melancholy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That ever this lost brother John</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>Frances Maria Kelly (1790-1882)—or Fanny Kelly, as she was usually
called—was Lamb's favourite actress of his middle and later life and a
personal friend of himself and his sister: so close that Lamb proposed
marriage to her. See Lamb's criticisms of Miss Kelly's acting in Vol.
I., and notes. Another sonnet addressed by Lamb to Miss Kelly will be
found on page 59 of the present volume.</p>

<p>John Lamb, Charles's father, came from Lincoln. A recollection of his
boyhood there is given in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "Poor Relations." The
"stream" seems completely to have ended with Charles Lamb and his sister
Mary: at least, research has yielded no descendants.</p>
<p>Crabb Robinson visited Goethe in the summer of 1829. The <emphasis>Diary</emphasis> has
this entry: "I inquired whether he knew the name of Lamb. 'Oh, yes! Did
he not write a pretty sonnet on his own name?' Charles Lamb, though he
always affected contempt for Goethe, yet was manifestly pleased that his
name was known to him."</p>
<p>In the little memoir of Lamb prefixed by M. Amédée Pichot to a French
edition of the <emphasis>Tales from Shakespeare</emphasis> in 1842 the following
translation of this sonnet is given:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                   MON NOM DE FAMILLE</strong></p>

<p>John Lamb, Charles's brother, was born in 1763 and was thus by twelve
years his senior. At the time this poem appeared, in 1818, he was
accountant of the South-Sea House. He died on October 26, 1821 (see the
<emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essays "My Relations" and "Dream Children").</p>

<p>Page 45. <emphasis>To Martin Charles Burney, Esq.</emphasis></p>
<p>Lamb prefixed this sonnet to Vol. II. of his <emphasis>Works</emphasis>, 1818. In Vol. I.
he had placed the dedication to Coleridge which we have already seen.
Martin Charles Burney was the son of Rear-Admiral James Burney, Lamb's
old friend, and nephew of Madame d'Arblay. He was a barrister by
profession; dabbled a little in authorship; was very quaint in some of
his ways and given to curiously intense and sudden enthusiasms; and was
devoted to Mary Lamb and her brother. When these two were at work on
their <emphasis>Tales from Shakespear</emphasis> Martin Burney would sit with them and
attempt to write for children too. Lamb's letter of May 24, 1830, to
Sarah Hazlitt has some amusing stories of his friend, at whom (like
George Dyer) he could laugh as well as love. Lamb speaks of him on one
occasion as on the top round of his ladder of friendship. Writing to
Sarah Hazlitt, Lamb says:—"Martin Burney is as good, and as odd as
ever. We had a dispute about the word 'heir,' which I contended was
pronounced like 'air'; he said that might be in common parlance; or that
we might so use it, speaking of the 'Heir at Law,' a comedy; but that in
the law courts it was necessary to give it a full aspiration, and to say
<emphasis>hayer</emphasis>; he thought it might even vitiate a cause, if a counsel
pronounced it otherwise. In conclusion, he 'would consult Serjeant
Wilde,' who gave it against him. Sometimes he falleth into the water;
sometimes into the fire. He came down here, and insisted on reading
Virgil's 'Eneid' all through with me (which he did), because a Counsel
must know Latin. Another time he read out all the Gospel of St. John,
because Biblical quotations are very emphatic in a Court of Justice. A
third time, he would carve a fowl, which he did very ill-favouredly,
because 'we did not know how indispensable it was for a barrister to do
all those sort of things well? Those little things were of more
consequence than we supposed.' So he goes on, harassing about the way to
prosperity, and losing it. With a long head, but somewhat a wrong
one——harum-scarum. Why does not his guardian angel look to him? He
deserves one: may be, he has tired him out."</p>
<p>Martin Burney, of whom another glimpse is caught in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay
"Detached Thoughts on Books and Reading," died in 1860. At Mary Lamb's
funeral he was inconsolable.</p>

<p>Page 46. CHARLES LAMB'S <emphasis>ALBUM VERSES</emphasis>, 1830.</p>
<p>The publication of this volume, in 1830, was due more to Lamb's kindness
of heart than to any desire to come before the world again as a poet.
But Edward Moxon, Lamb's young friend, was just starting his publishing
business, with Samuel Rogers as a financial patron; and Lamb, who had
long been his chief literary adviser, could not well refuse the request
to help him with a new book. <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis> became thus the first of the
many notable books of poetry which Moxon was to issue between 1830 and
1858, the year of his death. Among them Tennyson's <emphasis>Poems</emphasis>, 1833 and
1842; <emphasis>The Princess</emphasis>, 1847; <emphasis>In Memoriam</emphasis>, 1850; <emphasis>Maud</emphasis>, 1855; and
Browning's <emphasis>Sordello</emphasis>, 1840, and <emphasis>Bells and Pomegranates</emphasis>, 1843-1846.</p>
<p>The dedication of <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis> tells the story of its being:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>"DEDICATION</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>"TO THE PUBLISHER</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>"DEAR MOXON,</strong></p>
<p>"I do not know to whom a Dedication of these Trifles is more properly
due than to yourself. You suggested the printing of them. You were
desirous of exhibiting a specimen of the <emphasis>manner</emphasis> in which Publications,
entrusted to your future care, would appear. With more propriety,
perhaps, the 'Christmas,' or some other of your own simple, unpretending
Compositions, might have served this purpose. But I forget—you have bid
a long adieu to the Muses. I had on my hands sundry Copies of Verses
written for <emphasis>Albums</emphasis>—</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>      "Those Books kept by modern young Ladies for show,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of which their plain grandmothers nothing did know—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"or otherwise floating about in Periodicals; which you have chosen in
this manner to embody. I feel little interest in their publication. They
are simply—<emphasis>Advertisement Verses</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"It is not for me, nor you, to allude in public to the kindness of our
honoured Friend, under whose auspices you are become a Bookseller. May
that fine-minded Veteran in Verse enjoy life long enough to see his
patronage justified! I venture to predict that your habits of industry,
and your cheerful spirit, will carry you through the world.</p>
<p>"I am, Dear Moxon,</p>
<p>"Your Friend and sincere Well-wisher, CHARLES LAMB.</p>
<p>"ENFIELD, <emphasis>1st June, 1830</emphasis>."</p>
<p>The reference to "Christmas" is to Moxon's poem of that name, published
in 1829, and dedicated to Lamb.—The couplet concerning Albums is from
one of Lamb's own pieces (see page 104).—The Veteran in Verse was
Samuel Rogers, who, then sixty-seven, lived yet another twenty-five
years. Moxon published the superb editions of his <emphasis>Italy</emphasis> and his
<emphasis>Poems</emphasis> illustrated by Turner and Stothard.</p>
<p>Lamb's motives in issuing <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis> were cruelly misunderstood by
the <emphasis>Literary Gazette</emphasis> (edited by William Jerdan). In the number for
July 10, 1830, was printed a contemptuous review beginning with this
passage:—</p>
<p>  If any thing could prevent our laughing at the present collection of
  absurdities, it would be a lamentable conviction of the blinding and
  engrossing nature of vanity. We could forgive the folly of the original
  composition, but cannot but marvel at the egotism which has preserved,
  and the conceit which has published.</p>
<p>Lamb himself probably was not much disturbed by Jerdan's venom, but
Southey took it much to heart, and a few weeks later sent to <emphasis>The Times</emphasis>
(of August 6, 1830) the following lines in praise of his friend:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                   TO CHARLES LAMB</strong></p>
<p>      On the Reviewal of his <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis> in the <emphasis>Literary Gazette</emphasis>.</p>
<p>      Charles Lamb, to those who know thee justly dear,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For rarest genius, and for sterling worth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Unchanging friendship, warmth of heart sincere,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And wit that never gave an ill thought birth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Nor ever in its sport infix'd a sting;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To us who have admired and loved thee long,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      It is a proud as well as pleasant thing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To hear thy good report, now borne along</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Upon the honest breath of public praise:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      We know that with the elder sons of song,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In honouring whom thou hast delighted still,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Thy name shall keep its course to after days.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The empty pertness, and the vulgar wrong,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The flippant folly, the malicious will,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Which have assailed thee, now, or heretofore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Find, soon or late, their proper meed of shame;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      The more thy triumph, and our pride the more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When witling critics to the world proclaim,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In lead, their own dolt incapacity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Matter it is of mirthful memory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      To think, when thou wert early in the field,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      How doughtily small Jeffrey ran at thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A-tilt, and broke a bulrush on thy shield.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And now, a veteran in the lists of fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I ween, old Friend! thou art not worse bested</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      When with a maudlin eye and drunken aim,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Dulness hath thrown a <emphasis>jerdan</emphasis> at thy head.</p>

<p><strong>                                            SOUTHEY.</strong></p>
<p>This was, I think, Southey's first public utterance concerning Lamb
since Lamb's famous open letter to him of October, 1823 (see Vol. I.).</p>
<p>Lamb wrote to Bernard Barton in the same month: "How noble … in R.S.
to come forward for an old friend who had treated him so unworthily,"
For the critics, Lamb said in the same letter, he did not care the "five
hundred thousandth part of a half-farthing;" and we can believe him. On
page 123 will be found, however, an epigram on the <emphasis>Literary Gazette</emphasis>.</p>

afterwards became the wife of Edward FitzGerald, the translator of Omar
Khayyam, lived until November 27, 1898. She retained her faculties
almost to the end, and in 1892 kindly wrote out for me her memory of a
visit paid with her father to the Lambs at Colebrook Row about 1825—a

Mary Victoria Novello, whom he married in 1828 and who died as recently
as 1898. Their <emphasis>Recollections of Writers,</emphasis> 1878, have many interesting
reminiscences of Charles and Mary Lamb. Writing to Cowden Clarke on
February 25, 1828, Lamb says:—"I had a pleasant letter from your
sister, greatly over acknowledging my poor sonnet…. Alas for
sonnetting,'tis as the nerves are; all the summer I was dawdling among
green lanes, and verses came as thick as fancies. I am sunk winterly
below prose and zero."</p>

the poem. Lamb sent the verses to Hood in May, 1827.</p>
<p>This is, I think, in many ways Lamb's most remarkable poem.</p>
<p>Hood's own poem on the same event, printed in <emphasis>Memorials of Thomas

next line, besides the nonsense of 'but' there, as it now stands. And I
request you, as a personal favor to me, to erase the last line of all,
which I should never have written from myself. The fact is, it was a
silly joke of Hood's, who gave me the frame, (you judg'd rightly it was
not its own,) with the remark that you would like it because it was
b——-d b——-d [the last line in question was 'And broad brimmed, as
the owner's calling'] and I lugg'd it in: but I shall be quite hurt if
it stands, because tho' you and yours have too good sense to object to
it, I would not have a sentence of mine seen that to any foolish ear
might sound unrespectful to thee. Let it end at 'appalling.'"</p>

<p>Page 56. <emphasis>The Young Catechist</emphasis>.  Lamb sent this poem to Barton in a
letter in 1827, wherein he tells the story of its inception:—"An artist
who painted me lately, had painted a Blackamoor praying, and not filling
his canvas, stuff'd in his little girl aside of Blacky, gaping at him
unmeaningly; and then didn't know what to call it. Now for a picture to
be promoted to the Exhibition (Suffolk Street) as Historical, a subject
is requisite. What does me. I but christen it the 'Young Catechist,' and
furbishd it with Dialogue following, which dubb'd it an Historical
Painting. Nothing to a friend at need…. When I'd done it the Artist
(who had clapt in Miss merely as a fill-space) swore I exprest his full
meaning, and the damsel bridled up into a Missionary's vanity. I like
verses to explain Pictures: seldom Pictures to illustrate Poems."</p>
<p>The artist was Henry Meyer (1782?-1847), one of the foundation members
of the Society of British Artists in Suffolk Street, to the exhibition
of which in 1826 he sent his portrait of Lamb, now in the India Office.
This picture was in a shop in the Charing Cross Road in 1910.</p>

<p>The young friend was Emma Isola, who lived with the Lambs for some years
as their adopted daughter. Emma Isola was the daughter of Charles Isola,
Esquire Bedell of the University of Cambridge, who died in 1823, leaving
her unprovided for. His father, and Emma Isola's grandfather, was
Agostino Isola, who settled at Cambridge and taught Italian there.
Wordsworth was among his pupils. He edited a collection of <emphasis>Pieces
selected from the Italian Poets</emphasis>, 1778; also editions of <emphasis>Gerusalemme
Liberata</emphasis> and <emphasis>Orlando Furioso</emphasis>, and a book of <emphasis>Italian Dialogues</emphasis>. Emma
Isola is first mentioned by Lamb in an unpublished letter written to her
aunt, Miss Humphreys, in January, 1821, arranging for the little girl's
return to Trumpington Street, Cambridge, from London, where she had been
spending her holidays with the Lambs. The Lambs had met her at Cambridge
in the summer of 1820. The exact date of her adoption by the Lambs
cannot be ascertained now. Emma Isola married Edward Moxon in 1833, and
lived until 1891.</p>

<p>Writing to Procter in January, 1829, Lamb calls Miss Isola "a silent
brown girl," and in his letter of November, 1833, to Mr. and Mrs. Moxon,
he says: "I hope you [Moxon] and Emma will have many a quarrel and many
a make-up (and she is beautiful in reconciliation!) …" See the poem
"To a Friend on His Marriage," page 80, for a further description of
Emma Isola's character.</p>

<p>This sonnet was first printed in <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis>, August 29 and 30, 1819,
and was dated August 15. Lamb, we now know, from a letter recently
discovered, was in Cambridge in August, 1819, just after being refused
by Miss Kelly. Hazlitt in his essay "On the Conversation of Authors" in
the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for September, 1820, referred to Lamb's visit to
him some years before, and his want of ease among rural surroundings,
adding: "But when we cross the country to Oxford, then he spoke a
little. He and the old collegers were hail-fellow-well-met: and in the
quadrangle he 'walked gowned.'"</p>

"Sonnet."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Many years earlier we see the germ of this sonnet in Lamb's mind, as
indeed we see the germ of so many ideas that were not fully expressed
till later, for he always kept his thoughts at call. Writing to
Wordsworth in September, 1805, he says:—"Hang work! I wish that all the
year were holyday. I am sure that Indolence indefeasible Indolence is
the true state of man, and business the invention of the Old Teazer who
persuaded Adam's Master to give him an apron and set him a-houghing. Pen
and Ink and Clerks, and desks, were the refinements of this old torturer
a thousand years after…."</p>
<p>Lamb probably was as fond of this sonnet as of anything he wrote in what
might be called his second poetical period. He copied it into his first
letter to Bernard Barton, in September, 1822, and he drew attention to
it in his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "The Superannuated Man."</p>

<p>Page 60. <emphasis>Leisure</emphasis>.</p>
<p>First printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for April, 1821, probably, I
think, as a protest against the objection taken by some persons to the
opinions expressed by Lamb in his essay on "New Year's Eve" in that
magazine for January (see Vol. II., and notes). Lamb had therein said,
speaking of death:—"I am not content to pass away 'like a weaver's
shuttle.' Those metaphors solace me not, nor sweeten the unpalatable
draught of mortality. I care not to be carried with the tide, that
smoothly bears human life to eternity; and reluct at the inevitable
course of destiny. I am in love with this green earth; the face of town
and country; the unspeakable rural solitudes, and the sweet security of
streets. I would set up my tabernacle here. I am content to stand still
at the age to which I am arrived; I, and my friends. To be no younger,
no richer, no handsomer. I do not want to be weaned by age; or drop,
like mellow fruit, as they say, into the grave."</p>
<p>Such sentiments probably called forth some private as well as public
protests; and it was, as I imagine, in a whimsical wish to emphasise the
sincerity of his regard for life that Lamb reiterated that devotion in
the emphatic words of "Leisure" in the April number. This sonnet was a
special favourite with Edward FitzGerald.</p>
<p>It is sad to think that Lamb, when his leisure came, had too much of it.
Writing to Barton on July 25, 1829, during one of his sister's
illnesses, he says: "I bragg'd formerly that I could not have too much
time. I have a surfeit…. I am a sanguinary murderer of time, that
would kill him inchmeal just now."</p>

<p>Page 60. <emphasis>To Samuel Rogers, Esq</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Daniel Rogers, the poet's elder brother, died in 1829. In acknowledging
Lamb's sonnet, Samuel Rogers wrote the following letter, which Lamb
described to Barton (July 3, 1829) as the prettiest he ever read.</p>
<p>  Many, many thanks. The verses are beautiful. I need not say with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  what feelings they were read. Pray accept the grateful</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

  of us all, and believe me when I say that nothing could have been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  a greater cordial to us in our affliction than such a testimony from such</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  a quarter. He was—for none knew him so well—we were born within a</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  year or two of each other—a man of a very high mind, and with less</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  disguise than perhaps any that ever lived. Whatever he was, <emphasis>that</emphasis> we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  saw. He stood before his fellow beings (if I may be forgiven for saying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  so) almost as before his Maker: and God grant that we may all bear</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  as severe an examination. He was an admirable scholar. His Dante</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  and his Homer were as familiar to him as his Alphabets: and he had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  the tenderest heart. When a flock of turkies was stolen from his farm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  the indignation of the poor far and wide was great and loud. To me he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  is the greatest loss, for we were nearly of an age; and there is now no</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<p>Page 61. <emphasis>The Gipsy's Malison</emphasis>.</p>
<p>First printed in <emphasis>Blackwood's Magazine</emphasis>, January, 1829. Lamb had sent it
to <emphasis>The Gem</emphasis>, but, as he told Procter in a letter on January 22, 1829:
"The editors declined it, on the plea that it would <emphasis>shock all mothers;</emphasis>
so they published the 'Widow' [Hood's parody of Lamb] instead. I am born
out of time. I have no conecture about what the present world calls
delicacy. I thought <emphasis>Rosamund Gray</emphasis> was a pretty modest thing. Hessey
assures me that the world would not bear it. I have lived to grow into
an indecent character. When my sonnet was rejected, I exclaimed,
'Hang[27] the age, I will write for Antiquity!'"</p>
<p>In another letter to Procter, Lamb tells the sonnet's history:—</p>
<p>"<emphasis>January</emphasis> 29, 1829.</p>
<p>"When Miss Ouldcroft (who is now Mrs. Beddam [Badams], and Bed-dam'd to
her!) was at Enfield, which she was in summer-time, and owed her health
to its suns and genial influences, she visited (with young lady-like
impertinence) a poor man's cottage that had a pretty baby (O the
yearnling!), gave it fine caps and sweetmeats. On a day, broke into the
parlour our two maids uproarious. 'O ma'am, who do you think Miss
Ouldcroft (they pronounce it Holcroft) has been working a cap for?' 'A
child," answered Mary, in true Shandean female simplicity.' 'Tis the
man's child as was taken up for sheep-stealing.' Miss Ouldcroft was
staggered, and would have cut the connection; but by main force I made
her go and take her leave of her protégée. I thought, if she went no
more, the Abactor or the Abactor's wife (<emphasis>vide</emphasis> Ainsworth) would suppose
she had heard something; and I have delicacy for a sheep-stealer. The
overseers actually overhauled a mutton-pie at the baker's (his first,
last, and only hope of mutton pie), which he never came to eat, and
thence inferred his guilt. <emphasis>Per occasionem cujus</emphasis>, I framed the sonnet;
observe its elaborate construction. I was four days about it. [Here came
the sonnet.] Barry, study that sonnet. It is curiously and perversely
elaborate. 'Tis a choking subject, and therefore the reader is directed
to the structure of it. See you? and was this a fourteener to be
rejected by a trumpery annual? forsooth,'twould shock all mothers; and
may all mothers, who would so be shocked, be damned! as if mothers were
such sort of logicians as to infer the future hanging of <emphasis>their</emphasis> child
from the theoretical hangibility (or capacity of being hanged, if the
judge pleases) of every infant born with a neck on. Oh B.C.! my whole
heart is faint, and my whole head is sick (how is it?) at this damned
canting unmasculine age!"</p>

<p>Barry Cornwall was the pen-name of Bryan Waller Procter, 1787-1874,
whose impulse to write poetry came largely from Lamb himself. In his
<emphasis>Dramatic Scenes</emphasis>, 1819, was the beginning of a blank-verse treatment or
adaptation of Lamb's "Rosamund Gray." Procter addressed to Lamb some
excellent lines "Over a Flask of Sherris," which were printed in the
<emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, 1825, and again in <emphasis>English Songs</emphasis>, 1832. His
<emphasis>Martian Colonna; an Italian Tale</emphasis>, was published in 1820 and his
<emphasis>Sicilian Story</emphasis> later in the same year. The "Dream" was printed in
<emphasis>Dramatic Scenes</emphasis>. Procter in his old age wrote a charming memoir of
Lamb.</p>

<p>First printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, September, 1820. By a curious
oversight the error in Knowles's initials was repeated in the <emphasis>Album
Verses</emphasis>, 1830, Knowles's first name being, of course, James. James
Sheridan Knowles (1784-1862) had been a doctor, a schoolmaster, an
actor, and a travelling elocutionist, before he took seriously to
writing for the stage. His first really successful play was "Virginius,"
written for Edmund Kean, transferred to Macready, and produced in 1820.
His greatest triumph was "The Hunchback," 1832. Lamb, who met Knowles
through William Hazlitt, of Wem, the essayist's father, wrote both the
prologue and epilogue for Knowles's play "The Wife," 1833 (see pages
146-7).</p>

<p>First printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, May, 1825, and copied by Hone
into the <emphasis>Every-Day Book</emphasis> for July 9 of the same year. William Hone (see
Vol. I. notes), 1780-1842, was a bookseller, pamphleteer and antiquary,
who, before he took to editing his <emphasis>Every-Day Book</emphasis> in 1825, had passed
through a stormy career on account of his critical outspokenness and
want of ordinary political caution; and Lamb did by no means a
fashionable thing when he commended Hone thus publicly. The <emphasis>Every-Day
Book</emphasis>, begun in 1825, was, when published in 1826, dedicated by Hone to
Charles Lamb and his sister. "Your daring to publish me your 'friend,'
with your 'proper name' annexed," Hone wrote, "I shall never forget."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 63. Acrostics.</p>
<p>In his more leisurely years, at Islington and Enfield, Lamb wrote a
great number of acrostics—many more probably than have been
preserved—of which these, printed in <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis>, are all that he
cared to see in print. Probably he found his chief impulse in Emma
Isola's schoolfellows and friends, who must have been very eager to
obtain in their albums a contribution from so distinguished a gentleman
as Elia, and who passed on their requests through his adopted daughter.
I have not been able to trace the identity of several of them. The lady
who desired her epitaph was Mrs. Williams in whose house Emma Isola was
governess. While there Emma was seriously ill, and Lamb travelled down
to Fornham, in Suffolk, in 1830, to bring her home. On returning he
wrote Mrs. Williams several letters, in one of which, dated Good Friday,
he said:—"I beg you to have inserted in your county paper something
like this advertisement; 'To the nobility, gentry, and others, about
Bury,—C. Lamb respectfully informs his friends and the public in
general, that he is leaving off business in the acrostic line, as he is
going into an entirely new line. Rebuses and Charades done as usual, and
upon the old terms. Also, Epitaphs to suit the memory of any person
deceased.'"</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams probably then suggested that Lamb should write her
epitaph, for in his next letter he says:—"I have ventured upon some
lines, which combine my old acrostic talent (which you first found out)
with my new profession of epitaphmonger. As you did not please to say,
when you would die, I have left a blank space for the date. May kind
heaven be a long time in filling it up."</p>
<p>On page 48 will be found some lines to one of Mrs. Williams' daughters.
The acrostic on page 65 is to another. These would both be Emma Isola's
pupils.</p>

<p><strong>TRANSLATIONS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 66. <emphasis>Translations from Vincent Bourne</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Vincent Bourne (1695-1747), the English Latin poet, entered Westminster
School on the foundation in 1710, and, on leaving Cambridge, returned to
Westminster as a master. He was so indolent a teacher and disciplinarian
that Cowper, one of his pupils, says: "He seemed determined, as he was
the best, so to be the last, Latin poet of the Westminster line."
Bourne's <emphasis>Poemata</emphasis> appeared in 1734. It is mainly owing to Cowper's
translations (particularly "The Jackdaw") that he is known, except to
Latinists. Lamb first read Bourne in 1815. Writing to Wordsworth in
April of that year he says:—"Since I saw you I have had a treat in the
reading way which comes not every day. The Latin Poems of V. Bourne
which were quite new to me. What a heart that man had, all laid out upon
town and scenes, a proper counterpoise to <emphasis>some people's</emphasis> rural
extravaganzas. Why I mention him is that your Power of Music reminded me
of his poem of the ballad singer in the Seven Dials. Do you remember his
epigram on the old woman who taught Newton the A B C, which after all he
says he hesitates not to call Newton's <emphasis>Principia</emphasis>? I was lately
fatiguing myself with going through a volume of fine words by L'd
Thurlow, excellent words, and if the heart could live by words alone, it
could desire no better regale, but what an aching vacuum of matter—I
don't stick at the madness of it, for that is only a consequence of
shutting his eyes and thinking he is in the age of the old Elisabeth
poets—from thence I turned to V. Bourne—what a sweet unpretending
pretty-mannered <emphasis>matter-ful</emphasis> creature, sucking from every flower, making
a flower of every thing—his diction all Latin, and his thoughts all
English. Bless him, Latin wasn't good enough for him—why wasn't he
content with the language which Gay and Prior wrote in."</p>
<p>On the publication of <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis>, wherein these nine poems from
Vincent Bourne were printed, Lamb reviewed the book in Moxon's
<emphasis>Englishman's Magazine</emphasis> for September, 1831, under the title "The Latin
Poems of Vincent Bourne" (see Vol. I.). There he quoted "The Ballad
Singers," and the "Epitaph on an Infant Sleeping"—remarking of
Bourne:—"He is 'so Latin,' and yet 'so English' all the while. In
diction worthy of the Augustan age, he presents us with no images that
are not familiar to his countrymen. His topics are even closelier drawn;
they are not so properly English, as <emphasis>Londonish</emphasis>. From the streets, and
from the alleys, of his beloved metropolis, he culled his objects, which
he has invested with an Hogarthian richness of colouring. No town
picture by that artist can go beyond his BALLAD-SINGERS; Gay's TRIVIA
alone, in verse, comes up to the life and humour of it."</p>

suppose, in some cases to Lamb's earliest memories, both of London and
Hertfordshire, is a task that is probably beyond completion. The day is
too distant. But a search in the Widford register and churchyard reveals
a little information and oral tradition a little more.</p>
<p>Stanza 2. <emphasis>Rich Kitty Wheatley</emphasis>. The Rev. Joseph Whately, vicar of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Widford in the latter half of the eighteenth century, married Jane</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Plumer, sister of William Plumer, of Blakesware, the employer of Mrs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Field, Lamb's grandmother. Archbishop Whately was their son. Kitty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wheatley may have been a relative.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Stanza 2. <emphasis>Polly Perkin</emphasis>. On June 1, 1770, according to the Widford
register, Samuel Perkins married Mary Lanham. This may have been Polly.</p>
<p>Stanza 3. <emphasis>Carter … Lily</emphasis>. The late Mrs. Tween, a daughter of Randal
Norris, Lamb's friend, and a resident in Widford, told Canon Ainger that
Carter and Lily were servants at Blakesware. Lily had noticeably red
cheeks. Lamb would have seen them often when he stayed there as a boy.
In Cussan's <emphasis>Hertfordshire</emphasis> is an entertaining account of William
Plumer's widow's adhesion to the old custom of taking the air. She rode
out always—from Gilston, only a few miles from Widford and
Blakesware—in the family chariot, with outriders and postilion (a
successor to Lily), and so vast was the equipage that "turn outs" had to
be cut in the hedges (visible to this day), like sidings on a
single-line railway, to permit others to pass. The Widford register
gives John Lilley, died October 18, 1812, aged 85, and Johanna Lilley,
died January 1, 1823, aged 90. It also gives Benjamin Carter's marriage,
in 1781, but not his death.</p>
<p>Stanza 4. <emphasis>Clemitson's widow</emphasis>. Mrs. Tween told Canon Ainger that
Clemitson was the farmer of Blakesware farm. I do not find the name in
the Widford register. An Elizabeth Clemenson is there.</p>
<p>Stanza 4. <emphasis>Good Master Clapton</emphasis>. There are several Claptons in Widford
churchyard. Thirty years from 1827, the date of the poem, takes us to
1797: the Clapton whose death occurred nearest that time is John Game
Clapton, May 5, 1802.</p>
<p>Stanza 5. <emphasis>Tom Dockwra</emphasis>. I cannot find definite information either
concerning this Dockwra or the William Dockwray, of Ware, of whom Lamb
wrote in his "Table Talk" in <emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>, 1834 (see Vol. I.). There
was, however, a Joseph Docwray, of Ware, a Quaker maltster; and the late
Mrs. Coe, <emphasis>née</emphasis> Hunt, the daughter of the tenant of the water-mill at
Widford in Lamb's day, where Lamb often spent a night, told me that a
poor family named Docwray lived in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Stanza 6. <emphasis>Worral … Dorrell</emphasis>. I find neither Worral nor Dorrell in the
Widford archives, but Morrils and Morrells in plenty, and one Horrel.
Lamb alludes to old Dorrell again in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay "New Year's Eve,"
where he is accused of swindling the family out of money. Particulars of
his fraud have perished with him, but I have no doubt it is the same
William Dorrell who witnessed John Lamb's will in 1761. In the <emphasis>Table
Book</emphasis> this stanza ended thus:—</p>
<p>        With cuckoldy Worral,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And wicked old Dorrel,</p>

exceptions and several additions—under the embracive title <emphasis>The

daughter of Sir Samuel Egerton Brydges, was burned to death in 1822
under the most distressing circumstances. Rotha Quillinan, who was
Wordsworth's god-daughter, was so called from the Rotha which flows
through Rydal, close to Quillinan's house.</p>

<p>Page 80. <emphasis>To T. Stothard, Esq</emphasis>.</p>
<p>First printed in <emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>, December 21, 1833. In a letter to
Rogers in December, 1833, Lamb alludes to his sonnet to the poet (see
page 100), adding that for fear it might not altogether please Stothard
he has "ventured at an antagonist copy of verses, in <emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>, to
<emphasis>him</emphasis>, in which he is as every thing, and you [Rogers] as nothing."
Thomas Stothard (1755-1834) was at that time seventy-eight. He had long
been the friend of Rogers, having helped in the decoration of his house
in 1803 and illustrated the <emphasis>Pleasures of Memory</emphasis> as far back as 1793.
Lamb's sonnet refers particularly to the edition of Rogers' <emphasis>Poems</emphasis> that
is dated 1834, which Stothard and Turner embellished. Stothard
illustrated very many of the standard novels for Harrison's <emphasis>Novelists'
Magazine</emphasis> towards the end of the eighteenth century, among these being
Richardson's, Fielding's, Smollett's and Sterne's. In Robert Paltock's
<emphasis>Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins</emphasis>, 1751, a flying people are
described, among whom the males were "Glums" and the females
"Gawries."—Titian lived to be ninety-nine.</p>

Edward Moxon, whose marriage to Emma Isola, Lamb's adopted daughter, was
solemnised on July 30, 1833. Lamb mentions more than once the absence of
any dowry with Miss Isola. His own wedding present to them was the
portrait of Milton which his brother, John Lamb, had left to him.</p>

<p>Page 83. <emphasis>Free Thoughts on Several Eminent Composers</emphasis>.  Lamb was very
fond of these lines, which he sent to more than one of his friends. The
text varies in some of the copies, but I have not thought it necessary
to indicate the differences. Its inspiration was attributed by him both
to William Ayrton (1777-1858), the musical critic, and to Vincent
Novello (1781-1861), the organist, composer and close friend of Lamb. In
a letter to Sarah Hazlitt in 1830 Lamb copies the poem,
remarking—"Having read Hawkins and Burney recently, I was enabled to
talk [to Ayrton] of Names, and show more knowledge than he had suspected
I possessed; and in the end he begg'd me to shape my thoughts upon
paper, which I did after he was gone, and sent him."</p>
<p>So Lamb wrote to Mrs. Hazlitt. But to Ayrton, when he sent the verses,
he said:—"[Novello] desiring me to give him my real opinion respecting
the distinct grades of excellence in all the eminent Composers of the
Italian, German and English schools, I have done it, rather to oblige
him than from any overweening opinion I have of my own judgment in that
science."</p>
<p>Both these statements are manifestations of what Lamb called his
"matter-of-lie" disposition. To Mrs. Hazlitt he thought that Ayrton's
name would be more important; to Ayrton, Novello's.</p>
<p>The verses, whatever their origin, were written by Lamb in Novello's</p>

<p>Writing to John Rickman in January, 1802, Lamb says, "My editor [Dan
Stuart of the <emphasis>Morning Post</emphasis>] uniformly rejects all that I do,
considerable in length. I shall only do paragraphs with now and then a
slight poem, such as Dick Strype, if you read it, which was but a long
epigram." The verses, which appeared on January 6, 1802, may be compared
with the story of Ephraim Wagstaff, on page 432 of Vol. I., written
twenty-five years later. It has been pointed out that <emphasis>Points of
Misery</emphasis>, 1823, by Charles Molloy Westmacott (Bernard Blackmantle of the
<emphasis>English Spy</emphasis>), contains the poem with slight alterations. But
Westmacott reaped where he could, and his book is confessedly not wholly
original. Lamb seems to me to admit authorship by implication fairly
completely. Westmacott was only thirteen when it was first printed.</p>

<p>Page 88. <emphasis>Two Epitaphs on a young Lady, etc</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Morning Post</emphasis>, February 7, 1804. Signed C.L. Lamb sends the poem both
to Wordsworth and Manning in 1803. He says to Manning:—"Did I send you
an epitaph I scribbled upon a poor girl who died at nineteen?—a good
girl, and a pretty girl, and a clever girl, but strangely neglected by
all her friends and kin…. Brief, and pretty, and tender, is it not? I
send you this, being the only piece of poetry I have <emphasis>done</emphasis> since the
Muses all went with T.M. [Thomas Manning] to Paris."</p>
<p>The young lady was Mary Druitt of Wimborne who died of consumption in
1801. The verses are not on her tombstone. A letter from Lamb to his
friend Rickman (see Canon Ainger's edition), shows that it was for
Rickman that the lines were written. Lamb did not know Mary Druitt.
Writing to Rickman in February, 1802, Lamb sends the second
epitaph:—"Your own prose, or nakedly the letter which you sent me,
which was in some sort an epitaph, would do better on her gravestone
than the cold lines of a stranger."</p>

<p>Printed in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, October, 1820, where it was preceded
by these words:—</p>
<p>"To THE EDITOR</p>
<p>"Mr. Editor,—The riddling lines which I send you, were written upon a
young lady, who, from her diverting sportiveness in childhood, was named
by her friends The Ape. When the verses were written, L.M. had outgrown
the title—but not the memory of it—being in her teens, and
consequently past child-tricks. They are an endeavour to express that
perplexity, which one feels at any alteration, even supposed for the
better, in a beloved object; with a little oblique grudging at Time, who
cannot bestow new graces without taking away some portion of the older
ones, which we can ill miss.</p>
<p>"*****."</p>
<p>L.M. was Louisa Martin, who is now and then referred to in Lamb's letter
as Monkey, and to whom he addressed the lines on page 82, which come as
a sequel to the present ones. In a letter to Wordsworth, many years
later, dated February 22, 1834, Lamb asks a favour for this lady:—"The
oldest and best friends I have left are in trouble. A branch of them
(and they of the best stock of God's creatures, I believe) is
establishing a school at Carlisle; Her name is Louisa Martin … her
qualities … are the most amiable, most upright. For thirty years she
has been tried by me, and on her behaviour I would stake my soul."</p>

<p>These Latin verses were printed in <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>, May 6 and 7, 1820,
signed Carlagnulus, accompanied by this notice: "We insert, with great
pleasure, the following beautiful Latin Verses on HAYDON'S fine Picture,
and shall be obliged to any of our correspondents for a spirited
translation for our next." The following week brought one
translation—Lamb's own—signed C.L. Both were reprinted in <emphasis>The
Poetical Recreations of "The Champion"</emphasis> in 1822, and again in Tom
Taylor's <emphasis>Life of Haydon</emphasis>, 1853.</p>
<p>Benjamin Robert Haydon (1786-1846) was for six years at work upon this
picture—"Christ's Entry into Jerusalem"—which was exhibited at the
Egyptian Hall in 1820. The story goes that Mrs. Siddons established the
picture's reputation in society. While the private-view company were
assembled in doubt the great actress entered and walked across the room.
"It is completely successful," she was heard to say to Sir George
Beaumont; and then, to Haydon, "The paleness of your Christ gives it a
supernatural look." A stream of 30,000 persons followed this verdict.
The picture is now in Philadelphia.</p>

family began to be famous with Dr. Charles Burney (1726-1814), the
musician, the author of the <emphasis>History of Music</emphasis>, and the friend of Dr.
Johnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. Among his children were the Rev.
Charles Burney (1757-1817), the classical scholar and owner of the
Burney Library, now in the British Museum; Rear-Admiral James Burney
(1750-1821), who sailed with Cook, wrote the <emphasis>Chronological History of
the Discoveries in the South Sea or Pacific Ocean</emphasis>, and became a friend
of Lamb; Frances Burney, afterwards Madame d'Arblay (1752-1840), the
novelist, author of <emphasis>Evelina, Camilla</emphasis> and <emphasis>Cecilia</emphasis>; and Sarah Harriet
Burney (1770?-1844), a daughter of Dr. Burney's second wife, also a
novelist, and the author, among other stories, of <emphasis>Geraldine
Fauconberg</emphasis>. "Country Neighbours; or, The Secret," the tale that
inspired Lamb's sonnet, formed Vols. II. and III. of Sarah Burney's

<p>Every pleasure we could experience in a friend's approbation, we have
felt in receiving the following verses. They are from a writer, who of
all other men, knows how to extricate a common thing from commonness,
and to give it an underlook of pleasant consciousness and wisdom.
…The receipt of these verses has set us upon thinking of the

<p>The late Mr. Dykes Campbell thought it very likely that these charming
verses were Lamb's. I think they may be, although it is odd that he
should not have reprinted anything so pretty. Mr. Thomas Hutchinson's
belief that they are Lamb's, added to that of their discoverer, leads me
to include them confidently here. Here and there it seems impossible
that the poem could come from any other hand: line 11 for example, and
the idea in lines 13 to 16, and the statement in lines 27 and 28. None
the less it must be borne in mind that one does but conjecture. The
lines are in <emphasis>The Tickler Magazine</emphasis> for 1821.</p>

<p>Mary Lamb had other pupils in her time, among them Miss Kelly, the
actress, Mary Victoria Novello (afterwards Mrs. Cowden Clarke), and
William Hazlitt, the essayist's son. Emma was, of course, Emma Isola.
Sara Coleridge's translation of Martin Dobrizhoffer's <emphasis>Historia de
Abiponibus</emphasis> under the title <emphasis>Account of the Abipones</emphasis> was published in
1822, when she was only twenty.</p>
<p>"To think [Lamb wrote to Barton, on February 17, 1823, of Sara
Coleridge] that she should have had to toil thro' five octavos of that
cursed (I forget I write to a Quaker) Abbey pony History, and then to
abridge them to 3, and all for £113. At her years, to be doing stupid
Jesuits' Latin into English, when she should be reading or writing
Romances." Sara Coleridge's romance-writing came later, in 1837, when
her fairy tale, <emphasis>Phantasmion</emphasis>, appeared.</p>
<p>In its original form this sonnet in its fifth line ran thus:—</p>
<p>      (In new tasks hardest still the first appears).</p>
<p>Derwent Coleridge read the sonnet in 1853 in Mrs. Moxon's album, and
copying it out, sent it to his wife, saying that he wished Sissy (his
daughter Christabel) to get it by heart. He added this note: "Charles
Lamb having discovered that this Sonnet consisted but of thirteen lines,
Miss Lamb inserted the 5th, which interrupts the flow and repeats a
rhime." Derwent Coleridge goes on to suggest two alternative lines:—</p>
<p>      And hope may surely chase desponding fears</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>      Let hope encouraged chase desponding fears.</p>

particularly desired that "no natural history or useful learning, such
as Pyramids, Catacombs, Giraffes, or Adventures in Southern Africa"

<p>First printed in <emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>, July 26, 1834. Clara N—— was, of
course, Clara Anastasia Novello, daughter of Lamb's friend, Vincent
Novello (1781-1861), the organist, and herself a fine soprano singer
(see also the poem "The Sisters," on the same page). Miss Novello, who
was born on June 10, 1818, became the Countess Gigliucci, and survived
until March 12, 1908. <emphasis>Clara Novella's Reminiscences</emphasis>, compiled by her
daughter, the Contessa Valeria Gigliucci, with a memoir by Arthur Duke
Coleridge, were published in 1910. In them is this charming passage:—</p>
<p>  How I loved dear Charles Lamb! I once hid—to avoid the ignominy
  of going to bed—in the upright (cabinet) pianoforte, which in its
  lowest part had a sort of tiny cupboard. In this I fell asleep, awakening
  only when the party was supping. My appearance from beneath the
  pianoforte was hailed with surprise by all, and with anger from my
  mother; but Charles Lamb not only took me under his protection, but
  obtained that henceforth I should never again be sent to bed <emphasis>when he
  came</emphasis>, but—glory and delight!—always sit up to supper. Later, in
  Frith Street days, my Father made me sing to him one day; but [Lamb]
  stopped me, saying, "Clara, don't make that d—d noise!" for which,
  I think, I loved him as much as for all the rest. Some verses he sent
  me were addressed to "St. Clara."</p>
<p>In spite of Lamb's declaration about himself and want of musical sense,
both Crabb Robinson and Barron Field tell us that he was capable of
humming tunes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 101. <emphasis>The Sisters</emphasis>.</p>
<p>These verses, printed in Mr. W.C. Hazlitt's <emphasis>Lamb and Hazlitt</emphasis>, 1900,
were addressed:—</p>
<p>        "<emphasis>For</emphasis> SAINT CECILIA,</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>They were signed C. Lamb. One might imagine Emma, the nut-brown maid, to
be Emma Isola, as that was a phrase Lamb was fond of applying to
her—assuming the title "The Sisters" to be a pleasantry; but the late
Miss Mary Sabilia Novello assured me that the sisters were herself,
Emma Aloysia Novello and Clara Anastasia Novello (see above).</p>

<p>Page 102. <emphasis>Love will Come</emphasis>.</p>
<p>"Love will Come" was included by Lamb in a letter to Miss Fryer, a
school-fellow of Emma Isola. Lamb writes:—"By desire of Emma I have
attempted new words to the old nonsense of Tartar Drum; but <emphasis>with</emphasis> the
nonsense the sound and spirit of the tune are unaccountably gone, and
<emphasis>we</emphasis> have agreed to discard the new version altogether. As <emphasis>you</emphasis> may be
more fastidious in singing mere silliness, and a string of well-sounding
images without sense or coherence—Drums of Tartars, who use <emphasis>none</emphasis>, and
Tulip trees ten foot high, not to mention Spirits in Sunbeams,
&amp;c.,—than <emphasis>we</emphasis> are, so you are at liberty to sacrifice an enspiriting
movement to a little sense, tho' I like LITTLE SENSE less than his
vagarying younger sister NO SENSE—so I send them.—The 4th line of 1st
stanza is from an old Ballad."</p>
<p>The old ballad is, I imagine, "Waly, Waly," of which Lamb was very fond.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>Page 104. <emphasis>What is an Album?</emphasis></p>
<p>These lines were probably written for Emma Isola's Album, which must not
be confounded with her Extract Book. The Album was the volume for which
Lamb, in his letters, occasionally solicited contributions. It was sold
some years ago to Mr. Quaritch, and is now, I believe, in a private
collection, although in a mutilated state, several of the poems having
been cut out. These particular lines of Lamb's were probably written by
him also in other albums, for John Mathew Gutch, his old school-fellow,
discovered them on the fly-leaf of a copy of <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>, and sent
them to <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>, Oct. 11, 1856. In that version the
twenty-first line ran:—</p>
<p>    There you have, Madelina, an album complete.</p>
<p>Lamb quoted from the lines in his review of his <emphasis>Album Verses</emphasis>, under
the title "The Latin Poems of Vincent Bourne," in the <emphasis>Englishman's
Magazine</emphasis> (see Vol. I.). Two versions of the lines are copied by Lamb
into one of his Commonplace Books.</p>
<p>Line 6. <emphasis>Sweet L.E.L.'s</emphasis>. L.E.L. was, of course, Letitia Elizabeth
Landon, afterwards Mrs. Maclean (1802-1838), famous as an Album-and
Annual-poetess. Lamb, if an entry in P.G. Patmore's diary is correct,
did not admire her, or indeed any female author. He said, "If she
belonged to me I would lock her up and feed her on bread and water till
she left off writing poetry."</p>

<p>See note above. In writing to Mrs. Williams on April 2, 1830, to tell of
Emma Isola's safe journey after her illness, Lamb says:—"How I employed
myself between Epping and Enfield the poor verses in the front of my
paper may inform you, which you may please to christen an Acrostic in a
Cross Road."</p>
<p>Mrs. Williams replied with the following acrostic upon Lamb's name,
which Mr. Cecil Turner, a descendant, has sent me and which I give
according to his copy:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>      TO CHARLES LAMB</strong></p>

<empty-line/>
<p>The two friends were Cecilia Catherine Lawton (see page 64) and Edward
Hogg (see page 109).  In reply Lamb says (Good Friday, 1830):—"I do
assure you that your verses gratified me very much, and my sister is
quite <emphasis>proud</emphasis> of them. For the first time in my life I congratulated
myself upon the shortness and meanness of my name. Had it been
Schwartzenberg or Esterhazy it would have put you to some puzzle."</p>

<section>
<p>Later in the same letter, referring to the present acrostic, he said
speaking of Harriet Isola, Emma's sister, she "blames my last verses as
being more written on <emphasis>Mr.</emphasis> Williams than on yourself; but how should I
have parted whom a Superior Power has brought together?"</p>

<p>Frances Westwood was the daughter of the Westwoods, with whom the Lambs
were domiciled at Enfield Chase in 1829-1832. See letters to Gillman and
Wordsworth (November 30, 1829, and January 22, 1830) for description of
the Westwoods. The only son, Thomas Westwood, who died in 1888, and was
an authority on the literature of angling, contributed to <emphasis>Notes and
Queries</emphasis> some very interesting reminiscences of the Lambs in those days.
This poem and that which follows it were sent to <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis> by
Thomas Westwood (June 4, 1870).</p>
<p>It is concerning these lines that Lamb writes to Barton, in 1827:—
"Adieu to Albums—for a great while—I said when I came here, and had
not been fixed two days, but my Landlord's daughter (not at the
Pot-house) requested me to write in her female friend's, and in her own.
If I go to —— thou art there also, O all pervading Album! All over the
Leeward Islands, in Newfoundland, and the Back Settlements, I understand
there is no other reading. They haunt me. I die of Albo-phobia!"</p>

walnuts better than any man Lamb knew, and munched cos-lettuce like a
rabbit (see letters to Coleridge in August, 1814). Southey and Lamb each
allowed John Morgan £10 a year in his old age and adversity, beginning

<p>Page 115. POLITICAL AND OTHER EPIGRAMS.</p>
<p>Lamb was not a politician, but he had strong—almost
passionate—prejudices against certain statesmen and higher persons,
which impelled him now and then to sarcastic verse. The earliest
examples in this vein that can be identified are two quatrains from the
<emphasis>Morning Post</emphasis> in January, 1802, printed on page 115, and the epigram
on Sir James Mackintosh in <emphasis>The Albion</emphasis>, printed on the same page, to
which Lamb refers in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on "Newspapers Thirty-five Years
Ago" (see Vol. II.). Until a file of <emphasis>The Albion</emphasis> turns up we shall
never know how active Lamb's pen was at that time. The next belong to
the year 1812—in <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis> (see page 116)—and we then leap
another seven years or so until 1819-1820, Lamb's busiest period as a
caustic critic of affairs—in <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis>, possibly the <emphasis>Morning
Chronicle</emphasis>, and principally in <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>. After 1820, however, he
returned to this vein very seldom, and then with less bitterness and
depth of feeling. "The Royal Wonders," in <emphasis>The Times</emphasis> for August 10,
1830 (see page 122), and "Lines Suggested by a Sight of Waltham Cross,"
in the <emphasis>Englishman's Magazine</emphasis>, September, 1831 (written, however, some
years earlier), on page 121, being his latest efforts that we know of.
Of course there must be many other similar productions to which we have
no clue—the old <emphasis>Morning Post</emphasis> days doubtless saw many an epigram that
cannot now be definitely claimed for Lamb—but those that are preserved
here sufficiently show how feelingly Lamb could hate and how trenchantly
he could chastise. Others that seem to me likely to be Lamb's I could
have included; but it is well to dispense as much as possible with the
problematic. For example, I suspect Lamb of the authorship of several of
the epigrams quoted in <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis> in 1819 and 1820 from the <emphasis>Morning
Chronicle</emphasis>. He used to send verses to the <emphasis>Morning Chronicle</emphasis> at that
time, and Leigh Hunt, the editor of <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis>, would naturally be
pleased to give anything of his friend's an additional publicity.</p>
<p>The majority of the epigrams printed in this section might have remained
unidentified were it not that in 1822 John Thelwall, who owned and
edited <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis> in 1818-1820, issued a little volume entitled <emphasis>The
Poetical Recreations of "The Champion,"</emphasis> wherein Lamb's contributions
were signed R. et R. This signature being appended to certain poems of
which we know Lamb to have been the author—as "The Three Graves," which
he sent also to the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> (in 1825), and which he was in the
habit of reading or reciting to his friends—enables us to ascertain the
authorship of the others. A note placed by Thelwall above the index of
the book states, "it is much to be regretted that, by mere oversight, or
rather mistake, several of the printed epigrams of R. et R. have been
omitted;" but a search through the files of <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis> has failed to
bring to light any others with Lamb's adopted signature.</p>
<p>The origin of the signature R. et R. is unknown. Mr. Percy Fitzgerald
suggests that it might stand for Romulus and Remus, but offers no
supporting theory. He might have added that so unfamiliar a countenance
is in these epigrams shown by their author, that the suggestion of a
wolf rather than a Lamb might have been intended.  Lamb's principal
political epigrams were drawn from him by his intense contempt for the
character of George IV., then Prince of Wales. His treatment of Caroline
of Brunswick, as we see, moved Lamb to utterances of almost sulphurous
indignation not only for the prince himself, but for all who were on his
side, particularly Canning. Lamb, we must suppose, was wholly on the
side of the queen, thus differing from Coleridge, who when asked how his
sympathies were placed would admit only to being anti-Prince.</p>
<p>John Thelwall (1764-1834)—Citizen Thelwall—was one of the most popular
and uncompromising of the Radicals of the seventeen-nineties. He
belonged to the Society of the Friends of the People and other Jacobin
confederacies. In May, 1794, he was even sent to the Tower (with Home
Tooke and Thomas Hardy) for sedition; moved to Newgate in October; and
tried and acquitted in December. Lamb first met him, I fancy, in 1797,
when Thelwall was intimate with Coleridge. After 1798 Thelwall's
political activities were changed for those of a lecturer on more
pacific subjects, and later he opened an institution in London where he
taught elocution and corrected the effects of malformation of the organs
of speech. He bought <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis> in 1818, and held it for two or
three years, but it did not succeed. Thelwall died in 1834. Among his
friends were Coleridge, Haydon, Hazlitt, Southey, Crabb Robinson and
Lamb, all of whom, although they laughed at his excesses and excitements
as a reformer, saw in him an invincible honesty and sincerity.</p>
<p>Before leaving this subject I should like to quote the following
lines from <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis> of November 4 and 5, 1820:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                  A LADY'S SAPPHIC</strong></p>
<p>      Now the calm evening hastily approaches,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Not a sound stirring thro' the gentle woodlands,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Save that soft Zephyr with his downy pinions</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Scatters fresh fragrance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      Now the pale sun-beams in the west declining</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Gild the dew rising as the twilight deepens,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Beauty and splendour decorate the landscape;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Night is approaching.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      By the cool stream's side pensively and sadly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Sit I, while birds sing on the branches sweetly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And my sad thoughts all with their carols soothing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Lull to oblivion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                                  M.L.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A correspondence on English sapphics was carried on in <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>
for some weeks at this time, various efforts being printed. On November
4 appeared the "Lady's Sapphic," just quoted, signed M.S. On the
following day—for <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>, like <emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis>, had a Saturday
and Sunday edition—this signature was changed to M.L., and was thus
given when the verses were reprinted in <emphasis>The Poetical Recreations</emphasis> of
<emphasis>"The Champion"</emphasis> in 1822. There is no evidence that Mary Lamb wrote it;
but she played with verse, and presumably read <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>, since her
brother was writing for it, and the poem might easily be hers.
Personally I like to think it is, and that Lamb, on seeing the mistake
in the initials in the Saturday edition, hurried down to the office to
have it put right in that of Sunday. The same number of <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>
(November 4 and 5, 1820) contains another poem in the same measure
signed C., which not improbably was Lamb's contribution to the pastime.
It runs as follows:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>   DANAE EXPOSED WITH HER INFANT</strong></p>
<p>   <emphasis>An English Sapphic</emphasis></p>
<p>   Dim were the stars, and clouded was the azure, Silence in darkness</p>

   brooded on the ocean, Save when the wave upon the pebbled sea-beach</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   Faintly resounded.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   Then, O forsaken daughter of Acrisius! Seiz'd in the hour of woe and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   tribulation, Thou, with the guiltless victim of thy love, didst Rock on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   the surges.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   Sad o'er the silent bosom of the billow, Borne on the breeze and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   modulated sweetly, Plaintive as music, rose the mother's tones of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   Comfortless anguish.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>   "Sad is thy birth, and stormy is thy cradle, Offspring of sorrow!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   nursling of the ocean! Waves rise around to pillow thee, and night winds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   Lull thee to slumber!"</p>

<p>In a letter to Manning in August, 1801, Lamb quotes this epigram as
having been printed in <emphasis>The Albion</emphasis> and caused that paper's death the
previous week. In his <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on "Newspapers," written thirty years
later, he stated that the epigram was written at the time of
Mackintosh's departure for India to reap the fruits of his apostasy; but
here Lamb's memory deceived him, for Mackintosh was not appointed
Recorder of Bombay until 1803 and did not sail until 1804, whereas there
is reason to believe the date of Lamb's letter to Manning of August,
1801, to be accurate. The epigram must then have referred to a rumour of
some earlier appointment, for Mackintosh had been hoping for something
for several years.</p>
<p>Sir James Mackintosh (1765-1832), the lawyer and philosopher, had in
1791 issued his <emphasis>Vindicia Galliae</emphasis>, a reply to Burke's <emphasis>Reflections on
the French Revolution</emphasis>. Later, however, he became one of Burke's friends
and an opponent of the Revolution, and in 1798 he issued his
Introductory Discourse to his lectures on "The Law of Nature and
Nations," in which the doctrines of his <emphasis>Vindiciae Gallicae</emphasis> were
repudiated. Hence his "apostasy." Mackintosh applied unsuccessfully for
a judgeship in Trinidad, and for the post of Advocate-General in Bengal,
and Lord Wellesley had invited him to become the head of a college in
Calcutta. Rumour may have credited him with any of these posts and thus
have suggested Lamb's epigram. In 1803 he was appointed Recorder of
Bombay. Lamb's dislike of Mackintosh may have been due in some measure
to Coleridge, between whom and Mackintosh a mild feud subsisted. It had
been Mackintosh, however, brother-in-law of Daniel Stuart of the
<emphasis>Morning Post</emphasis>, who introduced Coleridge to that paper. (See notes to
Vol. II., where further particulars of <emphasis>The Albion</emphasis>, edited by Lamb's
friend, John Fenwick, will be found.)</p>
<p>Lamb may or may not have invented the sarcasm in this epigram; but it
was not new. In Mrs. Montagu's letters, some years before, we find
something of the kind concerning Charles James Fox: "His rapid journeys
to England, on the news of the king's illness, have brought on him a
violent complaint in the bowels, which will, it is imagined, prove
mortal. However, if it should, it will vindicate his character from the
general report that he has no bowels, as has been most strenuously
asserted by his creditors."</p>

<p>These epigrams were identified by the late Mr. Dykes Campbell from a
letter of Lamb's to John Rickman, dated Jan. 14, 1802, printed in
Ainger's edition.</p>

<p>

Sidmouth. After being Speaker for eleven years, he became suddenly Prime</p>

<p>C—— and F—— were George Canning (1770-1827) and John Hookham Frere
(1769-1846) of <emphasis>The Anti-Jacobin</emphasis>, against whom Lamb had a grudge on
account of the <emphasis>Anti-Jacobin's</emphasis> treatment of himself and Lloyd (see note
to <emphasis>Blank Verse</emphasis>, page 320). Lamb returned to the attack on Canning
again and again, as the epigrams that follow will show.</p>
<p>The epigram on Count Rumford was not included. We know that it was sent,
from the Rickman letter. The same missive tells us that that on Dr.
Solomon was also written in 1802, but it was not printed till <emphasis>The
Champion</emphasis> took it on July 15 and 16, 1820. Solomon was alive in 1802 and
was therefore a present Empiric. He was a notorious quack doctor, author
of the <emphasis>Guide to Health</emphasis> and the purveyor of a nostrum called Balm of
Gilead. One of Southey's letters (October 14, 1801) contains a
diverting account of this Empiric. I copy one of Solomon's
advertisements from a provincial paper:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                       DR. SOLOMON'S
                  CORDIAL BALM OF GILEAD</strong></p>
<p>    To the young it will afford lasting health, strength and spirits, in
    place of lassitude and debility; and to the aged and infirm it will
    assuredly furnish great relief and comfort by gently and safely
    invigorating the system; it will not give immortality; but if it be
    in the power of medicine to gild the autumn of declining years, and
    calmly and serenely protract the close of life beyond its narrow
    span, this restorative is capable of effecting that grand
    desideratum.</p>
<p>The price was 10s. 6d. a bottle.</p>
<p>Lamb's epigrams were only a few among many printed in the <emphasis>Morning Post</emphasis>

<p>These epigrams have no signature, but the second of them was reprinted
in <emphasis>The Poetical Recreations of "The Champion"</emphasis> (1822) with Lamb's
signature, R. et R., appended, and a note saying that it was written in
the last reign, together with an announcement that it had not appeared
in <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>, but was inserted in that collection at the author's
request. By Princeps and the heir-apparent is meant, of course, the
Prince of Wales, afterwards George IV., who had just entered upon office
as Regent. The epigrams refer to his transfer of confidence, if so it
may be called, from the Whig party to the Marquis Wellesley, Perceval
and the Tory party. The circumstance that the Prince of Wales was also
Duke of Cornwall is referred to in the first epigram. The second of the
epigrams is copied into one of Lamb's Commonplace Books with the title
"On the Prince breaking with his Party."</p>

appeared in <emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>, but was collected with the other pieces by
the author's request.</p>
<p>The subject of the verses was, of course, the first gentleman in Europe.
<emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis> was never over-nice in its treatment of the prince, and
it was in the same year, 1812, that Leigh Hunt, the editor, and his
brother, the printer, of the paper were prosecuted for the article
styling him a "libertine" and the "companion of gamblers and demireps"
(which appeared the week following Lamb's poem), and were condemned to
imprisonment for it. Lamb's lines came very little short of expressing
equally objectionable criticisms; but verse is often privileged.
Thelwall—and Lamb—showed some courage in reprinting the lines in 1822,
when the prince had become king. Talfourd relates that Lamb was in the
habit of checking harsh comments on the prince by others with the
smiling remark, "<emphasis>I</emphasis> love my Regent."</p>
<p>In Galignani's 1828 edition of Byron this piece was attributed to his
lordship.</p>

<p>William Gifford (1756-1826), editor of the <emphasis>Quarterly Review</emphasis>, had been
apprenticed to a cobbler. Lamb had an old score against him on account
of his editorial treatment of Lamb's review of Wordsworth's <emphasis>Excursion</emphasis>,
in 1814, and other matters (see note to "Letter to Southey," Vol. I.).
Writing to the Olliers, on the publication of his <emphasis>Works</emphasis>, June 18,
1818, Lamb says, in reference to this sonnet: "I meditate an attack upon
that Cobler Gifford, which shall appear immediately after any favourable
mention which S. [Southey] may make in the Quarterly. It can't in decent
<emphasis>gratitude</emphasis> appear <emphasis>before</emphasis>." When the sonnet was printed in the
<emphasis>Examiner</emphasis> it purported to have reference to the <emphasis>Quarterly's</emphasis> treatment
of Shelley's <emphasis>Revolt of Islam</emphasis>, which treatment Leigh Hunt was then
exposing in a series of articles.</p>

<p>Another contribution to the character of George IV., who had just
succeeded to the throne, and was at that moment engaged upon the task of
divorcing his wife, Caroline of Brunswick. The eighth line must be read
probably with a medical eye. The concluding three lines refer to George
III.'s insanity. As a political satirist Lamb disdained half measures.</p>

Reprinted in the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis>, May, 1825, unsigned, with the names
in the last line printed only with initials and dashes, and the
sub-title, "Written during the time, now happily almost forgotten, of
the spy system."</p>
<p>Lamb probably found a certain mischievous pleasure in giving these lines
the title of one of Coleridge's early poems.</p>
<p>The spy system was a protective movement undertaken by Lord Sidmouth
(1757-1844) as Home Secretary in 1817—after the Luddite riots, the
general disaffection in the country, Thistlewood's Spa Fields uprising
and the break-down of the prosecution. Curious reading on the subject is
to be found in the memoirs of Richmond the Spy, and Peter Mackenzie's
remarks on that book and its author, in <emphasis>Tait's Magazine</emphasis>. The spy
system culminated with the failure of the Cato Street Conspiracy in
1820, which cost Thistlewood his life. That plot to murder ministers was
revealed by George Edwards, one of the spies named by Lamb in the last
line of this poem. Castles and Oliver were other government spies
mentioned by Richmond.</p>
<p>Line 2. <emphasis>Bedloe, Oates</emphasis> … William Bedloe (1650-1680) and Titus Oates
(1649-1705) were associated as lying informers of the proceedings of the

<p><emphasis>The Champion</emphasis>, May 13 and 14, 1820. Reprinted in <emphasis>The Poetical

<p>Matthew Wood, afterwards Sir Matthew (1768-1843), was twice Lord Mayor
of London, 1815-1817, and M.P. for the city. He was one of the principal
friends and advisers of Caroline of Brunswick, George IV.'s repudiated
wife. Hence his particular merit in Lamb's eyes. Later he administered
the affairs of the Duke of Kent, whose trustee he was, and his baronetcy
was the first bestowed by Queen Victoria. The sonnet contains another of
Lamb's attacks on Canning. This statesman's mother, after the death of
George Canning, her first husband, in 1771, took to the stage, where she
remained for thirty years. Canning was at school at Eton. The course on
which Wood was adjured to hold was the defence of Queen Caroline; but
Canning's opposition to her cause was not so absolute as Lamb seemed to
think. The ministry, of which Canning was a member, had prepared a bill
by which the queen was to receive £50,000 annually so long as she
remained abroad. The king insisted on divorce or nothing, and it was his
own repugnance to this measure that caused Canning to tender his
resignation. The king refused it, and Canning went abroad and did not
return until it was abandoned.</p>
<p>Line 11. <emphasis>Pickpocket Peer</emphasis>. This would be Henry Dundas, Viscount
Melville (1742-1811), Pitt's lieutenant, who was impeached for
embezzling money as First Lord of the Admiralty. He was acquitted, but
that was a circumstance that would hardly concern Lamb when in this
mood.</p>

returned to England in June, 1820, staying with Alderman Wood (see page

divorce proceedings began, but were eventually withdrawn. Caroline made
a forcible effort to be present at the Coronation, on July 29, 1821, but
was repulsed at the Abbey door. She was taken ill the next day and died

<p>From a MS. book of William Ayrton's. In <emphasis>The New Times</emphasis>, October 24,
1825, the verses followed the "Ode to the Treadmill." The epigram, which
was unsigned, then ran thus:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                THE POETICAL CASK</strong></p>
<p>      With change of climate manners alter not:</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>Lord Byron's body had been brought home from Greece, for burial at
Hucknall Torkard, in 1824, and the cause of the epigram was a paragraph
in <emphasis>The New Times</emphasis> of October 19, 1825, stating that the tub in which
Byron's remains came home was exhibited by the captain of the <emphasis>Rodney</emphasis>
for 2s. 6d. a head; afterwards sold to a cooper in Whitechapel; resold
to a museum; and finally sold again to a cooper in Middle New Street,

<p>These epigrams were written for the sons of James Augustus Hessey, the
publisher, two Merchant Taylor boys. In <emphasis>The Taylorian</emphasis> for March, 1884,
the magazine of the Merchant Taylors' School, the late Archdeacon
Hessey, one of the boys in question, told the story of their authorship.
It was a custom many years ago for Election Day at Merchant Taylors'
School to be marked by the recitation of original epigrams in Greek,
Latin and English, which, although the boys themselves were usually the
authors, might also be the work of other hands. Archdeacon Hessey and
his brother, as the following passage explains, resorted to Charles Lamb
for assistance:—</p>
<p>The subjects for 1830 were <emphasis>Suum Cuique</emphasis> and <emphasis>Brevis esse latoro</emphasis>.
After some three or four exercise nights I confess that I was literally
"at my wits' end." But a brilliant idea struck me. I had frequently, boy
as I was, seen Charles Lamb (Elia) at my father's house, and once, in
1825 or 1826, I had been taken to have tea with him and his sister, Mary
Lamb, at their little house, Colebrook Cottage, a whitish-brown
tenement, standing by itself, close to the New River, at Islington. He
was very kind, as he always was to young people, and very quaint. I told
him that I had devoured his "Roast Pig;" he congratulated me on
possessing a thorough schoolboy's appetite. And he was pleased when I
mentioned my having seen the boys at Christ's Hospital at their public
suppers, which then took place on the Sunday evenings in Lent. "Could
this good-natured and humorous old gentleman be prevailed upon to give
me an Epigram?" "I don't know," said my father, to whom I put the
question, "but I will ask him at any rate, and send him the mottoes." In
a day or two there arrived from Enfield, to which Lamb had removed some
time in 1827, not one, but two epigrams, one on each subject. That on
<emphasis>Suum Cuique</emphasis> was in Latin, and was suggested by the grim satisfaction
which had recently been expressed by the public at the capture and
execution of some notorious highwayman. That on <emphasis>Brevis esse laboro</emphasis> was
in English, and might have represented an adventure which had befallen
Lamb himself, for he stammered frequently, though he was not so grievous
a <emphasis>Balbulus</emphasis> as his friend George Darley, whom I had also often seen. I
need scarcely say that the two Epigrams were highly appreciated, and
that my brother and myself, for I gave my brother one of them, were
objects of envy to our schoolfellows.</p>
<p>The death of George IV., however, prevented their being recited on the
occasion for which they were written.</p>
<p>"<emphasis>Suum Cuique</emphasis>," which was signed F. Hessey, was thus translated by its
presumptive author:—</p>
<p>      A thief, on dreary Bagshot's heath well known,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Was fond of making others' goods his own;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      <emphasis>Meum</emphasis> was never thought of, nor was <emphasis>Tuum</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      But everything with him was counted <emphasis>Suum</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      At length each gets his own, and no one grieves;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

      His body to dissecting knife has gone;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Himself to Orcus: well—each gets his own.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The English epigram, which was signed J.A. Hessey, was a rhyming version
of a story which Lamb was fond of telling. Three, at least, of his
friends relate the story in their recollections of him: Mrs. Mathews in
her life of her husband; Leigh Hunt in <emphasis>The Companion</emphasis>; and De Quincey
in <emphasis>Fraser's Magazine</emphasis>. The incident possibly occurred to Lamb when as a
boy—or little more—he stayed at Margate about 1790. Lamb must have
written Merchant Taylors' epigrams before, for in 1803, in a letter to
Godwin about writing to order, he speaks of having undertaken, three or
four times, a schoolboy copy of verses for Merchant Taylors' boys at a
guinea a copy, and refers to the trouble and vexation the work was to
him.</p>
<p>Writing to Southey on May 10, 1830, Lamb said, at the end:—"Perhaps
an epigram (not a very happy-gram) I did for a school-boy yesterday may
amuse. I pray Jove he may not get a flogging for any false quantity; but
'tis, with one exception, the only Latin verses I have made for forty
years, and I did it 'to order.'</p>

<p>Page 123. <emphasis>On "The Literary Gazette"</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis>, August 22, 1830. This epigram, consisting only of the
first four lines, slightly altered, and headed "Rejected Epigrams,
6"-evidently torn from a paper containing a number of verses (the figure
7 is just visible underneath it)—is in the British Museum among the
letters left by Vincent Novello. It is inscribed, "In handwriting of Mr.
Charles Lamb." The same collection contains a copy, in Mrs. Cowden
Clarke's handwriting, of the sonnet to Mrs. Jane Towers (see page 50).
<emphasis>The Literary Gazette</emphasis> was William Jerdan's paper, a poor thing, which
Lamb had reason to dislike for the attack it made upon him when <emphasis>Album
Verses</emphasis> was published (see note on page 331).</p>
<p><emphasis>The Examiner</emphasis> began the attack on August 14, 1830. All the epigrams are
signed T.A. This means that if Lamb wrote the above, he wrote all; which
is not, I think, likely. I do not reproduce them, the humour of punning
upon the name of the editor of the <emphasis>Literary Gazette</emphasis> being a little
outmoded.</p>
<p>T.A. may, of course, have been Lamb's pseudonymous signature. If so, he
may have chosen it as a joke upon his friend Thomas Allsop. But since
one of the epigrams is addressed to himself I doubt if Lamb was the
author.</p>

<p>Page 123. <emphasis>On the Fast-Day</emphasis>.</p>
<p>John Payne Collier, in his privately printed reminiscences, <emphasis>An Old

been written for the Fast-Day on October 19, 1803, for that on May 25,
1804, or for a later one. Lamb tells Hazlitt in February, 1806, that he
meditates a stroll on the Fast-Day.</p>

<p>Mr. W. Carew Hazlitt, in <emphasis>Mary and Charles Lamb</emphasis>, 1874, says: "I found
these lines—a parody on the popular, or nursery, ditty, 'Lady-bird,
lady-bird, fly away home'—officiating as a wrapper to some of Mr.
Hazlitt's hair. There is no signature; but the handwriting is
unmistakably Lamb's; nor are the lines themselves the worst of his
playful effusions." The piece suggests that Lamb, in a wild mood, was
turning his own "Angel Help" (see page 51) into ridicule—possibly to
satisfy some one who dared him to do it, or vowed that such a feat could
not be accomplished.</p>

<p>Writing to Southey on March 20, 1799, Lamb says:—"I the other day
threw off an extempore epitaph on Ensign Peacock of the 3rd Regt. of the
Royal East India Volunteers, who like other boys in this scarlet tainted
age was ambitious of playing at soldiers, but dying in the first flash
of his valour was at the particular instance of his relations buried
with military honours! like any veteran scarr'd or chopt from Blenheim
or Ramilies. (He was buried in sash and gorget.) Sed hae sunt
lamentabilis nugae—But'tis as good as some epitaphs you and I have read
together in Christ-Church-yard."</p>
<p>The last five Epigrams were sent to the <emphasis>New York Tribune</emphasis>, Feb. 22,
1879, by the late J.H. Siddons. They were found on scraps of paper in
Lamb's desk in the India House. Wagstaff and Sturms were fellow-clerks.
Dr. Drake was the medical officer of the establishment. Captain Dey was
a putative son of George IV. The lines upon him were given to Siddons by

<p>Page 127. SATAN IN SEARCH OF A WIFE, 1831.</p>
<p>This ballad was published by Moxon, anonymously, in 1831, although the
authorship was no secret In its volume form it was illustrated by George
Cruikshank. Lamb probably did not value his ballad very highly. Writing
to Moxon in 1833 he says, "I wish you would omit 'by the Author of Elia'
now, in advertising that damn'd 'Devil's Wedding.'"</p>
<p>There is a reference to the poem, in Lamb's letter to Moxon of
October 24, 1831, which needs explanation. Moxon's <emphasis>Englishman's
Magazine</emphasis>, after running under his control for three months,
was suddenly abandoned. Lamb, who seems to have been paid in
advance for his work, wrote to Moxon on the subject, approving him
for getting the weight off his mind and adding:—"I have one on
mine. The cash in hand which as ***** less truly says,
burns in my pocket. I feel queer at returning it (who does not?).
You feel awkward at re-taking it (who ought not?) is there no
middle way of adjusting this fine embarrassment. I think I
have hit upon a medium to skin the sore place over, if not quite
to heal it. You hinted that there might be something under £10
by and by accruing to me <emphasis>Devil's Money</emphasis>. You are sanguine—say
£7 10s.—that I entirely renounce and abjure all future interest
in, I insist upon it, and 'by Him I will not name' I won't touch a
penny of it. That will split your loss one half—and leave me
conscientious possessor of what I hold. Less than your assent to
this, no proposal will I accept of."</p>
<p>A few months later, writing again to Moxon, he says:—"I am heartily
sorry my Devil does not answer. We must try it a little longer; and,
after all, I think I must insist on taking a portion of its loss upon
myself. It is too much that you should lose by two adventures."</p>
<p>According to some reminiscences of Lamb by Mr. J. Fuller Russell,
printed in <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>, April 1, 1882, Lamb suppressed "Satan in
Search of a Wife," for the reason that the Vicar of Enfield, Dr.
Cresswell, also had married a tailor's daughter, and might be hurt by
the ballad. The correspondence quoted above does not, I think, bear out
Mr. Russell's statement. If the book were still being advertised in
1833, we can hardly believe that any consideration for the Vicar of
Enfield would cause its suppression. This gentleman had been at Enfield
for several years, and Lamb would have either suppressed the book
immediately or not at all; but possibly his wish to disassociate the
name of Elia from the work was inspired by the coincidence.</p>
<p>The ballad does not call for much annotation. The legend
mentioned in the dedication tells how Cecilia, by her music, drew
an angel from heaven, who brought her roses of Paradise. The
ballad of King Cophetua and the beggar maid may be read in the
<emphasis>Percy Reliques</emphasis>. Hecate is a triple deity, known as Luna in heaven,
Diana on earth, and Proserpine in hell. In the reference to Milton
I think Lamb must have been thinking of the lines, <emphasis>Paradise Lost</emphasis>,
I., 27-28:—</p>
<p>      Say first, for Heav'n hides nothing from thy view,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Nor the deep tract of Hell….</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>or, <emphasis>Paradise Lost</emphasis>, V., 542:—</p>

<p>Alecto (Part I., Stanza II.) was one of the Furies.—Old Parr (Stanza
IV.) lived to be 152; he died in 1635.—Semiramis (Stanza XVII.) was
Queen of Assyria, under whom Babylon became the most wonderful city in
the world; Helen was Helen of Troy, the cause of the war between the
Greeks and Trojans; Medea was the cruel lover of Jason, who recovered
the Golden Fleece.—Clytemnestra (Stanza XVIII.) was the wife and
murderer of Agamemnon; Joan of Naples was Giovanna, the wife of Andrea
of Hungary, who was accused of assassinating him. Landor wrote a play,
"Giovanna of Naples," to "restore her fame" and "requite her wrongs;"
Cleopatra was the Queen of Egypt, and lover of Mark Antony; Jocasta
married her son Oedipus unknowing who he was.—A tailor's "goose"
(Stanza XXII.) is his smoothing-iron, and his "hell" (Stanza XXIII.) the
place where he throws his shreds and debris.—Lamb's own "Vision of
Horns" (see Vol. I.) serves as a commentary on Stanza XXVII.; and in his
essay "On the Melancholy of Tailors" (Vol. I.) are further remarks on
the connection between tailors and cabbage in Stanza I. of Part II.—The
two Miss Crockfords of Stanza XVIII. would be the daughters of William
Crockford, of Crockford's Club, who, after succeeding to his father's
business of fishmonger, opened the gaming-house which bore his name and
amassed a fortune of upwards of a million.—Semele (Stanza XXI.), whose
lightest wish Jupiter had sworn to grant, was treacherously induced to
express the desire that Jupiter would visit her with the divine pomp in
which he approached his lawful wife Juno. He did so, and she was
consumed by his lightning and thunderbolts.—The bard of Stanza XXV. is,
of course, Virgil.</p>

<p>Had Lamb not sent this epilogue to Manning in the letter of December 13,
1800, we should have no copy of it; for Godwin, by Lamb's advice, did
not print it with the play. Writing to Godwin two days before, Lamb
remarked:-"I have been plotting how to abridge the Epilogue. But I
cannot see that any lines can be spared, retaining the connection,
except these two, which are better out:</p>
<p>      "Why should I instance, &amp;c.,</p>

<p>Godwin's "Antonio," produced at Drury Lane on December 13, 1800, was a
failure. Many years afterwards Lamb told the story of the unlucky first
night (see "The Old Actors" in Appendix to Vol. II. of this edition).

<p>William Godwin's tragedy "Faulkener" was produced at Drury Lane,
December 16, 1807, with some success. Lamb's letters to Godwin of
September 9 and 17, 1801, suggest that he had a share in the framing of
the plot. Later the play was taken in hand by Thomas Holcroft and made
more dramatic.</p>
<p>According to Godwin's preface, 1807, the story was taken from the 1745
edition of Defoe's <emphasis>Roxana</emphasis>, which contains the episode of Susannah
imagining herself to be Roxana's daughter and throwing herself in her
mother's way. Godwin transformed the daughter into a son. Lamb, however,
seems to have believed this episode to be in the first edition, 1724,
and afterwards to have been removed at the entreaty of Southerne,
Defoe's friend (see Lamb's letters to Walter Wilson, Defoe's biographer,
of December 16, 1822, and February 24, 1823). But it is in reality the
first edition which lacks the episode, and Mr. G.A. Aitken, Defoe's
latest editor, doubts Southerne's interference altogether and considers
Susannah's curiosity an alien interpolation. For Lamb's other remarks on
Defoe see also the "Ode to the Tread Mill," page 72 of this volume, and
"Estimate of Defoe's Secondary Novels" (Vol. I.). Writing to Walter
Wilson on November 15, 1829, on the receipt of his memoirs of Defoe,
Lamb exclaims: "De Foe was always my darling."</p>

<p>A play by Henry Siddons (1774-1815), Mrs. Siddons' eldest son. It was

however, received so badly that on the second night another was

<p>Page 142. <emphasis>Prologue to "Remorse."</emphasis></p>
<p>Coleridge's tragedy "Remorse," a recasting of his "Osorio" (written at
Sheridan's instigation in 1797), was produced with success on January
23, 1813; and was printed, with the prologue, in the same year. Lamb's
prologue, "spoken by Mr. Carr," was (according to Mr. Dykes Campbell) a
recasting of some verses composed for the prize offered by the Drury
Lane Committee in the previous year, 1812, in response to their
advertisement for a suitable poem to be read at the reopening of the new
building after the fire of 1809. It was, of course, this competition
which brought forth the <emphasis>Rejected Addresses</emphasis> (1812) of the brothers
James and Horace Smith.</p>
<p>The prologue as printed is very different from that which was spoken at
the theatre by Mr. Carr. A writer in the <emphasis>Theatrical Inquisitor</emphasis> for
February, 1813, in his contemptuous criticism, refers to several
passages that are no longer extant. I quote from an account of the
matter by the late Mr. Dykes Campbell in the <emphasis>Illustrated London News</emphasis>,
October 22, 1892:—</p>
<p>I am afraid the true text of Lamb's "Rejected Address," even as
modified for use as a prologue, has not come down to us. This is how the
severe and suspicious <emphasis>Inquisitor</emphasis> describes it and its twin brother the
epilogue—</p>
<p>The Prologue and Epilogue were among the most stupid productions of the
modern muse; the former was, in all probability, a Rejected Address, for
it contained many eulogiums on the beauty and magnificence of the "dome"
of Drury; talked of the waves being not quite dry, and expressed the
happiness of the bard at being the first whose muse had soared within
its limits. More stupid than the doggerel of Twiss, and more affected
than the pretty verses of Miles Peter Andrews, the Epilogue proclaimed
its author and the writer of the Prologue to be par nobile fratrum, in
rival dulness both pre-eminent.</p>
<p>The reader of Lamb's prologue will find little of all this in it, but
there is no reason for doubting the critic's account of what he heard at
the theatre. It is not at all unlikely that it was this paragraph which
suggested to Lamb the advisability of still further revising the
"Rejected Address." In the prologue there is a good deal about the size
of the theatre, as compared with "the Lyceum's petty sphere," and of how
pleased Shakspere would have been had he been able to hear—</p>
<p>      When that dread curse of Lear's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Had burst tremendous on a thousand ears:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>rather an anti-climax, by the way, for it means an audience of but five
hundred, which would have been a beggarly account for the new Drury.
There is nothing either about its "dome," or about the scenery, except
commonplaces so flat that one doubts if it be quite fair to quote them—</p>
<p>      The very use, since so essential grown,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Of painted scenes, was to his [Shakspere's] stage unknown.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This is not an improvement on the "waves not yet quite dry," a Lamb-like
touch which could not have been invented by the critic, and may go far
to convince us of his veracity.</p>
<p>Above all, there is no trace of that splendidly audacious suggestion
that Coleridge was the first "whose muse had soared" within the new
dome—unless we find a blind one in the closing lines, supposing them to
have been converted by the simple process of inversion. Instead of
Coleridge being the first whose muse had soared in the new Drury, Drury
was the first place in which his dramatic muse had soared.</p>
<p>Lamb was not among the writers parodied by the "sneering brothers" (as
he called them later), but Coleridge was. Lamb's turn came in 1825, when
P.G. Patmore, afterwards his friend and the father of Coventry Patmore,
wrote <emphasis>Rejected Articles</emphasis>, in which was a very poor imitation of Elia.</p>
<p>Line 9. <emphasis>Betterton or Booth.</emphasis> Thomas Betterton, born probably in 1635,
acted for the last time in 1710, the year in which he died. Barton Booth
(1681-1733) left the stage in 1728. Betterton was much at the Little
Theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields; also at Sir John Vanbrugh's theatre in
the Haymarket.</p>
<p>Line 11. <emphasis>Quin</emphasis>. James Quin (1693-1766) of Drury Lane and Covent
Garden, Garrick's great rival, famous as Falstaff. His last appearance
was in 1753.</p>
<p>Line 12. <emphasis>Garrick.</emphasis> Garrick's Drury Lane, in which Lamb saw his first
play, was that built by Sir Christopher Wren in 1674. It lasted, with
certain alterations, including a new face by the brothers Adam, nearly
120 years. The seating capacity of this theatre was modest. In 1794 a
new Drury Lane Theatre, the third, was opened—too large for comfortable
seeing or hearing. This was burned down in 1809; and the new one, the
fourth, and that in which "Remorse" was produced, was opened in 1812.
This is the building (with certain additions) that still stands.</p>

same idea in connection with Elliston (see "To the Shade of Elliston,"

(1579-1625), Beaumont's collaborator. Ben Jonson's "Every Man in His
Humour" was produced at the Globe in 1598, Shakspeare being in the
caste; but in the main he wrote for Henslowe, who was connected with the
Rose and the Swan, on Bankside, and with the theatre in Newington Butts,
and who built, with Alleyn, in 1600, the Fortune in Golden Lane,
Cripplegate Without. Beaumont and Fletcher's plays went for the most
part to Burbage, who owned the Globe at Southwark and the Blackfriars'
Theatre. Shakspeare also wrote for Burbage.</p>

<p>This epilogue, says Canon Ainger, who first printed it, was written for
a performance given by the family of Barren Field in 1824. The family of
Henry Field, Barron's father, would perhaps be more accurate; for Barron
Field was childless. The verses, which I print by permission of Miss
Kendall, Miss Field's residuary legatee, were given to Canon Ainger by
the late Miss M.L. Field, of Hastings. In his interesting note he adds
of this lady (to whom Lamb addressed the verses on page 106), "she told
me that she (then a girl of 19) sat by the side of Lamb during the
performance. She remembered well, she said, that in course of the play a
looking glass was broken, and that Lamb turned to her and whispered
'Sixpence!' She added that before the play began, while the guests were
assembling, the butler announced 'Mr. Negus!'—upon which Lamb
exclaimed, 'Hand him round!'"</p>
<p>Lamb refers in the opening lines to Edmund Kean and John Philip Kemble.</p>
<p>In this connection it may be interesting to state that Lamb told Patmore
that he considered John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster, the grandest
name in the world.</p>

<p>The original form of the prologue to James Sheridan Knowles' comedy, not

Moxon, for Knowles, in April, 1833, and differs considerably. See the
large edition of this work. It is curious that the prologue was not
attributed to Lamb when the play was printed. Knowles wrote in the
preface: "To my early, my trusty and honoured friend, Charles Lamb, I
owe my thanks for a delightful Epilogue, composed almost as soon as it
was requested. To an equally dear friend, I am equally indebted for my
Prologue."</p>

<p>Page 149. JOHN WOODVIL.</p>
<p>First published in 1802 in a slender volume entitled <emphasis>John Woodvil: a
Tragedy. By C. Lamb. To which are added Fragments of Burton, the author
of the Anatomy of Melancholy.</emphasis> The full contents of the book were:—</p>
<p>John Woodvil; Ballad, From the German (see page 29); Helen (see page
28); Curious Fragments, I., II., III., IV.; The Argument; The
Consequence (see Vol. I., page 29, and note; also pages 30 and 35 of the
present volume and notes).</p>
<p><emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis> was reprinted by Lamb in the <emphasis>Works</emphasis>, 1818, the text of
which is followed here.</p>
<p>If Mr. Fuller Russell was right in his statement in <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>,
April 1, 1882, that Lamb told him he "had lost £25 by his best effort,
<emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>," we must suppose that the book was published wholly or
partially at his own cost.</p>
<p>The history of the poem which follows is, with an omission and addition
here and there, that compiled by the late Mr. Dykes Campbell and
contributed by him to <emphasis>The Athenaeum</emphasis>, October 31 and November 14, 1891.
Mr. Campbell had the opportunity of collating the edition of 1802 with a
manuscript copy made by Lamb and his sister for Manning. With that
patient thoroughness and discrimination which made his work as an
editor so valuable, Mr. Campbell minutely examined this copy and put the
results on record; and they are now for the first time, by permission of
Mrs. Dykes Campbell and the Editor of <emphasis>The Athenaum</emphasis>, incorporated in an
edition of Lamb's writings. The copy itself, I may add, when it came
into the market, was secured by an American collector. Mr. Campbell's
words follow, my own interpolations being within square brackets.</p>
<p>Lamb's first allusion to the future <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis> occurs in a letter to
Southey (October 29, 1798), at a time when the two young men were
exchanging a good many copies of verses for mutual criticism. "Not
having anything of my own," writes Lamb, "to send you in return (though,
to tell the truth, I am at work upon something which if I were to cut
away and garble, perhaps I might send you an extract or two that might
not displease you: but I will not do that; and whether it will come to
anything I know not, for I am as slow as a Fleming painter, when I
compose anything) I will crave leave to put down a few lines of old
Christopher Marlowe's." Lamb must soon have got rid of his objections to
cutting away and garbling, for before a month had elapsed he had sent
Southey two extracts, first the "Dying Lover" [see "Dramatic Fragment,"
page 85], and next (November 28) "The Witch" [see page 199], both of
which passages were excluded from the printed play. [The letter, which
is wrongly dated April 20, 1799, in some editions, concludes (of "The
Witch"): "This is the extract I bragged of as superior to that I sent
you from Marlowe: perhaps you will smile."]</p>
<p>Charles Lloyd shared with Southey the pains and pleasures of criticising
Lamb's verses, for Lamb asks the latter if he agrees with Lloyd in
disliking something in "The Witch."</p>
<p>[Thus: "Lloyd objects to 'shutting up the womb of his purse' in my curse
(which, for a Christian witch in a Christian country, is not too mild, I
hope). Do you object? I think there is a strangeness in the idea, as
well as 'shaking the poor little snakes from his door,' which suits the
speaker. Witches illustrate, as fine ladies do, from their own familiar
objects, and snakes and the shutting up of wombs are in their way. I
don't know that this last charge has been before brought against 'em nor
either the sour milk or the mandrake babe; but I affirm these be things
a witch would do if she could."]</p>
<p>Lamb proposes also to adopt an emendation of Southey's in the "Dying
Lover"—"though I do not feel the objection against 'Silent Prayer,'"
and in the event he did very sensibly stick to his own opinion, for in
the <emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> the line runs, as first written:—</p>
<p>      He put a silent prayer up for the bride.</p>
<p>One wonders what harm Southey can have seen in it. At this time Southey
was collecting verses for the first volume of his <emphasis>Annual Anthology</emphasis>
(provisionally called the <emphasis>Kalendar</emphasis>), and inviting contributions from
Lamb. In writing before November 28, 1798, "This ['The Witch'] and the
'Dying Lover' I gave you are the only extracts I can give without
mutilation," Lamb may have meant that Southey was at liberty to print
them in the <emphasis>Anthology</emphasis>. A year later, October 31, 1799, when the second
volume was in preparation, Lamb wrote:—"I shall have nothing to
communicate, I fear, to the <emphasis>Anthology</emphasis>. You shall have some fragments
of my play if you desire them; but I think I would rather print it
whole."</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, Lamb contributed nothing to the collection except
the lines "Living without God in the World," printed in the first volume
[see page 19. To <emphasis>Recreations in Agriculture, Natural History,</emphasis> etc.,
1801, edited by Dr. James Anderson, a friend of George Dyer, Lamb,
however, sent "Description of a Forest Life," "The General Lover" (What
is it you love?) and the "Dying Lover," called "Fragment in Dialogue."
There are slight differences in the text, the chief alteration being in
line 3 of the "Description of a Forest Life":—</p>
<p>      Bursting the lubbar bonds of sleep that bound him.]</p>
<p>Reverting to the letter of November 28, one learns Lamb's intentions as
to the play:—"My Tragedy will be a medley (as I intend it to be a
medley) of laughter and tears, prose and verse, and in some places
rhyme, songs, wit, pathos, humour, and, if possible, sublimity; at least
it is not a fault in my intention if it does not comprehend most of
these discordant atoms. Heaven send they dance not the 'Dance of
Death'!"</p>
<p>The composition went on slowly and in a very casual way, for on January
21, 1799, he writes again to Southey:—"I have only one slight passage
to send you, scarce worth the sending, which I want to edge in somewhere
into my play, which, by the way, hath not received the addition often
lines, besides, since I saw you." The "slight passage" is one which, it
will be seen, was "edged in" near the end of the second act, but taken
out again—that beginning:—</p>
<p>      I saw him [John Woodvil] in the day of Worcester fight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Whither he came at twice seven years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Under the discipline of the Lord Falkland</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (His uncle by the mother's side), etc.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Lamb naïvely asks Southey, "But did Falkland die before the Worcester
fight? In that case I must make bold to unclify some other nobleman." I
suppose Southey must have answered that Falkland had been killed at
Newbury eight years before Worcester fight, for when the passage had
been edged into the play, <emphasis>Naseby</emphasis> and <emphasis>Ashley</emphasis> were substituted for
"Worcester" and "Falkland" respectively. This was as bad a shot as the
first, for Sir Anthony Cooper, whether at Naseby or no, did not become
Lord Ashley until sixteen years after that fight[31]. Had the passage
escaped the pruning knife, Lamb's historical research would no doubt
have provided a proper battle and a proper uncle for his hero. Again
Lloyd appears as a critic, and this time he is obeyed, probably because
his objection to "portrayed in his face" was backed by Southey. "I like
the line," says Lamb, but he altered it to</p>
<p>      Of Valour's beauty in his youthful face</p>
<p>in the Manning MS. Four months later, on May 20, Lamb sends Southey the
charming passage about forest-life on page 173, and defends his blank
verse against Southey's censure of the pauses at the end of the lines;
he does it on the model of Shakespeare, he says, in his "endeavour after
a colloquial ease and spirit." Talfourd printed the passage in full, but
some later editors have cut down the twenty-four lines to the six
opening ones, to the loss of a point in the letter. Lamb says he "loves
to anticipate charges of unoriginality," adding—"the first line is
almost Shakespeare's:—</p>
<p>      "To have my love to bed and to arise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                          "'Midsummer-Night's Dream.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I think there is a sweetness in the versification not unlike some rhymes
in that exquisite play, and the last line but three is yours." This line
describes how the deer, as they came tripping by,</p>
<p>      Then stop and gaze, then turn, they know not why.</p>
<p>Lamb thus gives the line and his reference:—</p>
<p>                                         ——An eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That met the gaze, or turn'd it knew not why.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                    "Rosamund's Epistle."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But, of course, he misquotes both line and title—though Southey would
feel flattered in finding that his friend's memory had done so well. As
the editors have not annotated the passage, I will say here that Lamb
should have quoted</p>
<p>                                         The modest eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      That met the glance, or turn'd, it knew not why.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                        "Rosamund to Henry."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The poem is one of those in the now scarce volume which Southey and
Lovel published jointly at Bath in 1795, <emphasis>Poems: containing "The
Retrospect."</emphasis> [It was this forest passage which, as Hazlitt tells us in
his <emphasis>Spirit of the Age</emphasis>, so puzzled Godwin. After looking in vain
through the old dramatists for it, he applied to Lamb himself.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 31: Sir Jacob Astley(?), but he too was ennobled <emphasis>after</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Naseby.]</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>By the end of October the play had evidently been completed (though not
yet named), for on the 31st Southey was asked, "Have you seen it, or
shall I lend you a copy? I want your opinion of it." None is recorded
here, but more than two years later, when Southey was in London, he gave
it to Danvers (<emphasis>Letters of R.S.</emphasis>, II., 184): "Lamb and his sister see us
often: he is printing his play, which will please you by the exquisite
beauty of its poetry, and provoke you by the exquisite silliness of its
story."</p>
<p>The play must have been baptised as "Pride's Cure" soon after
Hallowe'en, for at Christmas it was submitted under that title to
Kemble, and about the same time (December 28, 1799) we find Lamb
defending the title (with the vehemence and subtlety of a doubter, as I
read) against the adverse criticism of Manning and Mrs. Charles Lloyd.
Lamb had lately been on a visit to these friends at Cambridge, and had
doubtless taken a copy of his play with him and received their
objections there and then—for his defence does not seem to have been
provoked by a letter. [In a letter to Charles Lloyd that has come to
light since Mr. Dykes Campbell wrote, belonging to middle December,
1799, Lamb asks for his play to be returned to him, suggesting that Mrs.
Lloyd shall despatch it. It was probably in the letter that accompanied
the parcel that the criticism of the title was found. Lamb thus defended
it:—"By-the-bye, I think you and Sophia both incorrect with regard to
the <emphasis>title</emphasis> of the <emphasis>play</emphasis>. Allowing your objection (which is not
necessary, as pride may be, and is in real life often, cured by
misfortunes not directly originating from its own acts, as Jeremy Taylor
will tell you a naughty desire is sometimes sent to cure it; I know you
read these <emphasis>practical divines</emphasis>)—but allowing your objection, does not
the betraying of his father's secret directly spring from pride?—from
the pride of wine, and a full heart, and a proud over-stepping of the
ordinary rules of morality, and contempt of the prejudices of mankind,
which are not to bind superior souls—'as <emphasis>trust</emphasis> in <emphasis>the matter of
secrets</emphasis> all <emphasis>ties</emphasis> of <emphasis>blood</emphasis>, etc., etc., keeping of <emphasis>promises</emphasis>, the
feeble mind's religion, binding our <emphasis>morning knowledge</emphasis> to the
performance of what <emphasis>last night's ignorance spake</emphasis>'—does he not prate,
that '<emphasis>Great Spirits</emphasis>' must do more than die for their friend? Does not
the pride of wine incite him to display some evidence of friendship,
which its own irregularity shall make great? This I know, that I meant
his punishment not alone to be a cure for his daily and habitual
<emphasis>pride</emphasis>, but the direct consequence and appropriate punishment of a
particular act of pride.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>"If you do not understand it so, it is my fault in not explaining my
meaning."]</p>
<p>Manning seems to have begged for a copy—or reconsideration,
perhaps—for Lamb, on February 13, 1800, promised him a copy "of my play
and the <emphasis>Falstaff Letters</emphasis> in a day or two." There is no trace of the
former having been sent, but the latter certainly was, for on March 1 he
presses Manning for his opinion of it—hopes he is "prepared to call it
a bundle of the sharpest, queerest, profoundest humours," etc., as he
was accustomed to hope when that book was in question. The next mention
of the play occurs in an undated letter to Coleridge [accompanying a MS.
copy of the play for the Wordsworths], dated by Talfourd and other
editors "end of 1800," which must have been written in March or April,
1800 [since Coleridge was then staying with Wordsworth, engaged in
completing the translation of <emphasis>Wallenstein,</emphasis> the last of the MS. being
sent to the printer in April]. Talfourd's mistake in dating it perhaps
led him to suppose that the copy sent through Coleridge to Wordsworth
was a printed copy, and that Lamb had printed <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis> a year
before he published it. If any other proof were needed that Talfourd
guessed wrongly, it is supplied by this sentence in the letter to
Manning of February 15, 1801:—"I lately received from Wordsworth a copy
of the second volume [of the <emphasis>Lyrical Ballads</emphasis>] accompanied by an
acknowledgment of having received from me <emphasis>many months since</emphasis> a copy of
a certain Tragedy, with excuses for not having made any acknowledgment
sooner."</p>
<p>Lamb's reply to Wordsworth (January 30, 1801) is so very dry—"Thank you
for Liking my Play!!"—that we may suppose that Wordsworth's expression
of "liking" was not very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Things become clearer when we reach November 3, 1800, on which day Lamb
thus addressed Manning (I quote verbatim from the original letter):—"At
last I have written to Kemble to know the event of my play, which was
presented last Christmas. As I suspected, came an answer back that the
copy was lost … with a courteous (reasonable!) request of another copy
(if I had one by me), and a promise of a definite answer in a week. I
could not resist so facile and moderate demand: so scribbled out
another, omitting sundry things, such as the witch story, about half the
forest scene (which is too leisurely for <emphasis>story</emphasis>), and transposing that
damn'd soliloquy about England getting drunk, which like its reciter
stupidly stood alone nothing prevenient, or antevenient, and cleared
away a good deal besides … I sent it last night, and am in weekly
expectation of the Tolling Bell and death warrant."</p>
<p>It will be observed that that second copy sent to Kemble must have
differed essentially from the one sent to Manning, for the latter
includes the witch story, and retains in its original place the
soliloquy about England getting drunk.</p>
<p>To this copy sent to Manning we now come in chronological order, but the
exact date of its despatch must remain uncertain. Clearly it was
subsequent, but probably not long subsequent, to Kemble's rejection of
the play, which took place soon after All Souls' Day, for Kemble must
have made up his mind within half an hour of taking up the manuscript. I
venture to assume that the argosy which bore all the treasures recounted
in the following bill of lading sailed about Christmas, 1800. It is sad
to think that the bill of lading itself and the MS. of "Pride's Cure"
are the only salvage.</p>
<p>"I send you all of Coleridge's letters to me which I have preserved;
some of them are upon the subject of my play. I also send you Kemble's
two letters, and the prompter's courteous epistle, with a curious
critique on 'Pride's Cure' by a young Physician from EDINBORO', who
modestly suggests quite another kind of plot. These are monuments of my
disappointments which I like to preserve …You will carefully keep all
(except the Scotch Doctor's, <emphasis>which burn</emphasis>) <emphasis>in statu quo</emphasis> till I come to
claim mine own."</p>
<p>On the reverse of the half-sheet is written: "For Mister Manning |
Teacher of the Mathematics | and the Black Arts, | There is another
letter in the inside cover of the book opposite the blank leaf that
<emphasis>was</emphasis>."</p>
<p>[This is the other letter, written inside the board cover of the copy of
the play, in Charles Lamb's hand:—</p>
<p>"Mind this goes for a letter. (Acknowledge it directly, if only in ten
words.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>"DEAR MANNING:</strong></p>
<p>"(I shall want to hear this comes safe.)</p>
<p>"I have scratched out a good deal, as you will see. Generally, what I
have rejected was either <emphasis>false</emphasis> in <emphasis>feeling</emphasis>, or a violation of
character, mostly of the first sort. I will here just instance in the
concluding few lines of the dying Lover's story, which completely
contradicted his character of <emphasis>violent</emphasis> and <emphasis>unreproachful</emphasis>. I hesitated
a good while what copy to send you, and at last resolved to send the
<emphasis>worst</emphasis>, because you are familiar with it and can make it out; a
stranger would find so much difficulty in doing it, that it would give
him more pain than pleasure. This is compounded precisely of the two
persons' hands you requested it should be.</p>
<p>"Yours sincerely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>"C. LAMB."</strong></p>
<p>The two persons were undoubtedly Charles Lamb and his sister.]</p>
<p>Before proceeding to the MS. itself, it will be desirable to refer to
Lamb's letter to Manning of February 15, 1802, in which he defends
himself against Manning's animadversions on the changes found in the
printed <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>. This letter is addressed to "Mr. Thomas Manning,
Maison Magnan, No. 342 Boulevard Italien, Paris." ….The italics are in
the original:—"<emphasis>Apropos</emphasis>, I think you wrong about <emphasis>my</emphasis> play. All the
omissions are <emphasis>right</emphasis>. And the supplementary scene, in which Sandford
<emphasis>narrates</emphasis> the manner in which his master is affected, is the best in
the book. It stands where a hodge-podge of German puerilities used to
stand. I insist upon it that you like that scene." …</p>
<p>There is one thing more to add. Its excuse is the best in the world—it
is quite new. In that precious letter of February 15, 1801, is a passage
[printed in Canon Ainger's <emphasis>édition de luxe</emphasis>] which shows that Lamb
(probably) tried George Colman the younger with "Pride's Cure." The
potentate of the Haymarket was probably less sublimely courteous in his
rejection than Kemble.</p>
<p>"Now to my own affairs. I have not taken that thing to Colman, but I
have proceeded one step in the business. I have inquired his address and
am promised it in a few days."</p>
<p>[The Manning copy of <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis> is thus described by Mr. Dykes
Campbell]:—It is composed of foolscap sheets stitched into a limp
wrapper of marbled paper. The writing is chiefly Mary Lamb's; her
brother's portion seems to have been done at various times, for the ink
varies in shade, and the handwriting in style.</p>
<p>On the inside of the first cover, as before noted, is written the letter
quoted above. Then comes a page with:—</p>
<p>      Begun August, 1798, finished May, 1799.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      This comes in beginng 2d act.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      (Letter)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      of Marg. to John</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[this being Margaret's "Letter" (page 160 of the present volume).]</p>
<p>On the reverse, Mary has written out the "Characters in 'Pride's Cure,'
a Tragedy." In this list Lovel and Gray are described as "two Court
spies."</p>
<p>On the next page the play opens, but on the top margin is written:—</p>
<p>          "Turn a leaf back for <emphasis>my</emphasis> Letter to Manning.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>                                             "C. LAMB."</strong></p>
<p>The point of the underlining of "my" is to distinguish Lamb's letter
from Margaret's, which chance to face one another in the MS.</p>
<p>Then comes:—</p>
<p>      Pride's Cure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A Tragedy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Act the First. Scene the First.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A Servants' apartment in Wodvil [<emphasis>sic</emphasis>] Hall.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Servants drinking.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      A Song by Daniel.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      "When the King enjoys his own again."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      <emphasis>Peter</emphasis>. A delicate song upon my verity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Where didst learn it, fellow?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And so on for some leaves without material difference from print.</p>
<p>After the speech [page 155] "<emphasis>All</emphasis>. Truly a sad consideration" comes
this continuation of the dialogue:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Daniel</emphasis>. You know what he said to you one day in confidence.</p>
<p><emphasis>Peter</emphasis>. I have reason to remember the words—"'Tis a pity (said he) a
traitor should go unpunished."</p>
<p><emphasis>Francis</emphasis>. Did he say so much?  <emphasis>Peter</emphasis>. As true as I sit here. I told
Daniel of it the same day. Did I not, Daniel?</p>
<p><emphasis>Daniel</emphasis>. Well, I do not know but it may be merrier times with us
servants if Sir Walter never comes back.</p>
<p><emphasis>Francis</emphasis>. But then again, who of us can think of betraying him?</p>
<p><emphasis>Peter</emphasis>. His son, John Woodvil, is the prince of good masters.</p>
<p><emphasis>Daniel</emphasis>. Here is his health, and the King's. (<emphasis>They all drink</emphasis>.) Well,
I cannot see why one of us should not deserve the reward as well as
another man.</p>
<p><emphasis>Martin</emphasis>. Indeed there is something in that.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford enters suddenly</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. You well-fed and unprofitable grooms.</p>
<p>And so on as printed, until we come to Margaret's reply to Sandford's
speech ending [page 156]:—</p>
<p>Since my ["our"] old master quitted all his rights here.</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. Alas! I am sure I find it so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Ah! Mr. Sandford,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            This is no dwelling now for me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            As in Sir Walter's days it was.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I can remember when this house hath been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            A sanctuary to a poor orphan girl</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            From evil tongues and injuries of the world.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Now every day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I must endure fresh insult from the scorn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Of Woodvil's friends, the uncivil jests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And free discourses of the dissolute men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            That haunt this mansion, making me their mirth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Further on in the same dialogue comes the following, after the line in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Margaret's speech [page 158, line 18],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            His love, which ["that"] long has been upon the wane.</p>
<p>            And therefore 'tis men seeing this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Have ta'en their cue and think it now their time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To slur me with their coward disrespects,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Unworthy usages, who, while John lov'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And while one breath'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            That thought not much to take the orphan's part,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And durst as soon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Hold dalliance with the chafed lion's paw,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Or play with fire, or utter blasphemy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            As think a disrespectful thought of Margaret.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. I am too mean a man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Being but a servant in the family,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To be the avenger of a Lady's wrongs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And such a Lady! but I verily think</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            That I should cleave the rudesby to the earth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            With my good oaken staff, and think no harm,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            That offer'd you an insult, I being by.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I warrant you, young Master would forgive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And thank me for the deed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Tho' he I struck were one of his dearest friends.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. O Mr. Sandford, you must think it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I know, as sad undecency in me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To trouble thus your friendly hearing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            With my complaints.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            But I have now no female friend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            In all this house, adviser none, or friend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            To council with, and when I view your face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I call to mind old times,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And how these things were different once</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            When your old friend and master rul'd this house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Nay, never weep; why, man, I trust that yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Sir Walter shall return one day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And thank you for these tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And loving services to his poor orphan.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            For me, I am determined what to do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And so on as printed down to Margaret's line [page 158, line 3 from
foot]:—</p>
<p>            And cowardice grows enamour'd of rare accidents.</p>
<p>The three lines which follow in print [pages 158-9] are not in the MS.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Margaret continues thus:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>            But we must part now.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            I see one coming, that will also observe us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Before night comes we will contrive to meet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And then I will tell you further. Till when, farewell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. My prayers go with you, Lady, and your counsels,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And heaven so prosper them, as I wish you well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                [<emphasis>They part several ways</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here follows:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Scene the Second. A Library in Woodvil Hall; John Woodvil alone.</strong></p>
<p><emphasis>John Woodvil (alone)</emphasis>. Now universal England getteth drunk.</p>
<p>And so on as printed in Act II. [on page 165]. After the last printed
line,</p>
<p>            A fishing, hawking, hunting country gentleman,</p>
<p>the MS. has these five lines, but Lamb drew his pen through them:—</p>
<p>            Great spirits ask great play-room; I would be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            The Phaeton, should put the world to a hazard,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            E'er I'd forego the horses of the sun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            And giddy lustre of my travels' glory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            For tedious common paces.            [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Next comes:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Scene the Third. An apartment in Woodvil Hall; Margaret. Sandford.</strong></p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. I pray you spare me, Mr. Sandford.</p>
<p>And so on as printed as the continuation of the former scene [page 159]
to the end of that and of the first act. But in the middle of Sandford's
speech comes in the "Witch" story, thus introduced:—</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>.] I know a suit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Of lovely Lincoln-green, that much shall grace you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            In the wear, being glossy, fresh and worn but seld,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Young Stephen Woodvil's they were, Sir Walter's eldest son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Who died long since in early youth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. I have somewhere heard his story. I remember</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Sir Walter Rowland would rebuke me, being a girl,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            When I have asked the manner of his death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            But I forget it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. One summer night, Sir Francis, as it chanc'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Was pacing to and fro in the avenue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            That westward fronts our house,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. Methinks I should learn something of his story</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

            Whose garments I am to wear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. Among those aged oaks, etc.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And so the witch story goes on, not quite as printed as a separate poem
in the <emphasis>Works</emphasis> of 1818 [see page 199], but not differing very
materially….</p>
<p>Then comes "Act the Second. John Woodvil alone. Reading a letter (which
stands at the beginning of the book)." The letter is longer in MS. than
in print [see page 160], the words in italics having been withdrawn from
the middle of the second sentence:—</p>
<p>"The course I have taken … seemed to [me] best <emphasis>both for the warding
off of calumny from myself (which should bring dishonor upon the memory
of Sir Rowland my father, if a daughter of his could be thought to
prefer doubtful ease before virtuous sufferance, softness before
reputation), and</emphasis> for the once-for-all releasing of yourself…."</p>
<p>No notable alteration occurs until we come to the second scene, which in
the MS. (owing to the transposition of Woodvil's soliloquy) followed
immediately on Lovel's reply to Woodvil's speech—</p>
<p>            No, you shall go with me into the gallery—</p>
<p>printed on page 164.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Scene the Second. Sherwood Forest. Sir Walter Woodvil, Simon, drest as
Frenchmen.</strong></p>
<p>Sir Walter's opening speech is long in print [page 166]—in MS. it is
but this:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. How fares my boy, Simon, my youngest born,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              My hope, my pride, young Woodvil, speak to me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Thinkest thy brother plays thy father false?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              My life upon his faith and noble heart;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Son John could never play thy father false.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There is no further material change to note until we come to the point
in the conversation between Sir Walter, Simon and Margaret [page 172],
where Simon calls John "a scurvy brother," to whom Margaret responds:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   I speak no slander, Simon, of your brother,
              He is still the first of men.</p>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      I would fain learn that, if you please.</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   Had'st rather hear his praises in the mass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Or parcel'd out in each particular?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      So please you, in the detail: general praise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              We'll leave to his Epitaph-maker.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   I will begin then—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              His face is Fancy's tablet, where the witch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Paints, in her fine caprice, ever new forms,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Making it apt all workings of the soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              All passions and their changes to display;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              His eye, attention's magnet, draws all hearts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      Is this all about your son, Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   Pray let me proceed. His tongue….</p>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      Well skill'd in lying, no doubt—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. Ungracious boy! will you not hear her out?</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   His tongue well skill'd in sweetness to discuss—
              (False tongue that seem'd for love-vows only fram'd)—</p>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      Did I not say so?</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   All knowledge and all topics of converse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Ev'n all the infinite stuff of men's debate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              From matter of fact, to the heights of metaphysick,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              How could she think that noble mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              So furnish'd, so innate in all perfections,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              The manners and the worth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              That go to the making up of a complete Gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Could from his proper nature so decline</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And from that starry height of place he mov'd in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To link his fortune to a lowly Lady</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Who nothing with her brought but her plain heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And truth of love that never swerv'd from Woodvil.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      Wilt please you hear some vices of this brother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              This all-accomplish'd John?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   There is no need—I grant him all you say and more,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Vain, ambitious, large of purpose,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Fantastic, fiery, swift and confident,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              A wayward child of vanity and spleen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              A hair-brain'd mad-cap, dreamer of gold dreams,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              A daily feaster on high self-conceit,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              With many glorious faults beside,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Weak minds mistake for virtues.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      Add to these,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              That having gain'd a virtuous maiden's love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              One fairly priz'd at twenty times his worth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              He let her wander houseless from his door</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To seek new friends and find elsewhere a home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. Fie upon't—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              All men are false, I think, etc.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And here we arrive at the "Dying Lover," which was printed anonymously in the
<emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> for January, 1822. But before passing from the long
passage transcribed above I am bound to say that Lamb drew his pen
through it all, marking some bits "bad" and others "very bad." I venture
to think that in this he did himself some injustice.</p>
<p>To Sir Walter's sweeping indictment Margaret replies as follows. I keep
to the text of the MS., noting some trifling changes made for the
<emphasis>London Magazine</emphasis> [see page 85]:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   All are not false. I knew a youth who died</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              For grief, because his Love proved so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And married to[32] another.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              I saw him on the wedding day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              For he was present in the church that day,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And in his best apparel too[33],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              As one that came to grace the ceremony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              I mark'd him when the ring was given,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              His countenance never changed;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And when the priest pronounced the marriage blessing,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              He put a silent prayer up for the bride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              [For they stood near who saw his lips move.][34]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              He came invited to the marriage-feast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              With the bride's friends,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And was the merriest of them all that day;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              But they, who knew him best, call'd it feign'd mirth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And others said,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              He wore a smile like death's[35] upon his face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              His presence dash'd all the beholders' mirth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And he went away in tears.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      What followed then?</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   Oh! then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              He did not as neglected suitors use</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Affect a life of solitude in shades,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              But lived,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              In free discourse and sweet society,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Among his friends who knew his gentle nature best.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Yet ever when he smiled,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              There was a mystery legible in his face,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              That whoso saw him said he was a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Not long for this world.——</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And true it was, for even then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              The silent love was feeding at his heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Of which he died:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Nor ever spake word of reproach,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Only he wish'd in death that his remains[36]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Might find a poor grave in some spot, not far</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              From his mistress' family vault, "being the place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Where one day Anna should herself be laid."</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>[Footnote 36: Lamb drew his pen through the four concluding lines, and

<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>. A melancholy catastrophe. For my part I shall never die for
love, being as I am, too general-contemplative for the narrow passion. I
am in some sort a general lover.</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. In the name of the Boy-god who plays at blind man's buff
with the Muses, and cares not whom he catches; what is it you love?</p>
<p>And so on until the end of Simon's famous description of the delights of
forest life [page 173]. To this</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis> (<emphasis>smiling</emphasis>). And afterwards them paint in simile.</p>
<p>(<emphasis>To Sir Walter.</emphasis>) I had some foolish questions to put concerning your
son, Sir.—Was John so early valiant as hath been reported? I have heard
some legends of him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. You shall not call them so. Report, in most things
superfluous, in many things altogether an inventress, hath been but too
modest in the delivery of John's true stories.</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   Proceed, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. I saw him on the day of Naseby Fight—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To which he came at twice seven years,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Under the discipline of the Lord Ashley,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              His uncle by the mother's side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Who gave his early principles a bent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Quite from the politics of his father's house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.   I have heard so much.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. There did I see this valiant Lamb of Mars,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              This sprig of honour, this unbearded John,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              This veteran in green years, this sprout, this Woodvil,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              With dreadless ease, guiding a fire-hot steed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Which seem'd to scorn the manage of a boy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Prick forth with such an ease into the field</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To mingle rivalship and deeds of wrath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Even with the sinewy masters of the art[37]!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              The rough fanatic and blood-practis'd soldiery</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Seeing such hope and virtue in the boy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Disclosed their ranks to let him pass unhurt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Checking their swords' uncivil injuries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              As both to mar that curious workmanship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Of valour's beauty in his youthful face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      Mistress Margaret will have need of some refreshment, etc.</p>
<p>Lamb has drawn his pen through this passage, and marked it "bad or
dubious."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 37: Some lines intervene here in the letter to Southey of</p>

<p>

January 21, 1799, which are not in the MS.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p> At the beginning of the fourth act John Woodvil's soliloquy is broken</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

in upon by Sandford. He has just told himself [page 186] that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      Some, the most resolved fools of all,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Have told their dearest secrets in their cups,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>when</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Sandford in haste.</emphasis></p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. O Sir, you have not told them anything?</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Told whom, Sandford?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. Mr. Lovel or Mr. Gray, anything concerning your father?</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Are they not my friends, Sandford?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. Your friends! Lord help you, they your friends! They were no
better than two Court spies set on to get the secret out of you. I have
just discovered in time all their practices.</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. But I have told one of them.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. God forbid, God forbid!</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. How do you know them to be what you said they were?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. Good God!</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Tell me, Sandford, my good Sandford, your master begs it of you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. I cannot speak to you. [<emphasis>Goes out, John following him.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Scene the Second. The forest.</strong></p>
<p>This forest scene has been greatly altered. When Gray has said [page
188], "'Tis a brave youth," etc., there follows:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. Why should I live any longer? There is my sword
(<emphasis>surrendering</emphasis>). Son John, 'tis thou hast brought this disgrace upon us
all.</p>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>. Father, why do you cover your face with your hands? Why do you
draw your breath so hard? See, villains, his heart is burst! O villains,
he cannot speak! One of you run for some water; quick, ye musty rogues:
will ye have your throats cut? [<emphasis>They both slink off.</emphasis>] How is it with
you, father? Look up, Sir Walter, the villains are gone.</p>
<p>"He hears" [page 188], down to "<emphasis>Bears in the body</emphasis>" [page 188], of the
print is not in the MS., which goes on thus:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. Barely a minute's breath is left me now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Which must be spent in charity by me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And, Simon, as you prize my dying words,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              I charge you with your brother live in peace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And be my messenger,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To bear my message to the unhappy boy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              For certain his intent was short of my death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>.      I hope as much, father.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Walter</emphasis>. Tell him I send it with my parting prayer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And you must fall upon his neck and weep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And teach him pray, and love your brother John,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              For you two now are left in the wide world</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              The sole survivors of the Woodvil name.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Bless you, my sons—            [<emphasis>Dies.</emphasis>]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon.</emphasis>      My father's soul is fled.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And now, my trusty servant, my sword,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              One labour yet, my sword, then sleep for ever.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Drink up the poor dregs left of Woodvil's name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And fill the measure of our house's crimes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              How nature sickens,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              To view her customary bands so snapt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              When Love's sweet fires go out in blood of kin,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              And natural regards have left the earth.</p>

<p><emphasis>Margaret (alone).</emphasis>
              They are gone to bear the body to the town,
              It was an error merely and no crime.</p>
<p>And so to the end of her long speech as printed [page 189].</p>
<p>At this point in the MS. comes in "the hodge-podge of German
puerilities" (see the letter to Manning, February 15, 1802), the
sacrifice of which so discontented Manning, who evidently considered the
"supplementary scene" (closing the fourth act, [pages 189 to 191]), as
Lamb called it, a poor substitute.</p>

        For thy advancement, Woodvil, is no less;</p>

        To be a King, a King.</p>

            he will be more calm.</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret.</emphasis> You say he gets no sleep?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford.</emphasis> He hath not slept since Sir Walter died. I have sat up with
him these two nights. Francis takes my place to-night—O! Mistress
Margaret, are not the witch's words come true—"All that we feared and
worse"? Go in and change your garments, you have travelled hard and want
rest.</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret.</emphasis> I will go to bed. You will promise I shall see him in the

<p><emphasis>Francis</emphasis>. I remember, one of the servants, Sir, would pass a few
days with his father at Leicester. The poor old man lies on his deathbed,
and has exprest a desire to see his son before he dies. But none
cared to break the matter to you.</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Send the man here. [<emphasis>Francis goes out</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        My very servants shun my company.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I held my purse to a beggar yesterday</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Who lay and bask'd his sores in the hot sun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And the gaunt pauper did refuse my alms.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Francis returns with Robert</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Come hither, Robert. What is the poor man ailing?</p>
<p><emphasis>Robert</emphasis>. Please your honour, I fear he has partly perish'd for want of
physic. His means are small, and he kept his illness a secret to me not
to put me to expenses.</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Good son, he weeps for his father.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Go take the swiftest horse in my stables,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Take Lightfoot or Eclipse—no, Eclipse is lame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Take Lightfoot then, or Princess[39],</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Ride hard all night to Leicester.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And give him money, money, Francis—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The old man must have medicines, cordials,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And broth to keep him warm, and careful nurses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        He must not die for lack of tendance, Robert.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 39: Lamb puts his pen through these two lines, and writes across
them "miserable bad."]</p>
<p><emphasis>Robert</emphasis>. God bless your honour for your kindness to my poor father.</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Pray, now make haste. You may chance to come in time.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Robert goes out</emphasis>.]</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Go get some firewood, Francis,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        And get my supper ready. [<emphasis>Francis goes out</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        The night is bitter cold.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        They in their graves feel nothing of the cold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Or if they do, how dull a cold—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        All clayey, clayey. Ah God! who waits below?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Come up, come quick. I saw a fearful sight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Francis returns in haste with wood</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. There are such things as spirits, deny it who may.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Is it you, Francis? Heap the wood on thick,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        We two shall sup together, sup all night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Carouse, drink drunk, and tell the merriest tales—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Tell for a wager, who tells merriest—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        But I am very weak. O tears, tears, tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        I feel your just rebuke. [<emphasis>Goes out</emphasis>.]</p>

<p><strong>Scene changes to a bed-room. John sitting alone: a lamp burning by him.</strong></p>
<p>"Infinite torments for finite offences." I will never believe it. How
divines can reconcile this monstrous tenet with the spirit of their
Theology! They have palpably failed in the proof, for to put the
question thus:—If he being infinite—have a care, Woodvil, the latitude
of doubting suits not with the humility of thy condition. What good men
have believed, may be true, and what they profess to find set down
clearly in their scriptures, must have probability in its defence[40].
Touching that other question the Casuists with one consent have
pronounced the sober man accountable for the deeds by him in a state of
drunkenness committed, because tho' the action indeed be such as he,
sober, would never have committed, yet the drunkenness being an act of
the will, by a moral fiction, the issues are accounted voluntary also. I
lose my sleep in attending to these intricacies of the schoolmen. I lay
till daybreak the other morning endeavouring to draw a line of
distinction between sin of direct malice and sin of malice indirect, or
imputable only by the sequence. My brain is overwrought by these
labours, and my faculties will shortly decline into impotence. [<emphasis>Throws
himself on a bed</emphasis>.]</p>
<p>End of the Fourth Act.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 40: Lamb had crossed out this passage from "Infinite
torments," and written at "touching" "begin here."]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the fifth act of the printed play [page 192] we have simply "Margaret
enters." In the MS. Sandford prepares his master for her advent, and
announces her thus:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. Wilt please you to see company to-day, Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Who thinks me worth the visiting?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sandford</emphasis>. One that traveled hard last night to see you,
She waits to know your pleasure.</p>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. A lady too! pray send her to me—
Some curiosity, I suppose.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Sandford goes out and returns with Margaret</emphasis>.]</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. Woodvil![41]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[Footnote 41: "Woodvil!" and some illegible words struck out, and nothing
substituted.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>John</emphasis>. Comes Margaret here, etc.</p>
<p>When, a page further on [page 194], John has declared to Margaret that</p>
<p>      This earth holds not alive so poor a thing as I am—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I was not always thus,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>the MS. went on (but the passage is struck out as "bad"):—</p>
<p>      You must bear with me, Margaret, as a child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      For I am weak as tender Infancy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And cannot bear rebuke—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Would'st think it, Love!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      They hoot and spit upon me as I pass</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      In the public streets: one shows me to his neighbour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Who shakes his head and turns away with horror—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      I was not always thus—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. Thou noble nature, etc.</p>
<p>The next scene—the last [page l95]—is much cut about. The long speech
of Margaret beginning,</p>
<p>      To give you in your stead a better self,</p>
<p>and John's reply [both printed at pages 196-7], are struck out, and
"Nimis" written by Lamb's pen in large characters in the margin;
but after that all goes on in harmony with the print, to the end:—</p>
<p>      It seem'd the guilt of blood was passing from me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      Even in the act and agony of tears</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      And all my sins forgiven.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At this point in the MS. Simon arrives:—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>      [<emphasis>A noise is heard as of one without, clamorous to come in</emphasis>.]</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>. 'Tis your brother Simon, John.</p>
<p><emphasis>Enter Simon, with his sword in a menacing posture, John staggers
towards him and falls at his feet, Margaret standing over him.</emphasis></p>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>. Is this the man I came so far to see—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         The perfect Cavalier, the finish'd courtier</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         Whom Ladies lov'd, the gallant curled Woodvil,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         Whom brave men fear'd, the valiant, fighting Woodvil,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         The haughty high-ambitioned Parricide—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         The same that sold his father's secret in his cups,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         And held it but an after-dinner's trick?—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         So humble and in tears, a crestfallen penitent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         And crawling at a younger brother's feet!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         The sinews of my [<emphasis>stiff</emphasis>] revenge grow slack.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         My brother, speak to me, my brother John.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         (<emphasis>Aside</emphasis>) Now this is better than the beastly deed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         Which I did meditate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>John (rising and resuming his old dignity)</emphasis>. You come to take my life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         I know it well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         You come to fight with me—[<emphasis>Laying his hand upon his sword</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         This arm was busy on the day of Naseby:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         'Tis paralytic now, and knows no use of weapons.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         The luck is yours, Sir. [<emphasis>Surrenders his sword</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>. My errand is of peace:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         A dying father's blessing and lost prayers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         For his misguided son.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         Sir Walter sends it with his parting breath.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         He bade me with my brother live in peace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         He bade me fall upon his neck and weep,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         (As I now do) and love my brother John;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         For we are only left in the wide world</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         The poor survivors of the Woodvil name. [<emphasis>They embrace</emphasis>.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Simon</emphasis>. And Margaret here shall witness our atonement—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         (For Margaret still hath followed all your fortunes).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         And she shall dry thy tears and teach thee pray.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         So we'll together seek some foreign land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         Where our sad story, John, shall never reach.</p>

<p><emphasis>End of "Pride's Cure" and Charles Lamb's Dramatic Works!!</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>After all this [Mr. Campbell adds finally] is the reader prepared to
think Manning altogether wrong and Lamb altogether right as to what was
done in the process of transforming Pride's Cure into <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>?</p>
<p>The version of 1818 here printed differs practically only in
minor matters of typography and punctuation from that of 1802.
There are, however, a few alterations which should be noted. On
page 176, in John's first speech, "fermentations" was, in 1802,
"stimuli." On page 178, in the speech of the Third Gentleman,
there is a change. In 1802 he said "(<emphasis>dashing his glass down</emphasis>)
Pshaw, damn these acorn cups, they would not drench a fairy.
Who shall pledge," &amp;c. And at the end of Act III, one line is
omitted. In 1802 John was made to say, after disarming Lovel
(page 186):—</p>
<p>      Still have the will without the power to execute,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      As unfear'd Eunuchs meditate a rape.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This simile, which one reviewer fell upon with some violence, was
not reprinted.</p>
<p>Mr. Thomas Hutchinson, writing in The Athenceum, December 28, 1901,
remarks: "The truth is that in Lamb's imitations of the elder writers
'anachronistic improprieties' (as Thomas Warton would say) are
exceedingly rare. In <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis> it would not, I think, be easy to
discover more than two: <emphasis>caprice</emphasis>, which, in the sense of 'a capricious
disposition,' seems to belong to the eighteenth century, and <emphasis>anecdotes</emphasis>
(i.e., 'secret Court history'), which, in its English form at least,
probably does not occur much before 1686."</p>
<p>This note is already too long, or I should like to say something of the
reception of <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>, which was not cordial. The <emphasis>Annual Review</emphasis>
was particularly severe, and the <emphasis>Edinburgh</emphasis> caustic.</p>

<p>Page 109. "THE WITCH."</p>
<p>In the <emphasis>Works</emphasis>, 1818, this dramatic sketch followed <emphasis>John Woodvil</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Lamb sent "The Witch" to Robert Lloyd in November, 1798 (see <emphasis>Charles
Lamb and the Lloyds</emphasis>, page 91), in a version differing widely from that
of the <emphasis>Works</emphasis> here given. The speakers are Sir Walter Woodvil's steward
and Margaret. The principal variation is this, after the curse:—</p>
<p><emphasis>Margaret</emphasis>.    A terrible curse!</p>
<p><emphasis>Old Steward</emphasis>. O Lady! such bad things are said of that old woman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               You would be loth to hear them!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               Namely, that the milk she gave was sour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               And the babe, who suck'd her, shrivell'd like a mandrake,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               And things besides, with a bigger horror in them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               Almost, I think, unlawful to be told!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In the penultimate line "The mystery of God" was "Creation's beauteous
workmanship."</p>

<p>Page 202. "MR. H——."</p>
<p>Lamb composed this farce in the winter 1805-1806. Writing to Hazlitt on
February 19, 1806, he says: "Have taken a room at 3s. a week to be in
between 5 and 8 at night, to avoid my <emphasis>nocturnal</emphasis> alias <emphasis>knock-eternal</emphasis>
visitors. The first-fruits of my retirement has been a farce which goes
to manager tomorrow." Mary Lamb, writing to Sarah Stoddart at about the
same time, says: "Charles is gone [to the lodging] to finish the farce,
and I am to hear it read this night. I am so uneasy between my hopes and
fears of how I shall like it, that I do not know what I am doing." The
next day or so, February 21, she says that she liked the farce "very
much, and cannot help having great hopes of its success"—stating that
she has carried it to Mr. Wroughton at Drury Lane.</p>
<p>The reply came on June n, 1806, saying that the farce was accepted,
subject to a few alterations, and would be produced in due course (see
Lamb's letter to Wordsworth, written in "wantonness of triumph," of June
26). Mary Lamb, writing to Sarah Stoddart, probably in October, 1806,
says that</p>
<p>    Charles took an emendated copy of his farce to Mr. Wroughton, the
    Manager, yesterday. Mr. Wroughton was very friendly to him, and
    expressed high approbation of the farce; but there are two, he tells
    him, to come out before it…. We are pretty well, and in fresh
    hopes about this farce.</p>
<p>Lamb tells Manning about it, on December 5, adding after an outline of
the plot:—"That's the idea—how flat it is here—but how whimsical in
the farce!" Later he says: "I shall get £200 from the theatre if 'Mr.
H——' has a good run, and, I hope, £100 for the copyright. Nothing if
it fails; and there never was a more ticklish thing. The whole depends
on the manner in which the name is brought out, which I value myself on,
as a <emphasis>chef-d'oeuvre</emphasis>." And a little later still: "N.B. If my little
thing don't succeed, I shall easily survive."</p>
<p>"Mr. H——" was produced on December 10, 1806. The play-bill for the
night ran thus:—</p>
<p>                       Theatre Royal, Drury-Lane</p>
<empty-line/>

                The Prologue to be spoken by Mr. Elliston</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                               [&amp;c., &amp;c.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>According to Mrs. Baron-Wilson's <emphasis>Memoirs of (Miss Mellon)</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Harriet, Duchess of St. Albans</emphasis>, Lamb was allowed to cast "Mr.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

H——" himself. Miss Mellon played the heroine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Lambs sat near the orchestra with Hazlitt and Crabb Robinson, and
the house was well salted with friendly clerks from the East India House
and the South-Sea House. The prologue went capitally; and all was well
with the play until the name of Hogsflesh was pronounced. Then
disapproval set in in a storm of hisses, in which, Crabb Robinson tells
us, Lamb joined heartily, standing on his seat to do so.</p>
<p>In a report of the first night of "Mr. H——" in <emphasis>Monthly Literary
Recreations</emphasis> for December, 1806, we read that on the secret of the name
being made public "all interest vanished, the audience were disgusted,
and the farce went on to its very conclusion almost unheard, amidst the
contending clamours of 'Silence,' 'Hear! hear!' and 'Off! off! off!'"</p>
<p>Writing to Wordsworth on the next day Lamb told the story:—"Mr. H——
came out last night and failed. I had many fears; the subject was not
substantial enough. John Bull must have solider fare than a <emphasis>Letter</emphasis>. We
are pretty stout about it, have had plenty of condoling friends, but
after all, we had rather it should have succeeded. You will see the
Prologue in most of the Morning Papers. It was received with such shouts
as I never witness'd to a Prologue. It was attempted to be encored. How
hard! a thing I did merely as a task, because it was wanted—and set no
great store by; and Mr. H.!! The quantity of friends we had in the house
my brother and I being in Public Offices &amp;c. was astonishing—but they
yielded at length to a few hisses—"a hundred hisses—damn the word, I
write it like kisses—how different—a hundred hisses outweigh 1000
claps. The former come more directly from the Heart. Well, 'tis
withdrawn and there is an end. Better Luck to us."</p>
<p>Writing to Sarah Stoddart, Lamb put the case thus:—"Mary is a little
cut at the ill success of 'Mr. H.,' which came out last night, and
<emphasis>failed</emphasis>. I know you'll be sorry, but never mind. We are determined not
to be cast down. I am going to leave off tobacco, and then we must
thrive. A smoking man must write smoky farces." Thereafter Lamb's
attitude to "Mr. H——" was always one of humorous resignation.</p>
<p>Lamb should have chosen a better, by which I mean a worse,
name than Hogsflesh. As a matter of fact a great number of
persons had become quite accustomed to the asperities of Hogsflesh,
not only from the famous cricketer of that name, one of the pioneers
of the game, but also from the innkeeper at Worthing. Indeed an
old rhyme current at the end of the eighteenth century anticipated
some of Lamb's humour, for the two principal landlords of Worthing,
which was just then beginning to be a fashionable resort, were
named Hogsflesh and Bacon, leading to the quatrain:—</p>
<p>      Brighton is a pretty street,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        Worthing is much taken;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

      If you can't get any other meat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

        There's Hogsflesh and Bacon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Drury Lane authorities do not seem to have considered the failure as
absolute as did Lamb, for on the next day—December 11—the bills
announced:—</p>
<p>   *** The New Farce of Mr. H——, performed for the first time last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   night, was received by an overflowing audience with universal applause,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

   and will be repeated for the second time to-morrow.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But the next evening's bill—December 12, 1806—stated that "The New</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farce of Mr. H—— is withdrawn at the request of the author."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>"Mr. H——" did not then disappear altogether from the stage. A
correspondent of <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>, May 26, 1855, remembered seeing it
at Philadelphia when he was a boy. The last scene, he says, particularly
amused the audience. And in William B. Wood's <emphasis>Personal Recollections of
the Stage</emphasis>, 1855, it is recorded of the Philadelphia Theatre, of which
he was manager, that in 1812, "Charles Lamb's excellent farce of 'Mr.
H——' met with extraordinary success, and was played an unusual number
of nights." Lamb, however, did not profit thereby.</p>
<p>The little play was published in Philadelphia in 1813 under the title
<emphasis>Mr. H——, or Beware a Bad Name. A farce in two acts, as performed at
the Philadelphia Theatre</emphasis>—Lamb's name not figuring in any way in
connection with it.</p>
<p>In England "Mr. H——" was not revived until 1885, when, as a curiosity,
it was played by the Dramatic Students' Society. The performance was
held at the Gaiety on October 27, 1885, the prologue being spoken by a
gentleman made up to resemble Lamb. At the Cheadle Town Hall on October
19 and 20, 1910, "Mr. H——" was given again, with the difference that
the secret of the name was disclosed from the start.</p>
<p>In <emphasis>Notes and Queries</emphasis>, August 3, 1889, the following amusing play-bill
was printed, contributed by Mr. Bertram Dobell:—</p>

<p>Mr. Dobell wonders if Lamb had any knowledge of this performance, and he
suggests that possibly he had a hand in the bill. Certainly the
interpolations concerning damnation are in his manner.</p>
<p>I add a few notes:—</p>
<p>Page 208. <emphasis>The man with the great nose</emphasis>. See Slawkenbergius's tale in
<emphasis>Tristram Shandy</emphasis>, Vol. IV.</p>
<p>Page 212. <emphasis>The feeling Hurley</emphasis>. Harley was the hero of Henry Mackenzie's
novel, <emphasis>The Man of Feeling</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Page 217. <emphasis>Jeremiah Pry</emphasis>. John Poole may have taken a hint here for his
farce "Paul Pry," produced in September, 1825. Lamb and he knew each
other slightly. Lamb analysed the prying nature again in <emphasis>The New Times</emphasis>
early in 1825, in two papers on "Tom Pry" and "Tom Pry's Wife" which
will be found in Vol. I. of this edition.</p>
<p>Page 220. <emphasis>Old Q——</emphasis>. William Douglas, fourth Duke of Queensberry
(1724-1810), the most notorious libertine of his later days.</p>
<p>Page 224. <emphasis>John, my valet</emphasis>. This is a very similar incident to that
described in the <emphasis>Elia</emphasis> essay on the "Old Benchers," where Lovel (John
Lamb) warns Samuel Salt, when dressing him, not to allude, at the party
to which he is going, to the unfortunate Miss Blandy.</p>
<p>Page 228, line 1. <emphasis>Mother Damnable</emphasis>. There was at Kentish Town a
notorious old shrew who bore this nickname in the 17th century.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 238. "THE PAWNBROKER'S DAUGHTER."</p>
<p>Printed in <emphasis>Blackwood</emphasis>, January, 1830, and not reprinted by Lamb.</p>
<p>This little play was never acted. Lamb refers to it in a letter to
Bernard Barton—in July, 1829—as "an old rejected farce"; and Canon
Ainger mentions a note of Lamb's to Charles Mathews, in October, 1828,
offering the farce for production at the Adelphi. The theme is one that
seems always to have interested Lamb (see his essay on the
"Inconveniences of Being Hanged," Vol. I.).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 243, line 3. "<emphasis>An Argument against the Use of Animal Food.</emphasis>" Joseph
Ritson, 1752-1803, the antiquarian, was converted to vegetarianism by
Mandeville's <emphasis>Fable of the Bees</emphasis>. The work from which Cutlet quotes was
published in 1802. Pope's motto is from the <emphasis>Essay on Man</emphasis>, I., lines
81-84.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Page 243, last line. <emphasis>Mr. Molyneux … in training to fight Cribb</emphasis>.
Cutlet's rump steak did not avail in either of the great struggles
between Tom Cribb and Tom Molineaux. At their first meeting, on December
18, 1810, Molineaux went under at the thirty-third round; and in the
return match, on September 28, 1811, Molineaux's jaw was broken at the
ninth and he gave in at the eleventh, to the great disappointment of the
20,000 spectators. Mr. Molineaux was a negro.</p>

<p>
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.</p>
<p>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>

Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at

<p>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works</p>
<p>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
<p>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
<p>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>
<p>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.</p>

<p>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
<p>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>
<p>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
<p>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.</p>
<p>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>
<p>

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works

<p>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
<p>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>
<p>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
<p>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>
<p>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
