<p><strong>PREFACE</strong></p>
<p>You should know at the outset what this book does <emphasis>not</emphasis> attempt to
do. It does not, save to the extent that its own special purpose requires,
concern itself with the many and intricate problems of grammar, rhetoric,
spelling, punctuation, and the like; or clarify the thousands of
individual difficulties regarding correct usage. All these matters are
important. Concise treatment of them may be found in THE CENTURY HANDBOOK
OF WRITING and THE CENTURY DESK BOOK OF GOOD ENGLISH, both of which
manuals are issued by the present publishers. But this volume confines
itself to the one task of placing at your disposal the means of adding to
your stock of words, of increasing your vocabulary.</p>
<p>It does not assume that you are a scholar, or try to make you one. To be
sure, it recognizes the ends of scholarship as worthy. It levies at every
turn upon the facts which scholarship has accumulated. But it demands of
you no technical equipment, nor leads you into any of those bypaths of
knowledge, alluring indeed, of which the benefits are not immediate. For
example, in Chapter V it forms into groups words etymologically akin to
each other. It does this for an end entirely practical—namely, that the
words you know may help you to understand the words you do not know. Did
it go farther—did it account for minor differences in these words by
showing that they sprang from related rather than identical originals, did
it explain how and how variously their forms have been modified in the
long process of their descent—it would pass beyond its strict utilitarian
bounds. This it refrains from doing. And thus everything it contains it
rigorously subjects to the test of serviceability. It helps you to bring
more and more words into workaday harness—to gain such mastery over them
that you can speak and write them with fluency, flexibility, precision,
and power. It enables you, in your use of words, to attain the readiness
and efficiency expected of a capable and cultivated man.</p>
<p>There are many ways of building a vocabulary, as there are many ways of
attaining and preserving health. Fanatics may insist that one should be
cultivated to the exclusion of the others, just as health-cranks may
declare that diet should be watched in complete disregard of recreation,
sanitation, exercise, the need for medicines, and one's mental attitude to
life. But the sum of human experience, rather than fanaticism, must
determine our procedure. Moreover experience has shown that the various
successful methods of bringing words under man's sway are not mutually
antagonistic but may be practiced simultaneously, just as health is
promoted, not by attending to diet one year, to exercise the next, and to
mental attitude the third, but by bestowing wise and fairly constant
attention on all. Yet it would be absurd to state that all methods of
increasing one's vocabulary, or of attaining vigor of physique, are
equally valuable. This volume offers everything that helps, and it yields
space in proportion to helpfulness.</p>
<p>Aside from a brief introductory chapter, a chapter (number X) given over
to a list of words, and a brief concluding chapter, the subject matter of
the volume falls into three main divisions. Chapters II and III are based
on the fact that we must all use words in combination—must fling the
words out by the handfuls, even as the accomplished pianist must strike
his notes. Chapters IV and V are based on the fact that we must become
thoroughly acquainted with individual words—that no one who scorns to
study the separate elements of speech can command powerful and
discriminating utterance. Chapters VI, VII, VIII, and IX are based on the
fact that we need synonyms as our constant lackeys—that we should be able
to summon, not a word that will do, but a word that will express the idea
with precision. Exercises scattered throughout the book, together with
five of the six appendices, provide well-nigh inexhaustible materials for
practice.</p>
<p>For be it understood, once for all, that this volume is not a machine
which you can set going and then sit idly beside, the while your
vocabulary broadens. Mastery over words, like worthy mastery of any kind
whatsoever, involves effort for yourself. You can of course contemplate
the nature and activities of the mechanism, and learn something thereby;
but also you must work—work hard, work intelligently. As you cannot
acquire health by watching a gymnast take exercise or a doctor swallow
medicine or a dietician select food, so you cannot become an overlord of
words without first fighting battles to subjugate them. Hence this volume
is for you less a labor-saving machine than a collection and arrangement
of materials which you must put together by hand. It assembles everything
you need. It tags everything plainly. It tells you just what you must do.
In these ways it makes your task far easier. <emphasis>But the task is yours</emphasis>.
Industry, persistence, a fair amount of common sense—these three you must
have. Without them you will accomplish nothing.</p>
<p>Even with them—let the forewarning be candid—you will not accomplish
everything. You cannot learn all there is to be learned about words, any
more than about human nature. And what you do achieve will be, not a
sudden attainment, but a growth. This is not the dark side of the picture.
It is an honest avowal that the picture is not composed altogether of
light. But as the result of your efforts an adequate vocabulary will some
day be yours. Nor will you have to wait long for an earnest of ultimate
success. Just as system will speedily transform a haphazard business into
one which seizes opportunities and stops the leakage of profits, so will
sincere and well-directed effort bring you promptly and surely into an
ever-growing mastery of words.</p>

<p><strong>    REASONS FOR INCREASING YOUR VOCABULARY</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Sometimes a dexterous use of words appears to us to be only a kind of
parlor trick. And sometimes it <emphasis>is</emphasis> just that. The command of a wide
vocabulary is in truth an accomplishment, and like any other
accomplishment it may be used for show. But not necessarily. Just as a man
may have money without "flashing" it, or an extensive wardrobe without
sporting gaudy neckties or wearing a dress suit in the morning, so may he
possess linguistic resources without making a caddish exhibition of them.
Indeed the more distant he stands from verbal bankruptcy, the less likely
he is to indulge in needless display.</p>
<p>Again, glibness of speech sometimes awakens our distrust. We like actions
rather than words; we prefer that character, personality, and kindly
feelings should be their own mouthpiece. So be it. But there are thoughts
and emotions properly to be shared with other people, yet incapable of
being revealed except through language. It is only when language is
insincere—when it expresses lofty sentiments or generous sympathies, yet
springs from designing selfishness—that it justly arouses misgivings.
Power over words, like power of any other sort, is for use, not abuse.
That it sometimes is abused must not mislead us into thinking that it
should in itself be scorned or neglected.</p>
<p>Our contempt and distrust do not mean that our fundamental ideas about
language are unsound. Beneath our wholesome dislike for shallow facility
and insincerity of speech, we have a conviction that the mastery of words
is a good thing, not a bad. We are therefore unwilling to take the vow of
linguistic poverty. If we lack the ability to bend words to our use, it is
from laziness, not from scruple. We desire to speak competently, but
without affectation. We know that if our diction rises to this dual
standard, it silently distinguishes us from the sluggard, the weakling,
and the upstart. For such diction is not to be had on sudden notice, like
a tailor-made suit. Nor can it, like such a suit, deceive anybody as to
our true status. A man's utterance reveals what he is. It is the measure
of his inward attainment. The assertion has been made that for a man to
express himself freely and well in his native language is the surest proof
of his culture. Meditate the saying. Can you think of a proof that is
surer?</p>
<p>But a man's speech does more than lend him distinction. It does more than
reveal to others what manner of man he is. It is an instrument as well as
an index. It is an agent—oftentimes indeed it is <emphasis>the</emphasis> agent—of his
influence upon others. How silly are those persons who oppose words to
things, as if words were not things at all but air-born unrealities! Words
are among the most powerful realities in the world. You vote the
Republican ticket. Why? Because you have studied the issues of the
campaign and reached a well-reasoned conclusion how the general interests
may be served? Possibly. But nine times in ten it will be because of that
<emphasis>word</emphasis> Republican. You may believe that in a given instance the
Republican cause or candidate is inferior; you may have nothing personally
to lose through Republican defeat; yet you squirm and twist and seek
excuses for casting a Republican ballot. Such is the power—aye, sometimes
the tyranny—of a word. The word <emphasis>Republican</emphasis> has not been selected
invidiously. <emphasis>Democrat</emphasis> would have served as well. Or take religious
words—<emphasis>Catholic, Methodist, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Baptist,
Lutheran,</emphasis> or what not. A man who belongs, in person or by proxy, to
one of the sects designated may be more indifferent to the institution
itself than to the word that represents it. Thus you may attack in his
presence the tenets of Presbyterianism, for example, but you must be wary
about calling the Presbyterian name. <emphasis>Mother, the flag</emphasis>—what sooner
than an insult coupled with these terms will rouse a man to fight? But
does that man kiss his mother, or salute the flag, or pay much heed to
either? Probably not. Words not realities? With what realities must we
more carefully reckon? Words are as dangerous as dynamite, as beneficent
as brotherhood. An unfortunate word may mean a plea rejected, an
enterprise baffled, half the world plunged into war. A fortunate word may
open a triple-barred door, avert a disaster, bring thousands of people
from jealousy and hatred into coöperation and goodwill.</p>
<p>Nor is it solely on their emotional side that men may be affected by
words. Their thinking and their esthetic nature also—their hard sense and
their personal likes and dislikes—are subject to the same influence. You
interview a potential investor; does he accept your proposition or not? A
prospective customer walks into your store; does he buy the goods you show
him? You enter the drawing room of one of the elite; are you invited again
and again? Your words will largely decide—your words, or your verbal
abstinence. For be it remembered that words no more than dollars are to be
scattered broadcast for the sole reason that you have them. The right word
should be used at the right time—and at that time only. Silence is
oftentimes golden. Nevertheless there are occasions for us to speak.
Frequent occasions. To be inarticulate <emphasis>then</emphasis> may mean only
embarrassment. It may—some day it will—mean suffering and failure. That
we may make the most of the important occasions sure to come, we must have
our instruments ready. Those instruments are words. He who commands words
commands events—commands men.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>II</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    WORDS IN COMBINATION: SOME PITFALLS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You wish, then, to increase your vocabulary. Of course you must become
observant of words and inquisitive about them. For words are like people:
they have their own particular characteristics, they do their work well or
ill, they are in good odor or bad, and they yield best service to him who
loves them and tries to understand them. Your curiosity about them must be
burning and insatiable. You must study them when they have withdrawn from
the throng of their fellows into the quiescence of their natural selves.
You must also see them and study them in action, not only as they are
employed in good books and by careful speakers, but likewise as they fall
from the lips of unconventional speakers who through them secure vivid and
telling effects. In brief, you must learn word nature, as you learn human
nature, from a variety of sources.</p>
<p>Now in ordinary speech most of us use words, not as individual things, but
as parts of a whole—as cogs in the machine of utterance by which we
convey our thoughts and feelings. We do not think of them separately at
all. And this instinct is sound. In our expression we are like large-scale
manufacturing plants rather than one-man establishments. We have at our
disposal, not one worker, but a multitude. Hence we are concerned with our
employees collectively and with the total production of which they are
capable. To be sure, our understanding of them as individuals will
increase the worth and magnitude of our output. But clearly we must have
large dealings with them in the aggregate.</p>
<p>This chapter and the following, therefore, are given over to the study of
words in combination. As in all matters, there is a negative as well as a
positive side to be reckoned with. Let us consider the negative side
first.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Tameness&gt;</p>
<p>Correct diction is too often insipid. There is nothing wrong with it, but
it does not interest us—it lacks character, lacks color, lacks power. It
too closely resembles what we conceive of the angels as having—
impeccability without the warmth of camaraderie. Speech, like a man,
should be alive. It need not, of course, be boisterous. It may be intense
in a quiet, modest way. But if it too sedulously observes all the <emphasis>Thou
shalt not's</emphasis> of the rhetoricians, it will refine the vitality out of
itself and leave its hearers unmoved.</p>
<p>That is why you should become a disciple of the pithy, everyday
conversationalist and of the rough-and-ready master of harangue as well as
of the practitioner of precise and scrupulous discourse. Many a speaker or
writer has thwarted himself by trying to be "literary." Even Burns when he
wrote classic English was somewhat conscious of himself and made, in most
instances, no extraordinary impression. But the pieces he impetuously
dashed off in his native Scotch dialect can never be forgotten. The man
who begins by writing naturally, but as his importance in the publishing
world grows, pays more and more attention to felicities—to "style"—and
so spoils himself, is known to the editor of every magazine. Any editorial
office force can insert missing commas and semicolons, and iron out
blunders in the English; but it has not the time, if indeed the ability,
to instil life into a lifeless manuscript. A living style is rarer than an
inoffensive one, and the road of literary ambition is strewn with failures
due to "correctness."</p>
<p>Cultivate readiness, even daring, of utterance. A single turn of
expression may be so audacious that it plucks an idea from its shroud or
places within us an emotion still quivering and warm. Sustained discourse
may unflaggingly clarify or animate. But such triumphs are beyond the
reach of those, whether speakers or writers, who are constantly pausing to
grope for words. This does not mean that scrutiny of individual words is
wasted effort. Such scrutiny becomes the basis indeed of the more
venturesome and inspired achievement. We must serve our apprenticeship to
language. We must know words as a general knows the men under him—all
their ranks, their capabilities, their shortcomings, the details and
routine of their daily existence. But the end for which we gain our
understanding must be to hurl these words upon the enemy, not as
disconnected units, but as battalions, as brigades, as corps, as armies.
Dr. Johnson, one of the most effective talkers in all history, resolved
early in life that, always, and whatever topic might be broached, he
would on the moment express his thoughts and feelings with as much vigor
and felicity as if he had unlimited leisure to draw on. And Patrick Henry,
one of the few really irresistible orators, was wont to plunge headlong
into a sentence and trust to God Almighty to get him out.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Tameness</p>
<p>1. Study Appendix I (The Drift of Our Rural Population Cityward).
Do you regard it as written simply, with force and natural feeling? Or
does it show lack of spontaneity?—suffer from an unnatural and self-
conscious manner of writing? Is the style one you would like to cultivate
for your own use?</p>
<p>2. Express, if you can, in more vigorous language of your own, the thought
of the editorial.</p>
<p>3. Think of some one you have known who has the gift of racy colloquial
utterance. Make a list of offhand, homely, or picturesque expressions you
have heard him employ, and ask yourself what it is in these expressions
that has made them linger in your memory. With them in mind, and with your
knowledge of the man's methods of imparting his ideas vividly, try to make
your version of the editorial more forceful still.</p>
<p>4. Study Appendix 2 (Causes for the American Spirit of Liberty) as an
example of stately and elaborate, yet energetic, discourse. The speech
from which this extract is taken was delivered in Parliament in a vain
effort to stay England from driving her colonies to revolt. Some of
Burke's turns of phrase are extremely bold and original, as "The religion
most prevalent in our northern colonies is a refinement on the principle
of resistance; it is the dissidence of dissent and the Protestantism of
the Protestant religion." Moreover, with all his fulness of diction, Burke
could cleave to the heart of an idea in a few words, as "Freedom is to
them [the southern slave-holders] not only an enjoyment, but a kind of
rank and privilege." Find other examples of bold or concise and
illuminating utterance.</p>
<p>5. Read Appendix 3 (Parable of the Sower). It has no special audacities of
phrase, but escapes tameness in various ways—largely through its simple
earnestness.</p>
<p>6. Make a list of the descriptive phrases in Appendix 4 (The Seven Ages of
Man) through which Shakespeare gives life and distinctness to his
pictures.</p>
<p>7. Study Appendix 5 (The Castaway) as a piece of homely, effective
narrative. (Defoe wrote for the man in the street. He was a literary
jack-of-all-trades whom dignified authors of his day would not
countenance, but who possessed genius.) It relies upon directness and
plausibility of substance and style rather than temerity of phrase. Yet it
never sags into tameness. Notice how everyday expressions ("My business
was to hold my breath," "I took to my heels") add subtly to our belief
that what Defoe is telling us is true. Notice also that such expressions
("the least capful of wind," "half dead with the water I took in," "ready
to burst with holding my breath") without being pretentious may yet be
forceful. Notice finally the naturalness and lift of the sinewy idioms ("I
fetched another run," "I had no clothes to shift me," "I had like to have

<p>&lt;Slovenliness&gt;</p>
<p>Though we are to recognize the advantage of working in the undress of
speech rather than in stiffly-laundered literary linens, though we are not
to despise the accessions of strength and of charm which we may obtain
from the homely and familiar, we must never be careless. The man whose
speech is slovenly is like the man who chews gum—unblushingly
commonplace.</p>
<p>We must struggle to maintain our individuality. We must not be a mere copy
of everybody else. We must put into our words the cordiality we put into
our daily demeanor. If we greeted friend or stranger carelessly,
conventionally, we should soon be regarded as persons of no force or
distinction. So of our speech and our writing. Nothing, to be sure, is
more difficult than to give them freshness without robbing them of
naturalness and ease. Yet that is what we must learn to do. We shall not
acquire the power in a day. We shall acquire it as a chess or a baseball
player acquires his skill—by long effort, hard practice.</p>
<p>One thing to avoid is the use of words in loose, or fast-and-loose,
senses. Do not say that owning a watch is a fine proposition if you mean
that it is advantageous. Do not say that you trembled on the brink of
disaster if you were threatened with no more than inconvenience or
comparatively slight injury. Do not say you were literally scared to death
if you are yet alive to tell the story.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Slovenliness I</p>
<p>Give moderate or accurate utterance to the following ideas:</p>
<p>The burning of the hen-coop was a mighty conflagration.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fact that the point of the pencil was broken profoundly surprised me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

A cold bath is pretty nice of mornings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To go a little late is just the article.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Another thing to avoid is the use of words in the wrong parts of speech,
as a noun for a verb, or an adjective for an adverb. Sometimes newspapers
are guilty of such faults; for journalistic English, though pithy, shows
here and there traces of its rapid composition. You must look to more
leisurely authorities. The speakers and writers on whom you may rely will
not say "to burglarize," "to suspicion," "to enthuse," "plenty rich,"
"real tired," "considerable discouraged," "a combine," or "humans." An
exhaustive list of such errors cannot be inserted here. If you feel
yourself uncertain in these details of usage, you should have access to
such a volume as <emphasis>The Century Desk Book of Good English</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Slovenliness II</p>
<p>1. For each quoted expression in the preceding paragraph compose a
sentence which shall contain the correct form, or the grammatical
equivalent, of the expression.</p>
<p>2. Correct the following sentences:</p>
<p>The tramp suicided.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She was real excited.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He gestured angry.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

All of us had an invite.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Them boys have sure been teasing the canine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Another thing to avoid is triteness. The English language teems with
phrases once strikingly original but now smooth-worn and vulgarized by
incessant repetition. It can scarcely be said that you are to shun these
altogether. Now and then you will find one of them coming happily as well
as handily into your speech. But you must not use them too often. Above
all, you must rid yourself of any dependence upon them. The scope of this
book permits only a few illustrations of the kinds of words and phrases
meant. But the person who speaks of "lurid flames," or "untiring efforts,"
or "specimens of humanity"—who "views with alarm," or has a "native
heath," or is "to the manner born"—does more than advertise the
scantness of his verbal resources. He brands himself mentally indolent; he
deprives his thought itself of all sharpness, exactness, and power.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Slovenliness III</p>
<p>Replace with more original expressions the trite phrases (italicized)
in the following sentences:</p>
<p><emphasis>Last but not least</emphasis>, we have <emphasis>in our midst</emphasis> one who began life
<emphasis>poor but honest</emphasis>.</p>
<p>After we had <emphasis>done justice to a dinner</emphasis> and gathered in the drawing
room, we listened <emphasis>with bated breath</emphasis> while she <emphasis>favored us with a

<p>We were <emphasis>doomed to disappointment; the grim reaper</emphasis> had already
gathered unto himself <emphasis>all that was mortal</emphasis> of our comrade.</p>
<p><emphasis>No sooner said than done</emphasis>. I soon found myself <emphasis>the proud

<p>The way my efforts were <emphasis>nipped in the bud</emphasis> simply <emphasis>beggars
description</emphasis>. I am somewhat <emphasis>the worse for wear. Hoping you are the
same</emphasis>, I remain Yours sincerely, Ned Burke.</p>
<p>Finally, to the extent that you use slang at all, be its master instead of
its slave. You have many times been told that the overuse of slang
disfigures one's speech and hampers his standing with cultivated people.
You have also been told that slang constantly changes, so that one's
accumulations of it today will be a profitless clutter tomorrow. These
things are true, but an even more cogent objection remains. Slang is
detrimental to the formation of good intellectual habits. From its very
nature it cannot be precise, cannot discriminate closely. It is a vehicle
for loose-thinking people, it is fraught with unconsidered general
meanings, it moves in a region of mental mists. It could not flourish as
it does were fewer of us content to express vague thoughts and feelings
instead of those which are sharply and specifically ours. Unless,
therefore, you wish your intellectual processes to be as hazy and
haphazard as those of mental shirkers and loafers, you must eschew, not
necessarily all slang, but all heedless, all habitual use of it. Now and
then a touch of slang, judiciously chosen, is effective; now and then it
fulfils a legitimate purpose of language. But normally you should express
yourself as befits one who has at his disposal the rich treasuries of the
dictionary instead of a mere stock of greasy counterfeit phrases.</p>
<p>EXERCISE - Slovenliness IV</p>
<p>Replace the following slang with acceptable English:</p>

<p>&lt;Wordiness&gt;</p>
<p>As a precaution against tameness you should cultivate spontaneity and
daring. As a precaution against slovenliness you should cultivate
freshness and accuracy. But to display spontaneity, daring, freshness,
accuracy you must have or acquire a large stock, a wide range, of words.
Now this possession, like any other, brings with it temptation. If we have
words, we like to use them. Nor do we wait for an indulgence in this
luxury until we have consciously set to work to amass a vocabulary.</p>
<p>Verbosity is, in truth, the besetting linguistic sin. Most people are
lavish with words, as most people are lavish with money. This is not to
say that in the currency of language they are rich. But even if they lack
the means—and the desire—to be extravagant, they yet make their
purchases heedlessly or fail to count their linguistic change. The degree
of our thrift, not the amount of our income or resources, is what marks us
as being or not being verbal spendthrifts. The frugal manager buys his
ideas at exactly the purchase price. He does not expend a twenty-dollar
bill for a box of matches.</p>
<p>Have words by all means, the more of them the better, but use them
temperately, sparingly. Do not think that a passage to be admirable must
be studded with ostentatious terms. Consider the Gettysburg Address or the
Parable of the Prodigal Son. These convey their thought and feeling
perfectly, yet both are simple—exquisitely simple. They strike us indeed
as being inevitable—as if their phrasing could not have been other than
it is. They have, they are, finality. What could glittering phraseology
add to them? Nothing; it could only mar them. Yet Lincoln and the
Scriptural writers were not afraid to use big words when occasion
required. What they sought was to make their speech adequate without
carrying a superfluous syllable.</p>
<p>"The sun set" is more natural and effective than "The celestial orb that
blesses our terrestrial globe with its warm and luminous rays sank to its
nocturnal repose behind the western horizon." Great writers—the true
masters—have often held "fine writing" and pretentious speaking up to
ridicule. Thus Shakespeare has Kent, who has been rebuked for his
bluntness, indulge in a grandiloquent outburst:</p>
<p>  "Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Under the allowance of your grand aspect,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  On flickering Phoebus' front,—"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>No wonder Kent is interrupted with a "What meanest by this?" Sometimes
great writers use ornate utterance for humorous effects. Thus Dickens
again and again has Mr. Micawber express a commonplace idea in sounding
terms which at length fail him, so that he must interject an "in short"
and summarize his meaning in a phrase amusing through its homely contrast.
But humor based on ponderous diction is too often wearisome. Better say
simply "He died," or colloquially "He kicked the bucket," than "He
propelled his pedal extremities with violence against the wooden pail
which is customarily employed in the transportation of the aquatic fluid."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Wordiness I</p>
<p>Express these ideas in simpler language:</p>
<p>The temperature was excessive.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The most youthful of his offspring was not remarkable for personal</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

pulchritude.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Henry Clay expressed a preference for being on the right side of public</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

questions to occupying the position of President of the United States of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

America.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He who passes at an accelerated pace may nevertheless be capable of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

perusing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A masculine member of the human race was mounted on an equine quadruped.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>But the number of the terms we employ, as well as their ostentatiousness,
must be considered. Most of us blunder around in the neighborhood of our
meaning instead of expressing it briefly and clearly. We throw a handful
of words at an idea when one word would suffice; we try to bring the idea
down with a shotgun instead of a rifle. Of course one means of correction
is that we should acquire accuracy, a quality already discussed. Another
is that we should practice condensation.</p>
<p>First, let us learn to omit the words which add nothing to the meaning.
Thus in the sentence "An important essential in cashing a check is that
you should indorse it on the back," several words or groups of words
needlessly repeat ideas which are expressed elsewhere. The sentence is as
complete in substance, and far terser in form, when it reads "An essential
in cashing a check is that you should indorse it."</p>
<p>Next, let us, when we may, reduce phrases and even clauses to a word. Thus
the clause at the beginning and the phrase at the close of the following
sentence constitute sheer verbiage: "Men who have let their temper get the
better of them are often in a mood to do harm to somebody." The sentence
tells us nothing that may not be told in five words: "Angry men are often
dangerous."</p>
<p>Finally, let us substitute phrases or clauses for unnecessary sentences.
The following series of independent assertions contains avoidable
repetitions: "One morning I was riding on the subway to my work. It was
always my custom to ride to my work on the subway. This morning I met
Harry Blake." The full thought may better be embodied in a single
sentence: "One morning, while I was, as usual, riding on the subway to my
work, I met Harry Blake."</p>
<p>By applying these instructions to any page at hand—one from your own
writing, one from a letter some friend has sent you, one from a book or
magazine—you will often be able to strike out many of the words without
at all impairing the meaning. Another means of acquiring succinct
expression is to practice the composition of telegrams and cable messages.
You will of course lessen the cost by eliminating every word that can
possibly be spared. On the other hand, you must bear it in mind that your
punctuation will not be transmitted, and that the recipient must be
absolutely safeguarded against reading together words meant to be
separated or separating words meant to be read together. That is, your
message must be both concise and unmistakably clear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Wordiness II</p>
<p>1. Condense the editorial (Appendix 1) by eliminating unnecessary words
and finding briefer equivalents for roundabout expressions.</p>
<p>2. Try to condense similarly the Parable of the Sower (Appendix 3) and the
Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4). (The task will largely or altogether
baffle you, but will involve minute study of tersely written passages.)</p>
<p>3. Condense the following:</p>
<p>A man whose success in life was due solely to his own efforts rose in his
place and addressed the man who presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>A girl who sat in the seat behind me giggled in an irritating manner.</p>
<p>We heard the wild shriek of the locomotive. Any sound in that savage
region seemed more terrible than it would in civilized surroundings. So as
we listened to the shriek of the locomotive, it sounded terrible too.</p>
<p>I heard what kind of chauffeur he was. A former employer of his told me.
He was a chauffeur who speeded in reckless fashion because he was fond of
having all the excitement possible.</p>
<p>4. Condense the following into telegrams of ten words or less:</p>
<p>Arrived here in Toledo yesterday morning talked with the directors found
them not hostile to us but friendly.</p>
<p>Detectives report they think evidence now points to innocence of man
arrested and to former employee as the burglar.</p>
<p>5. The following telegrams are ambiguous. Clarify them.</p>
<p>Jane escaped illness I feared Charley better.</p>
<p>Buy oil if market falls sell cotton.</p>
<p>6. Base a telegraphic night letter of not more than fifty words
upon these circumstances:</p>
<p>(a) You have been sent to buy, if possible and as cheaply as possible, a
majority of the stock in a given company. You find that many of the
stockholders distrust or dislike the president and are willing to sell.
Some of these ask only $50 a share for their holdings; the owners of 100
shares want as much as $92; the average price asked is $76. By buying out
all the president's enemies, which you can now do beyond question, you
would secure a bare majority of the stock. But $92 a share seems to you
excessive; that is, you think that by working quietly among the
president's friends you can get 100 shares at $77 or thereabouts and thus
save approximately $1500. On the other hand, should your dealings with the
friends of the president give him premature warning, he might stop the
sales by these friends and himself begin buying from his enemies, and thus
make your purchase of a majority of the stock impossible. Is the $1500 you
would save worth the risk you would be obliged to take? You call for
instructions.</p>
<p>(b) You are telegraphing a metropolitan paper the results of a
Congressional election. Philput, the Republican candidate, leads in the
cities, from which returns are now complete. Wilkins, the Democratic
candidate, leads in the country, from only certain districts of which—
those nearest the cities—returns have been heard. If the present
proportionate division of the rural vote is maintained for the total,
Philput will be elected by a plurality of three hundred votes. Philput
asserts that the proportions will hold. Wilkins points out, however, that
he is relatively stronger in the more remote districts and predicts that
he will have a plurality of seven hundred votes. Smallbridge, an
independent candidate, is apparently making a better race in the country
than in the city, but he is so weak in both places that the ballots cast
for him can scarcely affect the outcome unless the margin of victory is
infinitesimal.</p>
<p>7. Compress 6a and 6b each into a telegram of not more than ten words.</p>
<p>8. (Do not read this assignment until you have composed the night letters
and telegrams called for in 6 and 7.) Compare your first night letter in 6
and your first telegram in 7 with the versions given below. Decide where
you have surpassed these versions, where you have fallen short of them.</p>
<p><emphasis>Night letter</emphasis>: Two factions in company I can buy from enemies
president bare majority stock at average seventy-six but hundred of these
shares held at ninety-two I could probably get hundred quietly from
friends president about seventy-seven but president might detect move and
buy majority stock himself wire instructions. (Fifty words.)</p>
<p><emphasis>Telegram</emphasis>: Wire whether buy safe or risk control saving fifteen
hundred. (Ten words.)</p>
<p>A final device for escaping wordiness you will have discovered for
yourself while composing telegrams and telegraphic night letters. It is to
pass over details not vital to your purpose. Of course you must have due
regard for circumstances; details needed for one purpose may be
superfluous for another. But all of us are familiar with the person who
loses her ideas in a rigmarole of prosaic and irrelevant facts. Such a
person is Shakespeare's scatter-brained Dame Quickly. On one occasion this
voluble woman is shrilly reproaching Sir John Falstaff for his
indebtedness to her. "What is the gross sum that I owe thee?" he inquires.
She might answer simply: "If thou wert an honest man, thyself and the
money too. Thou didst promise to marry me. Deny it if thou canst."
Instead, she plunges into a prolix recital of the circumstances of the
engagement, so that the all-important fact that the engagement exists has
no special emphasis in her welter of words. "If thou wert an honest man,"
she cries, "thyself and the money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a
parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber, at the round table, by
a sea-coal fire, upon Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke thy
head for liking his father to a singing-man of Windsor, thou didst swear
to me then, as I was washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady
thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife Keech, the butcher's wife,
come in then and call me gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of
vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns; whereby thou didst
desire to eat some, whereby I told thee they were ill for a green wound?
And didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs, desire me to be no more
so familiarity with such poor people; saying that ere long they should
call me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me fetch thee thirty
shillings? I put thee now to thy book-oath; deny it if thou canst."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Wordiness III</p>
<p>1. Study the following paragraph, decide which ideas are important,
and strike out the details that merely clog the thought:</p>
<p>As I stepped into the room, I heard the clock ticking and that caused me
to look at it. It sits on the mantelpiece with some layers of paper under
one corner where the mantel is warped. When the papers slip out or we move
the clock a little as we're dusting, the ticking stops right away. Of
course the clock's not a new one at all, but it's an old one. It has been
in the family for many a long year, yes, from even before my father's
time. Let me see, it was bought by my grandfather. No, it couldn't have
been grandfather that bought it; it was his brother. Oh, yes, I remember
now; my mother told me all about it, and I'd forgotten what she said till
this minute. But really my grandfather's brother didn't exactly buy it. He
just traded for it. He gave two pigs and a saddle, that's what my mother
said. You see, he was afraid his hogs might take cholera and so he wanted
to get rid of them; and as for the saddle, he had sold his riding-horse
and he didn't have any more use for that. Well, it isn't a valuable clock,
like a grandfather clock or anything of that sort, though it is antique.
As I was saying, when I glanced at it, it read seven minutes to six. I
remember the time very well, for just then the factory whistle blew and I
remember saying to myself: "It's seven minutes slow today." You see, it's
old and we don't keep it oiled, and so it's always losing time. Hardly a
day passes but I set it up—sometimes twice a day, as for the matter of
that—and I usually go by the factory whistle too, though now and then I
go by Dwight's gold watch. Well, anyhow, that tells me what time it was.
I'm certain I can't be wrong.</p>
<p>2. Study, on the other hand, The Castaway (Appendix 5) for its judicious
use of details. Defoe in his stories is a supreme master of verisimilitude
(likeness to truth). As we read him, we cannot help believing that these
things actually happened. More than in anything else the secret of his
lifelikeness lies in his constant faithfulness to reality. He puts in the
little mishaps that would have befallen a man so situated, the things he
would have done, the difficulties he might have avoided had he exercised
forethought. Though Defoe had little insight into the complexities of
man's inner life, he has not been surpassed in his accumulations of
naturalistic outer details. These do not cumber his narrative; they
contribute to its purpose and add to its effectiveness. In this selection
(Appendix 5) observe how plausible are such homely details as Crusoe's
seeing no sign of his comrades "except three of their hats, one cap, and
two shoes that were not fellows"; as his difficulty in getting aboard the
ship again; and as his having his clothes washed away by the rising of the
tide. Find half a dozen other such incidents that You consider especially
effective.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Verbal Discords&gt;</p>
<p>We may pitch our talk or our writing in almost any key we choose. Our
mood may be dreamy or eager or hilarious or grim or blustering or somber
or bantering or scornful or satirical or whatever we will. But once we
have established the tone, we should not—except sometimes for broadly
humorous effects—change it needlessly or without clear forewarning. If we
do, we create one or the other of two obstacles, or both of them, for
whoever is trying to follow what we say. In the first place, we obscure
our meaning. For example, we have been speaking ironically and suddenly
swerve into serious utterance; or we have been speaking seriously and then
incongruously adopt an ironic tone. How are our listeners, our readers to
take us? They are puzzled; they do not know. In the second place, we
offend—perhaps in insidious, indefinable fashion—the esthetic
proprieties; we violate the natural fitness of things. For example, we
have been speaking with colloquial freedom, sprinkling our discourse with
<emphasis>shouldn't</emphasis> and <emphasis>won't;</emphasis> suddenly we become formal and say
<emphasis>should not</emphasis> and <emphasis>will not</emphasis>. Our meaning is as obvious as
before, but the verbal harmony has been interrupted; our hearers or
readers are uneasily aware of a break in the unity of tone.</p>
<p>A speaker or writer is a host to verbal guests. When he invites them to
his assembly, he gives each the tacit assurance that it will not be
brought into fellowship with those which in one or another of a dozen
subtle ways will be uncongenial company for it. He must never be forgetful
of this unspoken promise. If he is to avoid a linguistic breach, he must
constantly have his wits about him; must study out his combinations
carefully, and use all his knowledge, all his tact. He will make due use
of spontaneous impulse; but that this may be wise and disciplined, he will
form the habit of curiosity about words, their stations, their savor,
their aptitudes, their limitations, their outspokenness, their reticences,
their affinities and antipathies. Thus when he has need of a phrase to
fill out a verbal dinner party, he will know which one to select.</p>
<p>Certain broad classifications of words are manifest even to the most
obtuse user of English. <emphasis>Shady</emphasis>, <emphasis>behead</emphasis>, and <emphasis>lying</emphasis> are
"popular" words, while their synonyms <emphasis>umbrageous,</emphasis> decapitate,_
and <emphasis>mendacious</emphasis> are "learned" words. <emphasis>Flabbergasted</emphasis> and
<emphasis>higgledy-piggledy</emphasis> are "colloquial," while <emphasis>roseate</emphasis> and
<emphasis>whilom</emphasis> are "literary." <emphasis>Affidavit</emphasis>, <emphasis>allegro</emphasis>, <emphasis>lee shore</emphasis>,
and <emphasis>pinch hit</emphasis> are "technical," while <emphasis>vamp</emphasis>, <emphasis>savvy</emphasis>, <emphasis>bum
hunch</emphasis>, and <emphasis>skiddoo</emphasis> are "slang." It would be disenchanting
indeed were extremes of this sort brought together. But offenses of a less
glaring kind are as hard to shut out as February cold from a heated house.
Unusual are the speeches or compositions, even the short ones, in which
every word is in keeping, is in perfect tune with the rest.</p>
<p>For the attainment of this ultimate verbal decorum we should have to
possess knowledge almost unbounded, together with unerring artistic
instinct. But diction of a kind only measurably inferior to this is
possible to us if we are in earnest. To attain it we must study the
difference between abstract and concrete terms, and let neither intrude
unadvisedly upon the presence or functions of the other; do the same by
literal and figurative terms and instruct ourselves in the nature and
significance of connotation.</p>
<p>Before considering these more detailed matters, however, we may pause for
a general exercise on verbal harmony.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Discords</p>
<p>1. Study the editorial in Appendix 1 for unforewarned changes in mood and
assemblages of mutually uncongenial words. Rewrite the worst two
paragraphs to remove all blemishes of these kinds.</p>
<p>2. Compare Burke's speech (Appendix 2) with Defoe's narrative (Appendix 5)
for the difference in tone between them. Does each keep the tone it adopts
(that is, except for desirable changes)?</p>
<p>3. Note the changes in tone in the Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4). Do the
changes in substance make these changes in tone desirable?</p>
<p>4. In the following passages, make such changes and omissions as are
necessary to unify the tone:</p>
<p>How I loved to stroll, on those long Indian summer afternoons, into the
quiet meadows where the mild-breathed kine were grazing! An old cow that
switches her tail at flies and puts her foot in the bucket when you milk
her, I absolutely loathe. How I loved to hear the birds sing, to listen to
the fall of ripe autumnal apples!</p>
<p>It wasn't the girl yclept Sally. This girl was not so vivacious as Sally,
but she had a mug on her that was a lot less ugly to look at. Gee, when
she stood there in front of me with those mute, ineffable, sympathetic
eyes of hers, I was ready to throw a duck-fit.</p>

<p>&lt;I. Abstract vs. Concrete Terms; General vs. Specific Terms&gt;</p>
<p>Abstract terms convey ideas; concrete terms call up pictures. If we say
"Honesty is the best policy," we speak abstractly. Nobody can see or hear
or touch the thing <emphasis>honesty</emphasis> or the thing <emphasis>policy</emphasis>; the
apprehension of them must be purely intellectual. But if we say "The
rat began to gnaw the rope," we speak concretely. <emphasis>Rat</emphasis>, <emphasis>gnaw</emphasis>,
and <emphasis>rope</emphasis> are tangible, perceptible things; the words bring to us
visions of particular objects and actions.</p>
<p>Now when we engage in explanations and discussions of principles,
theories, broad social topics, and the like—when we expound, moralize, or
philosophize,—our subject matter is general. We approach our readers or
hearers on the thinking, the rational side of their natures. Our
phraseology is therefore normally abstract. But when, on the other hand,
we narrate an event or depict an appearance, our subject matter is
specific. We approach our readers or hearers on the sensory or emotional
side of their natures. Our phraseology is therefore normally concrete.</p>
<p>You should be able to express yourself according to either method. You
should be able to choose the words best suited to make people understand;
also to choose the words best suited to make people realize vividly and
feel. Now to some extent you will adopt the right method by intuition. But
if you do not reinforce your intuition with a careful study of words, you
will vacillate from one method to the other and strike crude discords of
phrasing. Of course if you switch methods intelligently and of purpose,
that is quite another matter. An abstract discussion may be enlivened by a
concrete illustration. A concrete narrative or portrayal may be given
weight and rationalized by generalization. Moreover many things lie on the
borderland between the two domains and may properly be attached to either.
Thus the abstraction is legitimate when you say or write: "A man wishes to
acquire the comforts and luxuries, as well as the necessaries, of life."
The concreteness is likewise legitimate when you say or write: "John Smith
wishes to earn cake as well as bread and butter."</p>
<p>In most instances general terms are the same as abstract, and specific the
same as concrete. Some subtle discriminations may, however, be made. Of
these the only one that need concern us here is that the wording of a
passage may not be abstract and yet be general. Suppose, for example, you
were telling the story of the prodigal son and should say: "He was very
hungry, and could not obtain food anywhere. When he had come to his
senses, he thought, 'I should be better off at home.'" This language is
not abstract, but it is general rather than specific. When Jesus told the
story, he wished to put the situation as poignantly as possible and
therefore avoided both abstract and general terms: "And he would fain have
filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat: and no man gave
unto him. And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of
my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!"
Many a person who shuns abstractions and talks altogether of the concrete
things of life, yet traps out circumstance in general rather than specific
terms. To do this is always to sacrifice force.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Abstract</p>
<p>1. Discuss as abstractly as possible such topics as those listed in
Activity 1 for EXERCISE - Discourse, or as the following:</p>
<p>Is there any such thing as luck?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is the Golden Rule practicable in the modern business world?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is modesty rather than self-assertion regarding his own merits and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

abilities the better policy for an employee?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are substantial, home-keeping girls or girls rather fast and frivolous the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

more likely to obtain good husbands?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is it desirable for a young man to take out life insurance?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is self-education better than collegiate training?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should one always tell the truth?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. Discuss as concretely as possible the topics you have selected from 1.
Use illustrations drawn from life.</p>
<p>3. Restate in concrete terms such generalizations as the following:</p>
<p>Experience is the best teacher.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Self-preservation is the first law of nature.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To him who in the love of nature holds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Communion with her visible forms, she speaks</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A various language.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Necessity is the mother of invention.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The bravest are the tenderest.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pride goeth before destruction.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The evil that men do lives after them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>4. Compare the abstract statement "Truths and high ethical principles are
received by various men in various ways" with the concrete presentation of
the same idea in Appendix 3. Which expression of the thought would be the
more easily understood by the average person? Why? Which would you
yourself remember the longer? Why?</p>
<p>5. Compare the statement "The second period of a human being's life is
that of his reluctant attendance at school" with Shakespeare's picture of
the schoolboy in Appendix 4.</p>
<p>6. Burke, near the close of his speech (Appendix 2), presents an idea,
first in general terms, and then in specific terms, thus: "No contrivance
can prevent the effect of…distance in weakening government. Seas roll,
and months pass, between the order and the execution, and the want of a
speedy explanation of a single point is enough to defeat a whole system."
Find elsewhere in Burke's speech and in the editorial (Appendix I) general
assertions which may be made more forceful by restatement in specific
terms, and supply these specific restatements.</p>
<p>7. State in your own words the general thought or teaching of the Parable
of the Prodigal Son. (<emphasis>Luke</emphasis> 15: 11-24.)</p>
<p>8. Make the following statements more concrete:</p>
<p>In front of our house was a tree that at a certain season of the year
displayed highly colored foliage.</p>
<p>A celebrated orator said: "Give me liberty, or give me death!"</p>
<p>On the table were some viands that assailed my nostrils agreeably and
others that put into my mouth sensations of anticipated enjoyment.</p>
<p>From this window above the street I can hear a variety of noises by day
and a variety of different noises by night.</p>
<p>As he groped through the pitch-dark room he could feel many articles of
furniture.</p>
<p>9. State in general terms the thought of the following sentences:</p>
<p>A burnt child dreads the fire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A stitch in time saves nine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A cat may look at a king.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A barking dog never bites.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If two men ride a horse, one must ride behind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stone walls do not a prison make.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A merry heart goes all the day.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the twig is bent, so the tree is inclined.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>10. Describe a town as seen from a particular point of view, or at a
particular time of day, or under particular atmospheric conditions. Make
your description as concrete as possible.</p>
<p>11. Compare your description with this from Stevenson: "The town came down
the hill in a cascade of brown gables, bestridden by smooth white roofs,
and spangled here and there with lighted windows." Stevenson's sentence
contains twenty-five words. How many of them are "color" words? How many
"motion" words? How many of the first twenty-five words in your
description appeal to one or another of the five senses?</p>
<p>12. Narrate as vividly as possible an experience in your own life. Compare
what you have written with the account of Crusoe's escape to the island
(Appendix 5). Which narrative is the more concrete? How much?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;2. Literal vs. Figurative Terms&gt;</p>
<p>Phraseology is literal when it says exactly what it means; is figurative
when it says one thing, but really means another. Thus "He fought bravely"
is literal; "He was a lion in the fight" is figurative. Literal
phraseology as a rule appeals to our scientific or understanding
faculties; figurative to our emotional faculties. Here again, as with
abstraction and concreteness, you should learn to express yourself by
either method.</p>
<p>Both have their advantages and their drawbacks. We all admire the man who
has observed, and can state, accurately. It is upon this belief of ours in
the literal that Defoe shrewdly traffics. (See Appendix 5.) He does not
stir us as some writers do, but he gains our implicit confidence. Dame
Quickly, on the contrary, makes egregious use of the literal. (See
paragraph above EXERCISE - Wordiness III above.) Her facts are accurate,
yes; but how strictly, how unsparingly accurate! And how many of them are
beside the point! She quite convinces us that the devotee of the literal
may be dull.</p>
<p>An advantage of the figurative also is that it may make meanings lucid.
Thus when Burke near the close of his discussion (Appendix 2) wishes to
make it clear that by a law of nature the authority of extensive empires
is slighter in its more remote territories, he has recourse to a figure of
speech: "In large bodies, the circulation of power must be less vigorous
at the extremities. Nature has said it." More often, however, the function
of the figurative is to drive home a thought or a mood of which a mere
statement would leave us unmoved—to make us <emphasis>feel</emphasis> it. Thus Burke
said of the Americans "Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and
attached on this specific point of taxing." He added: "Here they felt its
pulse, and as they found that beat they thought themselves sick or sound."
Had you been one of his Parliamentary hearers, would not that second
sentence have made more real and more important the colonial attitude to
taxation? The poets of course make frequent and noble use of the
figurative. This is how Coleridge tells us that the descent of a tropical
night is sudden:</p>
<p>  "The sun's rim dips; the stars rush out;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  At one stride comes the dark."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The words <emphasis>rush out</emphasis> and <emphasis>at one stride comes</emphasis> convert the stars
and the darkness into vast beings or at least vast personal forces; the
comparisons are so natural as to seem inevitable; we are transported to
the very scene and feel the overwhelming abruptness of the nightfall. But
if a figure of speech seems artificial, if it is strained or far-fetched
or merely decorative, it subtracts from the effectiveness of the passage.
Thus when Tennyson says:</p>
<p>  "When the breeze of a joyful dawn blew free</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  In the silken sail of infancy."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>we must stop and ponder before we perceive that what he means is "When I
was a happy child." The figure is like an exotic plant rather than a
natural outgrowth of the soil; it appears to us something thought up and
stuck on; it is a parasite rather than a helper.</p>
<p>Of course, as with abstraction and concreteness, you should develop
facility in gliding from literalness to figurativeness and back again. But
you are always to remember that your gymnastics are not to militate
against verbal concord. You must never set words scowling and growling at
each other through injudicious combinations like this: "She was five feet,
four and three-quarter inches high, had a small, round scar between her
nose and her left cheek-bone, and moved with the lissom and radiant grace
of a queen."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Literal</p>
<p>1. Give the specifications for a house you intend to build.</p>
<p>2. Make a list of comparisons (as to a nest, a haven, a goal) to show what
such a house might mean in the life of a man. Expand as many of these
comparisons as you can, but do not carry the process to absurd lengths.
(In the figure of the nest you may mention the parent birds, their
activities, the nestlings; in the figure of the haven you may mention the
quiet, sheltered waters in contrast to the turbulent billows outside; in
the figure of the goal you may mention the struggle necessary to reach
it.)</p>
<p>3. Describe the looks of the house. Use as many figures of speech as you
can. If you can find no appropriate figures, at least make your words
specific.</p>
<p>4. Give a surveyor's or a tax assessor's or a conveyancer's description of
a piece of land. Then describe the land through figures of speech which
will vivify its outward appearance or its emotional significance to the
owner.</p>
<p>5. Observe that the Parable of the Sower (Appendix 3) is an extended
figure of speech. Is the main figure effective? Are its detailed
applications effective?</p>
<p>6. The Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4) is also an extended figure of
speech. Does it, as Shakespeare intends, bring vividly to your
consciousness the course, motives, stages, evolution of a human being's
life? There are several subsidiary figures. Do these add force,
definiteness to the picture Shakespeare is drawing at that moment?</p>
<p>7. Observe from Appendix 3, Appendix 4, and the sentences listed in
Activity 9 for EXERCISE - Abstract above, that a thing meant to be
concrete is likely to be stated figuratively.</p>
<p>8. Examine The Castaway (Appendix 5) for its proportionate use of literal
and figurative elements. See Activity 2 of EXERCISE - Wordiness III above
for a statement of Defoe's purpose. Could he have effected this purpose so
well had he employed more figures of speech?</p>
<p>9. Examine Appendix 2 for its use of figures. Are the figures appropriate
to the subject matter? Are there enough of them?</p>
<p>10. Galvanize the thought of any sentence or paragraph in editorial
(Appendix 1) by the use of a figure of speech.</p>
<p>11. Summarize or illustrate your opinion on any of the topics listed in
Activity 1 for EXERCISE - Discourse, through the employment of figure of
speech.</p>
<p>12. Are these figures effective?</p>
<p>Man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The flower of our young manhood is scaling the ladder of success.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  Fair as a star, when only one</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

  Many thoughts of trouble come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Like to flies upon a plum!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Let me tell you first about those barnacles that clog the wheels of
society by poisoning the springs of rectitude with their upas-like eye.</p>
<p>  The day is done, and the darkness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Falls from the wings of night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  As a feather is wafted downward</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  From an eagle in his flight.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will fear no evil.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  Life, like a dome of many-colored glass,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Stains the white radiance of eternity.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Mountains stood out like pimples or lay like broken welts
across the habitable ground.</p>
<p>  Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And then is heard no more; it is a tale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Signifying nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I saw him in Russia, where the infantry of the snow and the cavalry of the
wild blast scattered his legions like winter's withered leaves.</p>
<p>13. Recast the following sentences to eliminate the clashing of literal
and figurative elements:</p>
<p>Life is like a rich treasure entrusted to us, and to sustain it we must
have three square meals a day.</p>
<p>She glanced at the mirror, but did not really see herself. She was trying
to puzzle out the right course, and could only see as through a glass
darkly.</p>
<p>Arming himself with the sword of zeal and the buckler of integrity, he
wrote the letter.</p>
<p>He swept the floor every morning, and was a ray of sunshine in the office.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He also emptied the waste baskets and cleaned the cuspidors.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>&lt;3. Connotation&gt;</p>
<p>The connotation of a word is the subtle implication, the emotional
association it carries—often quite apart from its dictionary definition.
Thus the words <emphasis>house</emphasis> and <emphasis>home</emphasis> in large measure overlap in
meaning, but emotionally they are not equivalents at all. You can say
<emphasis>house</emphasis> without experiencing any sensation whatever, but if you utter
the word <emphasis>home</emphasis> it will call back, however slightly, tender and
cherished recollections. <emphasis>Bald heads</emphasis> and <emphasis>gray hair</emphasis> are both
indicative of age; but you would pronounce the former in disparaging
allusion to elderly persons, and the latter with sentiments of veneration.
You would say, of a clodpole that he plays the <emphasis>fiddle</emphasis>, but of Fritz
Kreisler that he plays the <emphasis>violin</emphasis>. And just as you unconsciously
adapt words to feelings in these obvious instances, you must learn, on
peril of striking false notes verbally, to do so when distinctions are
less gross.</p>
<p>Moreover circumstance as well as sentiment may control the connotation of
a word. A word or phrase may have a double or triple connotation, and
depend upon vocal inflection, upon gesture, upon the words with which it
is linked, upon the experience of speaker or hearer, upon time, place, and
external fact, or upon other forces outside it for the sense in which it
is to be taken. You may be called "old dog" in an insulting manner, or
(especially if a slap on the shoulder accompanies the phrase) in an
affectionate manner. You may properly say, "Calhoun had logic on his
side"; add, however, the words "but his face was to the past," and you
spoil the sentence,—for <emphasis>face</emphasis> gives a reflex connotation to
<emphasis>side</emphasis>, slight perhaps and momentary, but disconcerting. Think over
the funny stories you have heard. Many of them turn, you will find, on the
outcropping of new significance in a phrase because of its environment.
Thus the anecdote of the servant who had been instructed to summon the
visiting English nobleman by tapping on his bedroom door and inquiring,
"My lord, have you yet risen?" and who could only stammer, "My God! ain't
you up yet?" Or the anecdote of the minister who in a sermon on the
Parable of the Prodigal Son told how a young man living dissolutely in a
city had been compelled to send to the pawnbroker first his overcoat, next
his suit, next his silk shirt, and finally his very underclothing—"and
then," added the minister, "he came to himself." Only by unresting
vigilance can you evade verbal discords, if not of this magnitude, at
least of much frequency and stylistic harm.</p>

<p>2. Make a list of your own similar to that in Exercise 1.</p>
<p>3. Read the sentences listed in EXERCISE - Slovenliness III and IV. What
do these sentences suggest to you as to the social and mental
qualifications of the person who employs them?</p>
<p>4. Read the second paragraph of Appendix 2. What does it suggest to you as
to Burke's social and mental qualifications?</p>

following expressions: "mewling and puking," "whining schoolboy,"
"satchel," "sighing like furnace," "round belly," "spectacles on nose,"
"shrunk shank," "sans [without] teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans
everything." Would you believe the passage is poetry?—that its total

<p><strong>    WORDS IN COMBINATION: HOW MASTERED</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The more dangerous pitfalls for those who use words in combination—as all
of us do—have been pointed out. The best ways of avoiding these pitfalls
have also been indicated. But our work together has thus far been chiefly
negative. To be sure, many tasks assigned for your performance have been
constructive as well as precautionary; but <emphasis>the end</emphasis> held ever before
you has been the avoidance of feeble or ridiculous diction. In the present
chapter we must take up those aspects of the mastery of words in
combination which are primarily positive.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Preliminaries: General Purposes and Methods&gt;</p>
<p>Before coming to specific aspects and assignments, however, we shall do
well to consider certain large general purposes and methods.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;I. A Ready, an Accurate, or a Wide Vocabulary?&gt;</p>
<p>First, what kind of vocabulary do we wish to acquire? A facile, readily
used one? An accurate one? Or one as nearly as may be comprehensive? The
three kinds do not necessarily coexist. The possession of one may even
hinder and retard the acquisition of another. Thus if we seek a ready
vocabulary, an accurate vocabulary may cause us to halt and hesitate for
words which shall correspond with the shadings of our thought and emotion,
and a wide vocabulary may embarrass us with the plenitude of our verbal
riches.</p>
<p>But <emphasis>may</emphasis> is not <emphasis>must</emphasis>. Though the three kinds of vocabulary
may interfere with each other, there is no reason, except superficially,
why they should. Our purpose should be, therefore, to acquire not a single
kind but all three. We should be like the boy who, when asked whether he
would have a small slice of apple pie or a small slice of pumpkin pie,
replied resolutely, "Thank you, I will take a large piece of both."</p>
<p>That the assignments in this chapter may help you develop a vocabulary
which shall be promptly responsive to your needs, you should perform some
of them rapidly. Your thoughts and feelings regarding a topic may be
anything but clear, but you must not pause to clarify them. The words best
suited to the matter may not be instantly available, but you must not
tarry for accessions of language. Stumble, flounder if you must, yea,
rearrange your ideas even as you present them, but press resolutely ahead,
comforting yourself with the assurance that in the heat and stress of
circumstances a man rarely does his work precisely as he wishes. When you
have finished the discussion, repeat it immediately—and with no more
loitering than before. You will find that your ideas have shifted and
enlarged, and that more appropriate words have become available. Further
repetitions will assist you the more. But the goal you should set
yourself, as you proceed from topic to topic, is the attainment of the
power to be at your best in the first discussion. You may never reach this
goal, but at least you may approach it.</p>
<p>That the assignments in this chapter may assist you in making your
vocabulary accurate, you should perform some of them in another way. When
you have selected a topic, you should first of all think it through. In
doing this, arrange your ideas as consistently and logically as you can,
and test them with your reason. Then set them forth in language which
shall be lucid and exact. Tolerate no slipshod diction, no vaguely
rendered general meanings. Send every sentence, every word like a skilful
drop-kick—straight above the crossbar. When you have done your best with
the topic, lay it by for a space. Time is a great revealer of hidden
defects, and you must not regard your labors as ended until your
achievement is the maturest possible for you. If the quantity of what you
accomplish is meager, suffer no distress on that account. The desideratum
now is not quantity, but quality.</p>
<p>The assignments in this chapter will do less toward making your vocabulary
wide than toward making it facile and precise. To be sure, they will now
and then set you to hunting for words that are new. Better still, they
will give you a mastery over some of your outlying words—words known to
your eyes or ears but not to your tongue. But these advantages will be
somewhat incidental. Means for the systematic extension of your verbal
domain into regions as yet unexplored by you, are reserved for the later
chapters of this book.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;2. A Vocabulary for Speech or for Writing?&gt;</p>
<p>In the second place, are we to develop a vocabulary for oral discourse or
a vocabulary for writing? It may be that our chief impediment or our chief
ambition lies in one field rather than in the other. Nevertheless we
should strive for a double mastery; we ought to speak well <emphasis>and</emphasis>
write well. Indeed the two powers so react upon each other that we ought
to cultivate both for the sake of either. True, some men, though inexpert
as writers, have made themselves proficient as speakers; or though
shambling and ineffective as speakers, have made themselves proficient as
writers. But this is not natural or normal. Moreover these men might have
gleaned more abundantly from their chosen field had they not shut it off
from the acres adjacent. Fences waste space and curtail harvests.</p>
<p>The assignments in this chapter are of such a nature that you may perform
them either orally or in writing. You should speak and write alternately,
sometimes on the same topic, sometimes on topics taken in rotation.</p>
<p>In your oral discussions you should perhaps absent yourself at first from
human auditors. A bedstead or a dresser will not make you self-conscious
or in any way distract your attention, and it will permit you to sit down
afterward and think out the degree of your failure or success. Ultimately,
of course, you must speak to human beings—in informal conversations at
the outset, in more ambitious ways later as occasion permits.</p>
<p>In your writing you may find it advantageous to make preliminary outlines
of what you wish to say. But above all, you must be willing to blot, to
revise, to take infinite pains. You should remember the old admonition
that easy reading is devilish hard writing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;The Mastery of Words in Combination&gt;</p>
<p>These purposes and methods are general. We now come to the specific fields
in which we may with profit cultivate words in combination. Of these
fields there are four.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;I. Mastery through Translation&gt;</p>
<p>If you read a foreign language, whether laboriously or with ease, you
should make this power assist you to amass a good English vocabulary.
Take compositions or parts of compositions written in the foreign tongue,
and turn them into idiomatic English. How much you should translate
at a given time depends upon your leisure and your adeptness. Employ all
the methods—the spontaneous, the carefully perfected, the oral, the
written—heretofore explained in this chapter. In your final work on a
passage you should aim at a faultless rendition, and should spend time and
ransack the lexicons rather than come short of this ideal.</p>
<p>The habit of translation is an excellent habit to keep up. For the study
of an alien tongue not only improves your English, but has compensations
in itself.</p>
<p>EXERCISE - Translation</p>
<p>1. Translate from any accessible book in the foreign language you can
read.</p>
<p>2. Subscribe for a period of at least two or three months for a newspaper
or magazine in that language, if it is a modern one. Translate as before,
but give most of your time to rapid oral translation for a real or
imaginary American hearer.</p>
<p>3. When you have completed your final written translation of a passage
from the foreign language, make yourself master of all the English words
you have not previously (1) known or (2) used, but have encountered in
your work of translation.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>&lt;2. Mastery through Paraphrasing&gt;</p>
<p>It may be that you are not familiar with a foreign language. At any rate
you have some knowledge of English. Put this knowledge to use in
paraphrasing; for thus you will enrich your vocabulary and make it surer
and more flexible. The process of paraphrasing is simple, though the
actual work is not easy. You take passages written in English—the more of
them the better, and the more diversified the better—and both reproduce
their substance and incarnate their mood in words you yourself shall
choose.</p>
<p>You may have a passage before you and paraphrase it unit by unit. More
often, however, you should follow the plan adopted by Franklin when he
emulated Addison by rewriting the <emphasis>Spectator Papers</emphasis>. That is, you
should steep yourself in the thought and emotion of a piece of writing,
and then lay the piece aside until its wording has faded from your memory,
when you should reëmbody the substance in language that seems to you
natural and fitting. Much of the benefit will come from your comparing
your version, as Franklin did his, with the original. When you perceive
that you have fallen short, you should consider the respects wherein your
inferiority lies—and should make another attempt, and yet another, and
another. When you perceive that in any way you have surpassed the
original, you should feel a just pride in your achievement—and should
resolve that next time your cause for pride shall be greater still. Even
after you have desisted from formal paraphrasing, you should cling to the
habit, formed at this time, of observing any notable felicities in
whatever you read and of comparing them with the expression you yourself
would likely have employed.</p>
<p>EXERCISE - Paraphrasing</p>
<p>1. Paraphrase the editorial in Appendix 1. You should improve upon the
original. Keep trying until you do.</p>
<p>2. Paraphrase the second paragraph in Burke's speech (Appendix 2). Burke
lacked the cheap tricks of the ordinary orator, but his discussions were
based upon a comprehensive knowledge of facts, a sympathetic understanding
of human nature, a vast depth and range of thought, and a well-meditated
political philosophy. In short, he is a model for <emphasis>elaborated</emphasis>
discussions. Set forth the leading thought of this paragraph; you can give
it in fewer words than he employs. But try setting it forth with his full
accompaniments of reflection and information; you will be bewildered at
his crowding so much into such small compass.</p>
<p>3. Try to rival the pregnant conciseness of the Parable of the Sower
(Appendix 3).</p>
<p>4. Paraphrase in prose the Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4). Catch if
possible the mood, the "atmosphere," of each of the pictures painted by
Shakespeare. Condense your paraphrase as much as you can.</p>
<p>5. In each of the preceding exercises compare your vocabulary with that of
the original as to size, precision, and the grace and ease with which
words are put together. Does the original employ terms unfamiliar to you?
If so, look up their meaning and make them yours; then observe, when you
next paraphrase the passage, whether your mastery of these terms has
improved your expression.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;3. Mastery through Discourse at First Hand&gt;</p>
<p>Models have their use, but you can also work without models. It is
imperative that you should. You must learn to discuss, explain, analyze,
argue, narrate, and describe for yourself. Here again you should diversify
your materials to the utmost, not only that you may become well-rounded
and versatile in your ability to set forth ideas and feelings in words,
but also that your knowledge and your sensibility may receive stimulation.</p>
<p>It is feasible to begin by discussing or explaining. Most of the
intercourse conducted through language consists in either discussion or
explanation. Analysis, ordinarily, is almost ignored. Argument is indulged
in, and so is description (though less freely), but they are of the
bluntest and broadest. Narration—the recounting of incidents of everyday
existence—is, however, widely employed.</p>
<p>In your work of discussion or explanation you may seize upon any current
topic—industrial, social, political, or what not—that comes into your
mind. Or you may make a list of such topics, writing each on a separate
piece of paper; may jumble the slips in a hat; and may thus have always at
your elbow a collection of satisfactory themes from which you may take one
at random. Or you may invest in language of your own selection the
substance of an address or sermon you have heard, or give the burden of
some important conversation in which you have participated, or explain the
tenor of an article you have read. You should of course try to interest
your hearers, and above all, you should impart to what you say complete
clarity.</p>
<p>In analyzing you should select as your topic a process fairly obscure, the
implications of a certain statement or argument, the results to be
expected from some action or policy that has been advocated, or the exact
matter at issue between two disputants. Any topic for discussion,
explanation, or argument may be treated analytically. Your analysis in its
final form should be so carefully considered that its soundness cannot be
impeached.</p>
<p>In arguing you may take any subject under the sun, from baseball to
Bolshevism, for all of them are debated with vehemence. Any topic for
discussion or explanation becomes, when approached from some particular
angle, material for argument. Thus the initial topic in the exercise that
follows is "The aeroplane's future as a carrier of mail." You may convert
it into a question for debate by making it read: "The aeroplane is
destined to supplant the railroad as a carrier of mail," or "The aeroplane
is destined to be used increasingly as a carrier of transcontinental
mail." In arguing you may propose for yourself either of two objectives:
(1) to silence your opponent, (2) to refute, persuade, and win him over
fairly. The achievement of the first end calls for bluster and perhaps a
grim, barbaric strength; you must do as Johnson did according to
Goldsmith's famous dictum—if your pistol misses fire, you must knock your
adversary down with the butt end of it. This procedure, though inartistic
to be sure, is in some contingencies the only kind that will serve. But
you should cultivate procedure of a type more urbane. Let your very
reasonableness be the most potent weapon you wield. To this end you should
form the habit of looking for good points on both sides of a question. As
a still further precaution against contentiousness you should uphold the
two sides successively.</p>
<p>In narrating you should, as a rule, stick to simple occurrences, though
you may occasionally vary your work by summarizing the plot of a novel or
giving the gist and drift of big historical events. You should confine
yourself, in large part, to incidents in which you have been personally
involved, or which you yourself have witnessed, as mishaps, unexpected
encounters, bickerings, even rescues or riots. You should omit
non-essentials and make the happening itself live for your hearer; if you
can so interest him in it that he will not notice your manner of telling
it, your success is but the greater.</p>
<p>Finally, in describing you should deal for the most part with beings,
objects, and appearances familiar to you. Description is usually hard to
make vivid. This is because the objects and scenes are likely to be
immobile and (at least when told about) to lack distinctiveness. Try,
therefore, to lay hold of the peculiar quality of the thing described, and
use words suggestive of color and motion. Moreover be brief. Long
descriptions are sure to be wearisome.</p>

<p>For convenience, we have heretofore assumed that ideas and emotions,
together with such expression of them as shall be in itself adequate and
faithful, comprise the sole elements that have to be reckoned with in the
use of words in combination. But as you go out into life you will find
that these things, however complete they may seem, are not in practice
sufficient. Another factor—the human—must have its place in our
equation. You do not speak or write in a vacuum. Your object, your
ultimate object at least, in building up your vocabulary is to address men
and women; and among men and women the varieties of training, of stations,
of outlooks, of sentiments, of prejudices, of caprices are infinite. To
gain an unbiased hearing you must take persistent cognizance of flesh and
blood.</p>
<p>In adapting discourse to audience you must have a supple and attentive
mind and an impressionable and swiftly responsive temperament as well as a
wide, accurate, and flexible vocabulary. Unless you are a fool, a zealot,
or an incorrigible adventurer, you will not broach a subject at all to
which your hearers feel absolute indifference or hostility. Normally you
should pick a subject capable of interesting them. In presenting it you
should pay heed to both your matter and your manner. You should emphasize
for your listeners those aspects of the subject which they will most
respond to or most need to hear, whether or not the phases be such as you
would emphasize with other auditors. You should also speak in the fashion
you deem most effective with them, whether or not it be one to which your
own natural instincts prompt you.</p>
<p>Let us say you are discussing conditions in Europe. You must speak in one
way to the man who has traveled and in an entirely different way to the
man who has never gone abroad—in one way to the well-read man, in an
entirely different way to the ignoramus. Let us say you are discussing
urban life, urban problems. You must speak in one way to the man who lives
in the city, in another to the man who lives in the country. Let us say
you are discussing the labor problem. You must speak in one way to
employers, in another to employees, possibly in a third to men thrown out
of jobs, possibly in a fourth to the general public. Let us say you are
discussing education, or literature, or social tendencies, or mechanical
principles or processes, or some great enterprise or movement. You must
speak in one way to cultivated hearers and in another to men in the
street, and if you are a specialist addressing specialists, you will cut
the garment of your discourse to their particular measure.</p>
<p>The same principle holds regardless of whether you expound, analyze,
argue, recount, or describe. You must always keep a finger on the mental
or emotional pulse of those whom you address. But your problem varies
slightly with the form of discourse you adopt. In explanation, analysis,
and argument the chief barriers you encounter are likely to be those of
the mind; you must make due allowance for the intellectual limitations of
your auditors, though many who have capacity enough may for some cause or
other be unreceptive to ideas. In description you must reckon with the
imaginative faculty, with the possibility that your hearers cannot
visualize what you tell them—and you must make your words brief. In
narration you must vivify emotional torpor; but lest in your efforts to
inveigle boredom you yourself should induce it, you must have a wary eye
for signals of distress.</p>

<p><strong>    INDIVIDUAL WORDS: AS VERBAL CELIBATES</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Thus far we have studied words as grouped together into phrases,
sentences, paragraphs, whole compositions. We must now enter upon a new
phase of our efforts to extend our vocabulary. We must study words as
individual entities.</p>
<p>You may think the order of our study should be reversed. No great harm
would result if it were. The learning of individual words and the
combining of them into sentences are parallel rather than successive
processes. In our babyhood we do not accumulate a large stock of terms
before we frame phrases and clauses. And our attainment of the power of
continuous iteration does not check our inroads among individual words. We
do the two things simultaneously, each contributing to our success with
the other. There are plenty of analogies for this procedure. A good
baseball player, for instance, tirelessly studies both the minutiae of his
technique (as how to hold a bat, how to stand at the plate) and the big
combinations and possibilities of the game. A good musician keeps
unremitting command over every possible touch of each key and at the same
time seeks sweeping mastery over vast and complex harmonies. So we, if we
would have the obedience of our vocabularies, dare not lag into desultory
attention to either words when disjoined or words as potentially combined
into the larger units of thought and feeling.</p>
<p>We might therefore consider either the individuals first or the groups
first. But the majority of speakers and writers pay more heed to rough
general substance than to separate instruments and items. Hence we have
thought best to begin where most work is going on already—with words in
combination.</p>
<p>As you turn from the groups to the individuals, you must understand that
your labors will be onerous and detailed. You must not assume that by
nature all words are much alike, any more than you assume that all men are
much alike. Of course the similarities are many and striking, and the
fundamental fact is that a word is a word as a man is a man. But you will
be no adept in handling either the one or the other until your knowledge
goes much farther than this. Let us glance first at the human variations.
Each man has his own business, and conducts it in his own way—a way never
absolutely matched with that of any other mortal being. All this you may
see. But besides the man's visible employment, he may be connected in
devious fashions with a score of enterprises the public knows nothing
about. Furthermore he leads a private life (again not precisely
corresponding to that of any other), has his hobbies and aversions, is
stamped with a character, a temperament of his own. In short, though in
thousands of respects he is like his fellows, he has after all no human
counterpart; he is a distinct, individual self. To know him, to use him,
to count upon his service in whatsoever contingency it might bestead you,
you must deem him something more than a member of the great human family.
You must cultivate him personally, cultivate him without weariness or
stint, and undergo inconvenience in so doing.</p>
<p>Even so with a word. Commonplace enough it may seem. But it has its
peculiar characteristics, its activities undisclosed except to the
curious, its subtle inclinations, its repugnances, its latent
potentialities. There is no precise duplicate for it in all the wide
domain of language. To know it intimately and thoroughly, to be on
entirely free terms with it, to depend upon it just so far as dependence
is safe, to have a sure understanding of what it can do and what it
cannot, you must arduously cultivate it. Words, like people, yield
themselves to the worthy. They hunger for friendship—and lack the last
barrier of reserve which hedges all human communion. Thus, linguistically
speaking, you must search out the individuals. You must step aside from
your way for the sake of a new acquaintance; in conversations, in sermons,
in addresses, in letters, in journalistic columns, in standard literature
you must grasp the stranger by the hand and look him straight in the eye.
Nor must you treat cavalierly the words you know already. You must study
them afresh; you must learn them over and learn them better; you must come
to understand them, not only for what they are, but for what they will do.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;What Words to Learn First&gt;</p>
<p>What, then, is your first task? Somebody has laid down the injunction—
and, as always when anything is enjoined, others have given it currency—
that each day you should learn two new words. So be it,—but which two?
The first two in the dictionary, or hitherto left untouched in your
systematic conquest of the dictionary? The first two you hear spoken? The
first two that stare at you from casual, everyday print? The first two you
can ferret from some technical jargon, some special department of human
interest or endeavor? In any of these ways you may obey the behest of
these mentors. But are not such ways arbitrary, haphazard? And suppose,
after doing your daily stint, you should encounter a word it behooves you
to know. What then? Are you to sulk, to withhold yourself from further
exertion on the plea of a vocabulary-builder's eight-hour day?</p>
<p>To adopt any of the methods designated would be like resolving to invest
in city lots and then buying properties as you encountered them, with no
regard for expenditure, for value in general, or for special
serviceability to you. Surely such procedure would be unbusinesslike. If
you pay out good money, you meditate well whether that which you receive
for it shall compensate you. Likewise if you devote time and effort to
gaining ownership of words, you should exercise foresight in determining
whether they will yield you commensurate returns.</p>
<p>What, then, is the principle upon which, at the outset, you should
proceed? What better than to insure the possession of the words regarding
which you know this already, that you need them and should make them
yours?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;The Analysis of Your Own Vocabulary&gt;</p>
<p>The natural way, and the best, to begin is with an analysis of your own
vocabulary. You are of course aware that of the enormous number of words
contained in the dictionary relatively few are at your beck and bidding.
But probably you have made no attempt to ascertain the nature and extent
of your actual linguistic resources. You should make an inventory of the
stock on hand before sending in your order for additional goods.</p>
<p>You will speedily discover that your vocabulary embraces several distinct
classes of words. Of these the first consists of those words which you
have at your tongue's end—which you can summon without effort and use in
your daily speech.  They are old verbal friends. Numbered with them, to be
sure, there may be a few with senses and connotations you are ignorant of—
friends of yours, let us say, with a reservation. Even these you may woo
with a little care into uncurbed fraternal abandon. With the exception of
these few, you know the words of the first class so well that without
thinking about it at all you may rely upon their giving you, the moment
you need them, their untempered, uttermost service. You need be at no
further pains about them. They are yours already.</p>
<p>A second class of words is made up of those you speak on occasions either
special or formal—occasions when you are trying, perhaps not to show off,
but at least to put your best linguistic foot foremost. Some of them have
a meaning you are not quite sure of; some of them seem too ostentatious
for workaday purposes; some of them you might have been using but somehow
have not. Words of this class are not your bosom friends. They are your
speaking acquaintance, or perhaps a little better than that. You must
convert them into friends, into prompt and staunch supporters in time of
need. That is to say, you must put them into class one. In bringing about
this change of footing, you yourself must make the advances. You must say,
Go to, I will bear them in mind as I would a person I wished to cultivate.
When occasion rises, you must introduce them into your talk. You will feel
a bit shy about it, for introductions are difficult to accomplish
gracefully; you will steal a furtive glance at your hearer perchance, and
another at the word itself, as you would when first labeling a man "my
friend Mr. Blank." But the embarrassment is momentary, and there is no
other way. Assume a friendship if you have it not, and presently the
friendship will be real. You must be steadfast in intention; for the words
that have held aloof from you are many, and to unloose all at once on a
single victim would well-nigh brand you criminal. But you will make sure
headway, and will be conscious besides that no other class of words in the
language will so well repay the mastering. For these are words you
<emphasis>do</emphasis> use, and need to use more, and more freely—words your own
experience stamps as valuable, if not indeed vital, to you.</p>
<p>The third class of words is made up of those you do not speak at all, but
sometimes write. They are acquaintance one degree farther removed than
those of the second class. Your task is to bring them into class two and
thence into class one—that is, to introduce them into your more formal
speech, and from this gradually into your everyday speech.</p>
<p>The fourth class of words is made up of those you recognize when you hear
or read them, but yourself never employ. They are acquaintance of a very
distant kind. You nod to them, let us say, and they to you; but there the
intercourse ends. Obviously, they are not to be brought without
considerable effort into a position of tried and trusted friendship. And
shall we be absolutely honest?—some of them may not justify such
assiduous care as their complete subjugation would call for. But even
these you should make your feudal retainers. You should constrain them to
membership in class three, and at your discretion in class two.</p>
<p>Apart from the words in class four, you will not to this point have made
actual additions to your vocabulary. But you will have made your
vocabulary infinitely more serviceable. You will be like a man with a host
of friends where before, when his necessities were sorest, he found (along
with some friends) many distant and timid acquaintance.</p>
<p>Outside the bounds of your present vocabulary altogether are the words you
encounter but do not recognize, except (it may be) dimly and uncertainly.
Some counselors would have you look up all such words in a dictionary. But
the task would be irksome. Moreover those who prescribe it are loath to
perform it themselves. Your own candid judgment in the matter is the
safest guide. If the word is incidental rather than vital to the meaning
of the passage that contains it, and if it gives promise of but rarely
crossing your vision again, you should deign it no more than a civil
glance. Plenty of ways will be left you to expend time wisely in the
service of your vocabulary.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Analysis</p>
<p>1. Make a list of the words in class two of your own vocabulary, and
similar lists for classes three and four. (To make a list for class one
would be but a waste of time.) Procure if you can for this purpose a
loose-leaf notebook, and in the several lists reserve a full page for each
letter of the alphabet as used initially. Do not scamp the lists, though
their proper preparation consume many days, many weeks. Try to make them
really exhaustive. Their value will be in proportion to their accuracy and
fulness.</p>
<p>2. Con the words in each list carefully and repeatedly. Your task is to
transfer these words into a more intimate list—those in class four into
class three, those in three into two, those in two into one. You are then
to promote again the words in the lower classes, except that (if your
judgment so dictates) you may leave the new class three wholly or
partially intact. To carry out this exercise properly you must keep these
words in mind, make them part and parcel of your daily life. (For a
special device for bringing them under subjection, see the next exercise.)</p>
<p>3. To write a word down helps you to remember it. That is why the normal
way to transfer a word from class four into class two is to put it
temporarily into the intermediary class, three; you first <emphasis>see</emphasis> or
<emphasis>hear</emphasis> the word, next <emphasis>write</emphasis> it, afterwards <emphasis>speak</emphasis> it.
The mere writing down of your lists has probably done much to bring the
words written into the circuit of your memory, where you can more readily
lay hold of them. Also it has fortified your confidence in using them; for
to write a word out, letter by letter, makes you surer that you have its
right form. With many of your words you will likely have no more trouble;
they will be at hand, anxious for employment, and you may use them
according to your need. But some of your words will still stubbornly
withhold themselves from memory. Weed these out from your lists, make a
special list of them, copy it frequently, construct short sentences into
which the troublesome words fit. By dint of writing the words so often you
will soon make them more tractable.</p>
<p>4. Make a fifth list of words—those you hear or see printed, do not
understand the meaning of, but yet feel you should know. Obtain and
confirm a grasp of them by the successive processes used with words in the
preceding lists.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;The Definition of Words&gt;</p>
<p>Another means of buttressing your command of your present vocabulary is to
define words you use or are familiar with.</p>
<p>Do not bewilder yourself with words (like <emphasis>and, the</emphasis>) which call for
ingenuity in handling somewhat technical terms, or with words (like
<emphasis>thing, affair, condition</emphasis>) which loosely cover a multitude of
meanings. (You may, however, concentrate your efforts upon some one
meaning of words in the latter group.) Select words with a fairly definite
signification, and express this as precisely as you can. You may
afterwards consult a dictionary for means of checking up on what you have
done. But in consulting it think only of idea, not of form. You are not
training yourself in dictionary definitions, but in the sharpness and
clarity of your understanding of meanings.</p>
<p>About the only rule to be laid down regarding the definition of verbs,
adjectives, and adverbs is that you must not define a word in terms of
itself. Thus if you define <emphasis>grudgingly</emphasis> as "in a grudging manner,"
you do not dissipate your hearer's uncertainty as to what the word means.
If you define it as "unwillingly" or "in a manner that shows reluctance to
yield possession," you give your hearer a clear-cut idea in no wise
dependent upon his ability to understand the word that puzzled him in the
first place.</p>
<p>Normally, in defining a noun you should assign the thing named to a
general class, and to its special limits within that class; in other
words, you should designate its genus and species. You must take care to
differentiate the species from all others comprised within the genus.
You will, in most instances, first indicate the genus and then the
species, but at your convenience you may indicate the species first. Thus
if you affirm, "A cigar is smoking-tobacco in the form of a roll of
tobacco-leaves," you name the genus first and later the characteristics of
the species. You have given a satisfactory definition. If on the other
hand you affirm, "A cigar is a roll of tobacco-leaves meant for smoking,"
you first designate the species and then merely imply the genus. Again you
have given a satisfactory definition; for you have permitted no doubt that
the genus is smoking-tobacco, and have prescribed such limits for the
species as exclude tobacco intended for a pipe or a cigarette.</p>
<p>In defining nouns by the genus-and-species method, restrict the genus to
the narrowest possible bounds. You will thus save the need for exclusions
later. Had you in your first definition of a cigar begun by saying that it
is tobacco, rather than smoking-tobacco, you would have violated this
principle; and you would have had to amplify the rest of your definition
in order to exclude chewing-tobacco, snuff, and the like.</p>
<p>EXERCISE - Definition</p>
<p>1. Define words of your own choosing in accordance with the principles
laid down in the preceding section of the text.</p>
<p>2. Define the following adjectives, adverbs, and verbs:</p>
<p>Miserable      Rebuke       Wise</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Haughtily      Surly        Causelessly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>3. So define the following nouns as to prevent any possible confusion with
the nouns following them in parentheses:</p>
<p>Wages (salary)          Ride (drive)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Planet (star)           Truck (automobile)</p>

and mean different things to different people, define them according to
their meaning to you:</p>

<p>&lt;How to Look Up a Word in the Dictionary&gt;</p>
<p>So much for the words which are already yours, or which you can make yours
through your own unaided efforts. For convenience we have grouped with
them some words of a nature more baffling—words of which you know perhaps
but a single aspect rather than the totality, or upon which you can obtain
but a feeble and precarious grip. These slightly known words belong more
to the class now to be considered than to that just disposed of. For we
have now to deal with words over which you can establish no genuine
rulership unless you have outside help.</p>
<p>You must own a dictionary, have it by you, consult it carefully and often.
Do not select one for purchasing upon the basis of either mere bigness or
cheapness. If you do, you may make yourself the owner of an out-of-date
reprint from stereotyped plates. What to choose depends partly upon
personal preference, partly upon whether your need is for
comprehensiveness or compression.</p>
<p>If you are a scholar, <emphasis>Murray's</emphasis> many-volumed <emphasis>New English
Dictionary</emphasis> may be the publication for you; but if you are an ordinary
person, you will probably content yourself with something less expensive
and exhaustive. You will find the <emphasis>Century Dictionary and
Cyclopedia</emphasis>, in twelve volumes, or <emphasis>Webster's New International
Dictionary</emphasis> an admirable compilation. The <emphasis>New Standard
Dictionary</emphasis> will also prove useful. All in all, if you can afford it,
you should provide yourself with one or the other of these three large and
authoritative, but not too inclusive, works. Of the smaller lexicons
<emphasis>Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Webster's Secondary School
Dictionary</emphasis>, the <emphasis>Practical Standard Dictionary</emphasis>, and the <emphasis>Desk
Standard Dictionary</emphasis> answer most purposes well.</p>
<p>A dictionary is not for show. You must learn to use it. What ordinarily
passes for use is in fact abuse. Wherein? Let us say that you turn to your
lexicon for the meaning of a word. Of the various definitions given, you
disregard all save the one which enables the word to make sense in its
present context, or which fits your preconception of what the word should
stand for. Having engaged in this solemn mummery, you mentally record the
fact that you have been squandering your time, and enter into a compact
with yourself that no more will you so do. At best you have tided over a
transitory need, or have verified a surmise. You have not truly
<emphasis>learned</emphasis> the word, brought it into a vassal's relationship with you,
so fixed it in memory that henceforth, night or day, you can take it up
like a familiar tool.</p>
<p>This procedure is blundering, farcical, futile, incorrect. To suppose you
have learned a word by so cursory a glance at its resources is like
supposing you have learned a man through having had him render you some
temporary and trivial service, as lending you a match or telling you the
time of day. To acquaint yourself thoroughly with a word—or a man—
involves effort, application. You must go about the work seriously,
intelligently.</p>
<p>One secret of consulting a dictionary properly lies in finding the
primary, the original meaning of the word. You must go to the source. If
the word is of recent formation, and is native rather than naturalized
English, you have only to look through the definitions given. Such a word
will not cause you much trouble. But if the word is derived from primitive
English or from a foreign language, you must seek its origin, not in one
of the numbered subheads of the definition, but in an etymological record
you will perceive within brackets or parentheses. Here you will find the
Anglo-Saxon (Old English), Latin, Greek, French, German, Italian,
Scandinavian, or other word from which sprang the word you are studying,
and along with this authentic original you may find cognate words in other
languages. These you may examine if you care to observe their resemblance
to your word, but the examination is not necessary. It could teach you
only the earlier or other <emphasis>forms</emphasis> of your word, whereas what you are
after is the original <emphasis>meaning</emphasis>. This too is set down within the
brackets; if your search is in earnest, you cannot possible miss it. And
having discovered this original meaning, you must get it in mind; it is
one of the really significant things about the word. Your next step is to
find the present import of the word. Look, therefore, through the modern
definitions. Of these there may be too many, with too delicate shadings in
thought between them, for you to keep all clearly in mind. In fact you
need not try. Consider them of course, but out of them seek mainly the
drift, the central meaning. After a little practice you will be able to
disengage it from the others.</p>
<p>You now know the original sense of the word and its central signification
today. The two may be identical; they may be widely different; but through
reflection or study of the entire definition you will establish some sort
of connection between them. When you have done this, you have mastered the
word. From the two meanings you can surmise the others, wherever and
whenever encountered; for the others are but outgrowths and applications
of them.</p>
<p>One warning will not be amiss. You must not suppose that the terms used in
defining a word are its absolute synonyms, or may be substituted for it
indiscriminately. You must develop a feeling for <emphasis>the limits</emphasis> of the
word, so that you may perceive where its likeness to the other terms
leaves off and its unlikeness begins. Thus if one of the terms employed in
defining <emphasis>command</emphasis> is <emphasis>control</emphasis>, you must not assume that the
two words are interchangeable; you must not say, for instance, that the
captain controlled his men to present arms.</p>
<p>Such, abstractly stated, is the way to look up a word in the dictionary.
Let us now take a concrete illustration. Starting with the word
<emphasis>tension</emphasis>, let us ascertain what we can about it in the <emphasis>Century
Dictionary and Cyclopedia</emphasis>. Our first quest is the original meaning.
For this we consult the bracketed matter. There we meet the French,
Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian kinsmen of the word, and learn that they
are traceable to a common ancestor, the Latin <emphasis>tensio(n)</emphasis>, which
comes from the Latin verb <emphasis>tendere</emphasis>. The meaning of <emphasis>tensio(n)</emphasis>
is given as "stretching," that of <emphasis>tendere</emphasis> as "stretch," "extend."
Thus we know of the original word that in form it closely resembles the
modern word, and that in meaning it involves the idea of stretching.</p>
<p>What is the central meaning of the word today? To acquaint ourselves with
this we must run through the definitions listed. Here (in condensed form)
they are. (1) The act of stretching. (2) In <emphasis>mechanics</emphasis>, stress or
the force by which something is pulled. (3) In <emphasis>physics</emphasis>, a
constrained condition of the particles of bodies. (4) In <emphasis>statical
electricity</emphasis>, surface-density. (5) Mental strain, stress, or
application. (6) A strained state of any kind, as political or social. (7)
An attachment to a sewing-machine for regulating the strain of the thread.
Now of these definitions (2), (3), (4), and (7) are too highly specialized
to conduct us, of themselves, into the highway of the word's meaning. They
bear out, however, the evidence of (1), (5), and (6), which have as their
core the idea of stretching, or of the strain which stretching produces.</p>
<p>We must now lay the original meaning alongside the central meaning today,
in order to draw our conclusions. We perceive that the two meanings
correspond. Yet by prying into them we make out one marked difference
between them. The original meaning is literal, the modern largely
figurative. To be sure, the figure has been so long used that it is now
scarcely felt as a figure; its force and definiteness have departed.
Consequently we may speak of being on a tension without having in mind at
all a comparison of our nervous system with a stretched garment, or with
an outreaching arm, or with a tightly strung musical instrument, or with a
taut rope.</p>
<p>What, then, is the net result of our investigation? Simply this, that
<emphasis>tension</emphasis> means stretching, and that the stretching may be conceived
either literally or figuratively. With these two facts in mind, we need
not (unless we are experts in mechanics, physics, statical electricity, or
the sewing-machine) go to the trouble of committing the special senses of
<emphasis>tension</emphasis>; for should occasion bid, we can—from our position at the
heart of the word—easily grasp their rough purport. And from other
persons than specialists no more would be required.</p>

<p>&lt;Prying Into a Word's Past&gt;</p>
<p>To thread with minute fidelity the mazes of a word's former history is the
task of the linguistic scholar; our province is the practical and the
present-day. But words, like men, are largely what they are because of
what they have been; and to turn a gossip's eye upon their past is to
procure for ourselves, often, not only enlightenment but also
entertainment. This fact, though brought out in some part already,
deserves separate and fuller discussion.</p>
<p>In the first place, curiosity as to words' past experience enables us to
read with keener understanding the literature of preceding ages. Of course
we should not, even so, go farther back than about three centuries. To
read anything earlier than Shakespeare would require us to delve too
deeply into linguistic bygones. And to read Shakespeare himself requires
effort—but rewards it. Let us see how an insight into words will help us
to interpret the Seven Ages of Man (Appendix 4).</p>
<p>In line 2 of this passage appears the word <emphasis>merely</emphasis>. In Shakespeare's
time it frequently meant "altogether" or "that and nothing else." As here
used, it may be taken to mean this, or to have its modern meaning, or to
stand in meaning midway between the two and to be suggestive of both;
there is no way of determining precisely. In line 12 the word <emphasis>pard</emphasis>
means leopard. In line 18 <emphasis>saws</emphasis> means "sayings" (compare the phrase
"an old saw"); <emphasis>modern</emphasis> means "moderate," "commonplace";
<emphasis>instances</emphasis> means what we mean by it today, "examples,"
"illustrations." (Line 18 as a whole gives us a vivid sense of the
justice's readiness to speak sapiently, after the manner of justices, and
to trot out his trite illustrations on the slightest provocation.) The
word <emphasis>pantaloon</emphasis> in line 20 is interesting. The patron saint of
Venice was St. Pantaleon (the term is from Greek, means "all-lion," and
possibly refers to the lion of St. Mark's Cathedral). <emphasis>Pantaloon</emphasis>
came therefore to signify (1) a Venetian, (2) a garment worn by Venetians
and consisting of breeches and stockings in one. The second sense is
preserved, substantially, in our term <emphasis>pantaloons</emphasis>. The first sense
led to the use of the word (in the mouths of the Venetians' enemies) for
"buffoon" and then (in early Italian comedy) for "a lean and foolish old
man." It is this stock figure of the stage that Shakespeare evokes. In
line 22 <emphasis>hose</emphasis> means the covering for a man's body from his waist to
his nether-stock. (Compare the present meaning: a covering for the feet
and the <emphasis>lower</emphasis> part of the legs.) In line 27 <emphasis>mere</emphasis> means
"absolute." In line 28 <emphasis>sans</emphasis> means "without."</p>
<p>Of the words we have examined, only <emphasis>sans</emphasis> is obsolete, though
<emphasis>pard</emphasis>, <emphasis>saws</emphasis>, and <emphasis>pantaloon</emphasis> are perhaps not entirely
familiar. That is, only one word in the passage, so far as its outward
form goes, is completely alien to our knowledge. But how different the
matter stands when we consider meanings! The words are words of today, but
the meanings are the meanings of Shakespeare. We should be baffled and
misled as to the dramatist's thought if we had made no inquiries into the
vehicle therefor.</p>
<p>In the second place, to look beyond the present into the more remote
signification of words will put us on our guard against the reappearance
of submerged or half-forgotten meanings. We have seen that the word
<emphasis>tension</emphasis> may be used without conscious connection with the idea of
stretching. But if we incautiously place the word in the wrong
environment, the idea will be resurrected to our undoing. We associate
<emphasis>ardor</emphasis> with strong and eager desire. For ordinary purposes this
conception of the word suffices. But <emphasis>ardor</emphasis> is one of the children
of fire; its primary sense is "burning" (compare <emphasis>arson</emphasis>). Therefore
to pronounce the three vocables "overflowing with ardor" is to mix figures
of speech absurdly. We should fall into a similar mistake if we said
"brilliant fluency," and into a mistake of another kind (that of tautology
or repetition of an idea) if we said "heart-felt cordiality," for
<emphasis>cordiality</emphasis> means "feelings of the heart." <emphasis>Appreciate</emphasis> means
"set a (due) value on." We may perhaps say "really appreciate," but
scrupulous writers and speakers do not say "appreciate very much." A
<emphasis>humor</emphasis> (compare humid) was once a "moisture"; then one of the four
moistures or liquids that entered into the human constitution and by the
proportions of their admixture determined human temperament; next a man's
outstanding temperamental quality (the thing itself rather than the cause
of it); then oddity which people may laugh at; then the spirit of laughter
and good nature in general. Normally we do not connect the idea of
moisture with the word. We may even speak of "a dry humor." But we should
not say "now and then a dry humor crops out," for then too many buried
meanings lie in the same grave for the very dead to rest peacefully
together.</p>
<p>Even apart from reading old literature and from having, when you use
words, no ghosts of their pristine selves rise up to damn you, you may
profit from a knowledge of how the meaning of a term has evolved. For
example, you will meet many tokens and reminders of the customs and
beliefs of our ancestors. Thus <emphasis>coxcomb</emphasis> carries you back to the days
when every court was amused by a "fool" whose head was decked with a
cock's comb; <emphasis>crestfallen</emphasis> takes you back to cockfighting; and
<emphasis>lunatic</emphasis> ("moonstruck"), <emphasis>disaster</emphasis> ("evil star"), and "thank
your lucky stars" plant you in the era of superstition when human fate was
governed by heavenly bodies.</p>
<p>Further, you will perceive the poetry of words. Thus to <emphasis>wheedle is</emphasis>
to wag the tail and to <emphasis>patter</emphasis> is to hurry through one's prayers
(paternoster). What a picture of the frailty of men even in their holiness
flashes on us from that word <emphasis>patter! Breakfast is</emphasis> the breaking of
the fast of the night. <emphasis>Routine</emphasis> (the most humdrum of words) is
travel along a way already broken. <emphasis>Goodby</emphasis> is an abridged form of
"God be with you." <emphasis>Dilapidated</emphasis> is fallen stone from stone.
<emphasis>Daisy</emphasis> is "the day's eye," <emphasis>nasturtium</emphasis> (from its spicy smell)
"the nose-twister," <emphasis>dandelion</emphasis> "the tooth of the lion." <emphasis>A
lord</emphasis> is a bread-guard.</p>
<p>You will perceive, moreover, that many a dignified word once involved the
same idea as some unassuming or even semi-disreputable word or expression
involves now. Thus there is little or no difference in figure between
understanding a thing and getting on to it; between averting something
(turning it aside) and sidetracking it; between excluding (shutting out)
and closing the door to; between degrading (putting down a step) and
taking down a notch; between accumulating (heaping up) and making one's
pile; between taking umbrage (the shadow) and being thrown in the shade;
between ejaculating and throwing out a remark; between being on a tension
and being highstrung; between being vapid and having lost steam; between
insinuating (winding in) and worming in; between investigating and
tracking; between instigating (goading on or into) and prodding up;
between being incensed (compare <emphasis>incendiary</emphasis>) and burning with
indignation; between recanting (unsinging) and singing another tune;
between ruminating (chewing) and smoking in one's pipe. Nor is there much
difference in figure between sarcasm (a tearing of the flesh) and taking
the hide off; between sinister (left-handed) and backhanded; between
preposterous (rear end foremost) and cart before the horse; between salary
(salt-money, an allowance for soldiers) and pin-money; between pedigree
(crane's foot, from the appearance of genealogical diagrams) and crowsfeet
(about the eyes); between either precocious (early cooked), apricot (early
cooked), crude (raw), or recrudescence (raw again) and half-baked. To
ponder is literally to weigh; to apprehend an idea is to take hold of it;
to deviate is to go out of one's way; to congregate is to flock together;
to assail or insult a man is to jump on him; to be precipitate is to go
head foremost; to be recalcitrant is to kick.</p>
<p>Again, you will perceive that many words once had more literal or more
definitely concrete meanings than they have now. To corrode is to gnaw
along with others, to differ is to carry apart, to refuse is to pour back.
Polite is polished, absurd is very deaf, egregious is taken from the
common herd, capricious is leaping about like a goat, cross (disagreeable)
is shaped like a cross, wrong is wrung (or twisted). Crisscross is
Christ's cross, attention is stretching toward, expression is pressed out,
dexterity is right-handedness, circumstances are things standing around,
an innuendo is nodding, a parlor is a room to talk in, a nostril is that
which pierces the nose (thrill means pierce), vinegar is sharp wine, a
stirrup is a rope to mount by, a pastor is a shepherd, a marshal is a
caretaker of horses, a constable is a stable attendant, a companion is a
sharer of one's bread.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>On the other hand, you will find that many words were once more general in
import than they have since become. <emphasis>Fond</emphasis> originally meant foolish,
then foolishly devoted, then (becoming more general again) devoted.
<emphasis>Nostrum</emphasis> meant our own, then a medicine not known by other
physicians, then a quack remedy. <emphasis>Shamefast</emphasis> meant confirmed in
modesty (shame); then through a confusion of <emphasis>fast</emphasis> with
<emphasis>faced</emphasis>, a betrayal through the countenance of self-consciousness or
guilt. <emphasis>Counterfeit</emphasis> meant a copy or a picture, then an unlawful
duplication, especially of a coin. <emphasis>Lust</emphasis> meant pleasure of any sort,
then inordinate sexual pleasure or desire. <emphasis>Virtue</emphasis> (to trace only a
few of its varied activities) meant manliness, then the quality or
attribute peculiar to true manhood (with the Romans this was valor), then
any admirable quality, then female chastity. <emphasis>Pen</emphasis> meant a feather,
then a quill to write with, then an instrument for writing used in the
same way as a quill. A <emphasis>groom</emphasis> meant a man, then a stableman (in
<emphasis>bridegroom</emphasis>, however, it preserves the old signification).
<emphasis>Heathen</emphasis> (heath-dweller), <emphasis>pagan</emphasis> (peasant), and <emphasis>demon</emphasis>
(a divinity) had in themselves no iniquitous savor until early Christians
formed their opinion of the people inaccessible to them and the spirits
incompatible with the unity of the Godhead. Words betokening future
happenings or involving judgment tend to take a special cast from the
fears and anxieties men feel when their fortune is affected or their
destiny controlled by external forces. Thus <emphasis>omen</emphasis> (a prophetic
utterance or sign) and <emphasis>portent</emphasis> (a stretching forward, a foreseeing,
a foretelling) might originally be either benign or baleful; but nowadays,
especially in the adjectival forms <emphasis>ominous</emphasis> and <emphasis>portentous</emphasis>,
they wear a menacing hue. Similarly <emphasis>criticism</emphasis>, <emphasis>censure</emphasis>, and
<emphasis>doom</emphasis>, all of them signifying at first mere judgment, have come—the
first in popular, the other two in universal, usage—to stand for adverse
judgment. The old sense of <emphasis>doom</emphasis> is perpetuated, however, in
<emphasis>Doomsday</emphasis>, which means the day on which we are all to be, not
necessarily sent to hell, but judged.</p>
<p>You will furthermore perceive that the exaggerated affirmations people are
always indulging in have led to the weakening of many a word. <emphasis>Fret</emphasis>
meant eat; formerly to say that a man was fretting was to use a vigorous
comparison—to have the man devoured with care. <emphasis>Mortify</emphasis> meant to
kill, then killed with embarrassment, then embarrassed. <emphasis>Qualm</emphasis> meant
death, but our qualms of conscience have degenerated into mere twinges.
Oaths are shorn of their might by overuse; <emphasis>confound</emphasis>, once a
tremendous malinvocation, may now fall from the lips of respectable young
ladies, and <emphasis>fie</emphasis>, in its time not a whit less dire, would be
scarcely out of place in even a cloister. Words designating immediacy come
to have no more strength than soup-meat seven times boiled.
<emphasis>Presently</emphasis> meant in the present, <emphasis>soon</emphasis> and <emphasis>by and by</emphasis>
meant forthwith. How they have lost their fundamental meaning will be
intelligible to you if you have in ordering something been told that it
would be delivered "right away," or in calling for a girl have been told
that she would be down "in a minute."</p>
<p>You will detect in words of another class a deterioration, not in force,
but in character; they have fallen into contemptuous or sinister usage.
Many words for skill or wisdom have been thus debased. <emphasis>Cunning</emphasis>
meant knowing, <emphasis>artful</emphasis> meant well acquainted with one's art,
<emphasis>crafty</emphasis> meant proficient in one's craft or calling, <emphasis>wizard</emphasis>
meant wise man. The present import of these words shows how men have
assumed that mental superiority must be yoked with moral dereliction or
diabolical aid. Words indicating the generality—indicating ordinary rank
or popular affiliations—have in many instances suffered the same decline.
<emphasis>Trivial</emphasis> meant three ways; it was what might be heard at the
crossroads or on any route you chanced to be traveling, and its value was
accordingly slight. <emphasis>Lewd</emphasis> meant belonging to the laity; it came to
mean ignorant, and then morally reprehensible. <emphasis>Common</emphasis> may be used
to signify ill-bred; <emphasis>vulgar</emphasis> may be and frequently is used to
signify indecent. <emphasis>Sabotage</emphasis>, from a French term meaning wooden shoe,
has come to be applied to the deliberate and systematic scamping of one's
work in order to injure one's employer. <emphasis>Idiot</emphasis> (common soldier)
crystallizes the exasperated ill opinion of officers for privates.
(<emphasis>Infantry</emphasis>—an organization of military infants—has on the contrary
sloughed its reproach and now enshrines the dignity of lowliness.)
Somewhat akin to words of this type is <emphasis>knave</emphasis>, which first meant
boy, then servant, then rogue. Terms for agricultural classes seldom
remain flattering. Besides such epithets as <emphasis>hayseed</emphasis> and
<emphasis>clodhopper</emphasis>, contemptuous in their very origin, <emphasis>villain</emphasis> (farm
servant), <emphasis>churl</emphasis> (farm laborer), and <emphasis>boor</emphasis> (peasant) have all
gathered unto themselves opprobrium; <emphasis>villain</emphasis> now involves a
scoundrelly spirit, <emphasis>churl</emphasis> a contumelious manner, <emphasis>boor</emphasis> a
bumptious ill-breeding; not one of these words is any longer confined in
its application to a particular social rank. Terms for womankind are soon
tainted. <emphasis>Wench</emphasis> meant at first nothing worse than girl or daughter,
<emphasis>quean</emphasis> than woman, <emphasis>hussy</emphasis> than housewife; even <emphasis>woman</emphasis> is
generally felt to be half-slighting. Terms affirming unacquaintance with
sin, or abstention from it, tend to be quickly reft of what praise they
are fraught with; none of us likes to be saluted as <emphasis>innocent</emphasis>,
<emphasis>guileless</emphasis>, or <emphasis>unsophisticated</emphasis>, and to be dubbed <emphasis>silly</emphasis> no
longer makes us feel blessed. Besides these and similar classes of words,
there are innumerable individual terms that have sadly lost caste. An
<emphasis>imp</emphasis> was erstwhile a scion; it then became a boy, and then a
mischievous spirit. A <emphasis>noise</emphasis> might once be music; it has ceased to
enjoy such possibilities. To live near a piano that is constantly banged
is to know how <emphasis>noise</emphasis> as a synonym for music was outlawed.</p>
<p>A backward glance over the history of words repays you in showing you the
words for what they are, and in having them live out their lives before
you. Do you know what an <emphasis>umpire</emphasis> is? He is a non (or num) peer, a
not equal man, an odd man—one therefore who can decide disputes. Do you
know what a <emphasis>nickname</emphasis> is? It is an eke (also) name, a title bestowed
upon one in addition to his proper designation. Do you know what a
<emphasis>fellow</emphasis>, etymologically speaking, is? He is a fee-layer, a partner,
a man who lays his fee (property) alongside yours. Do you know that
<emphasis>matinée</emphasis>, though awarded to the afternoon, meant primarily a morning
entertainment and has traveled so far from its original sense that we call
an actual before-noon performance a morning matinée? Do you know the past
of such words as <emphasis>bedlam</emphasis>, <emphasis>rival</emphasis>, <emphasis>parson</emphasis>,
<emphasis>sandwich</emphasis>, <emphasis>pocket handkerchief?</emphasis> <emphasis>Bedlam</emphasis>, a corruption
of <emphasis>Bethlehem</emphasis>, was a hospital for the insane in London; it came to
be a general term for great confusion or discord. <emphasis>Rivals</emphasis> were
formerly dwellers—that is, neighboring dwellers—on the bank of a stream;
disputes over water-rights gave the word its present meaning. A
<emphasis>person</emphasis> or <emphasis>parson</emphasis>, for the two were the same, was a mask
(literally, that through which the sound came); then an actor representing
a character in a play; then a representative of any sort; then the
representative of the church in a parish. A <emphasis>sandwich</emphasis> was a
stratification of bread and meat by the Earl of Sandwich, who was so loath
to leave the gaming table that he saved time by having food brought him in
this form. A <emphasis>kerchief</emphasis> was originally a cover for the head, and
indeed sundry amiable, old-fashioned grandmothers still use it for this
purpose. Afterward people carried it in their hands and called it a
<emphasis>handkerchief</emphasis>; and when they transferred it to the pocket, they
called it a <emphasis>pocket handkerchief</emphasis> or pocket hand head-cover. A
scrutiny of such words should convince you that the reading of the
dictionary, instead of being the dull occupation it is almost proverbially
reputed to be, may become an occupation truly fascinating. For clustered
about the words recorded in the dictionary are inexhaustible riches of
knowledge and of interest for those who have eyes to see.</p>

<p><strong>    INDIVIDUAL WORDS: AS MEMBERS OF VERBAL FAMILIES</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Our investigation into the nature, qualities, and fortunes of single words
must now merge into a study of their family connections. We do not go far
into this new phase of our researches before we perceive that the career
of a word may be very complicated. Most people, if you asked them, would
tell you that an individual word is a causeless entity—a thing that was
never begotten and lacks power to propagate. They would deny the
possibility that its course through the world could be other than
colorless, humdrum. Now words thus immaculately conceived and fatefully
impotent, words that shamble thus listlessly through life, there are. But
many words are born in an entirely normal way; have a grubby boyhood, a
vigorous youth, and a sober maturity; marry, beget sons and daughters,
become old, enfeebled, even senile; and suffer neglect, if not death. In
their advanced age they are exempted by the discerning from enterprises
that call for a lusty agility, but are drafted into service by those to
whom all levies are alike. Indeed in their very prime of manhood their
vicissitudes are such as to make them seem human. Some rise in the world
some sink; some start along the road of grandeur or obliquity, and then
backslide or reform. Some are social climbers, and mingle in company where
verbal dress coats are worn; some are social degenerates, and consort with
the ragamuffins and guttersnipes of language. Some marry at their own
social level, some above them, some beneath; some go down in childless
bachelorhood or leave an unkempt and illegitimate progeny. And if you
trace their own lineage, you will find for some that it is but decent and
middle-class, for some that it is mongrelized and miscegenetic, for some
that it is proud, ancient, yea perhaps patriarchal.</p>
<p>It is contrary to nature for a word, as for a man, to live the life of a
hermit. Through external compulsion or internal characteristics a word has
contacts with its fellows. And its most intimate, most spontaneous
associations are normally with its own kindred.</p>
<p>In our work hitherto we have had nothing to say of verbal consanguinity.
But we have not wholly ignored its existence, for the very good reason
that we could not. For example, in the latter portions of Chapter IV we
proceeded on the hypothesis that at least some words have ancestors. Also
in the analysis of the dictionary definition of <emphasis>tension</emphasis> we learned
that the word has, not only a Latin forebear, but French, Spanish,
Portuguese, and Italian kinsmen as well. One thing omitted from that
analysis would have revealed something further—namely, that the word has
its English kinfolks too. For the bracketed part of the dictionary
definition mentions two other English words, <emphasis>tend</emphasis> and <emphasis>tense</emphasis>,
which from their origin involve the same idea as that of <emphasis>tension</emphasis>—
the idea of stretching.</p>
<p>Now words may be akin in either of two ways. They may be related in blood.
Or they may be related by marriage. Let us consider these two kinds of
connection more fully.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Words Related in Blood&gt;</p>
<p>As an illustration of blood kinships enjoyed by a native English word take
the adjective <emphasis>good</emphasis>. We can easily call to mind other members of its
family: goodly, goodish, goody-goody, good-hearted, good-natured, good-
humored, good-tempered, goods, goodness, goodliness, gospel (good story),
goodby, goodwill, goodman, goodwife, good-for-nothing, good den (good
evening), the Good Book. The connection between these words is obvious.</p>
<p>Next consider a group of words that have been naturalized: scribe,
prescribe, ascribe, proscribe, transcribe, circumscribe, subscriber,
indescribable, scribble, script, scripture, postscript, conscript,
rescript, manuscript, nondescript, inscription, superscription,
description. It is clear that these words are each other's kith and kin in
blood, and that the strain or stock common to all is <emphasis>scribe</emphasis> or (as
sometimes modified) <emphasis>script</emphasis>. What does this strain signify? The idea
of writing. The <emphasis>scribes</emphasis> are a writing clan. Some of them, to be
sure, have strayed somewhat from the ancestral calling, for words are as
wilful—or as independent—as men. <emphasis>Ascribe</emphasis>, for example, does not
act like a member of the household of writers, whatever it may look like.
We should have to scrutinize it carefully or consult the record for it in
that verbal Who's Who, the dictionary, before we could understand how it
came by its scribal affiliations honestly. But once we begin to reflect or
to probe, we find we have not mistaken its identity. <emphasis>Ascribe</emphasis> is the
offspring of <emphasis>ad</emphasis> (to) and <emphasis>scribo</emphasis> (write), both Latin terms.
It originally meant writing to a person's name or after it (that is,
imputing to the person by means of written words) some quality or
happening of which he was regarded as the embodiment, source, or cause.
Nowadays we may saddle the matter on him through oral rather than written
speech. That is, <emphasis>ascribe</emphasis> has largely lost the writing traits. But
all the same it is manifestly of the writing blood.</p>
<p>The <emphasis>scribes</emphasis> are of undivided racial stock, Latin. Consider now the
<emphasis>manu</emphasis>, or <emphasis>man</emphasis>, words which sprang from the Latin
<emphasis>manus</emphasis>, meaning "hand." Here are some of them: manual, manoeuver,
mandate, manacle, manicure, manciple, emancipate, manage, manner,
manipulate, manufacture, manumission, manuscript, amanuensis. These too
are children of the same father; they are brothers and sisters to each
other. But what shall we say of legerdemain (light, or sleight, of hand),
maintain, coup de main, and the like? They bear a resemblance to the
<emphasis>man's</emphasis> and <emphasis>manu's</emphasis>, yet one that casual observers would not
notice. Is there kinship between the two sets of words? There is. But not
the full fraternal or sororal relation. The <emphasis>mains</emphasis> are children of
<emphasis>manus</emphasis> by a French marriage he contracted. With this French blood in
their veins, they are only half-brothers, half-sisters of the
<emphasis>manu's</emphasis> and the <emphasis>man's</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Your examination of the family trees of words will be practical, rather
than highly scholastic, in nature. You need not track every word in the
dictionary to the den of its remote parentage. Nor need you bother your
head with the name of the distant ancestor. But in the case of the large
number of words that have a numerous kindred you should learn to detect
the inherited strain. You will then know that the word is the brother or
cousin of certain other words of your acquaintance, and this knowledge
will apprise you of qualities in it with which you should reckon. To this
extent only must you make yourself a student of verbal genealogy.</p>

<p>&lt;Words Related by Marriage&gt;</p>
<p>That words marry and are given in marriage, is too generally overlooked.
Any student of a foreign language, German for instance, can recall the
thrill of discovery and the lift of reawakened hope that came to him when
first he suspected, aye perceived, the existence of verbal matrimony. For
weeks he had struggled with words that apparently were made up of
fortuitous collocations of letters. Then in some beatific moment these
huddles of letters took meaning; in instance after instance they
represented, not a word, but words—a linguistic household. Let them be
what they might—a harem, the domestic establishment of a Mormon, the
dwelling-place of verbal polygamists,—he could at last see order in their
relationships. To their morals he was indifferent, absorbed as he was in
his joy of understanding.</p>
<p>In English likewise are thousands of these verbal marriages. We may not be
aware of them; from our very familiarity with words we may overlook the
fact that in instances uncounted their oneness has been welded by a
linguistic minister or justice of the peace. But to read a single page or
harken for thirty seconds to oral discourse with our minds intent on such
states of wedlock is to convince ourselves that they abound. Consider this
list of everyday words: somebody, already, disease, vineyard, unskilled,
outlet, nevertheless, holiday, insane, resell, schoolboy, helpmate,
uphold, withstand, rainfall, deadlock, typewrite, football, motorman,
thoroughfare, snowflake, buttercup, landlord, overturn. Every term except
one yokes a verbal husband with his wife, and the one exception
(<emphasis>nevertheless</emphasis>) joins a uxorious man with two wives.</p>
<p>These marriages are of a simple kind. But the nuptial interlinkings
between families of words may be many and complicated. Thus there is a
family of <emphasis>graph</emphasis> (or write) words: graphic, lithograph, cerograph,
cinematograph, stylograph, telegraph, multigraph, seismograph, dictograph,
monograph, holograph, logograph, digraph, autograph, paragraph,
stenographer, photographer, biographer, lexicographer, bibliography,
typography, pyrography, orthography, chirography, calligraphy,
cosmography, geography. There is also a family of <emphasis>phone</emphasis> (or sound)
words: telephone, dictaphone, megaphone, audiphone, phonology, symphony,
antiphony, euphonious, cacophonous, phonetic spelling. It chances that
both families are of Greek extraction. Related to the <emphasis>graphs</emphasis>—their
cousins in fact—are the <emphasis>grams</emphasis>: telegram, radiogram, cryptogram,
anagram, monogram, diagram, logogram, program, epigram, kilogram,
ungrammatical. Now a representative of the <emphasis>graphs</emphasis> married into the
<emphasis>phone</emphasis> family, and we have graphophone. A representative of the
<emphasis>phones</emphasis> married into the <emphasis>graph</emphasis> family, and we have
phonograph. A representative of the <emphasis>grams</emphasis> married into the
<emphasis>phone</emphasis> family, and we have gramophone. A representative of the
<emphasis>phones</emphasis> married into the <emphasis>gram</emphasis> family, and we have phonogram.
Of such unions children may be born. For example, from the marriage of Mr.
Phone with Miss Graph were born phonography, phonographer, phonographist
(a rather frail child), phonographic, phonographical, and
phonographically.</p>
<p>Intermarriage between the <emphasis>phones</emphasis> and the <emphasis>graphs</emphasis> or
<emphasis>grams</emphasis> is a wedding of equals. Some families of words, however, are
of inferior social standing to other families, and may seek but not hope
to be sought in marriage. Compare the <emphasis>ex's</emphasis> with the <emphasis>ports</emphasis>.
An <emphasis>ex</emphasis>, as a preposition, belongs to a prolific family but not one
of established and unimpeachable dignity. Hence the <emphasis>ex's</emphasis>, though
they marry right and left, lead the other words to the altar and are never
led thither themselves. Witness exclude, excommunicate, excrescence,
excursion, exhale, exit, expel, expunge, expense, extirpate, extract; in
no instance does <emphasis>ex</emphasis> fellow its connubial mate—it invariably
precedes. The <emphasis>ports</emphasis>, on the other hand, are the peers of anybody.
Some of them choose to remain single: port, porch, portal, portly, porter,
portage. Here and there one marries into another family: portfolio,
portmanteau, portable, port arms. More often, however, they are wooed than
themselves do the pleading: comport, purport, report, disport, transport,
passport, deportment, importance, opportunity, importunate, inopportune,
insupportable. From our knowledge of the two families, therefore, we
should surmise that if any marriage is to take place between them; an
<emphasis>ex</emphasis> must be the suitor. The surmise would be sound. There is such a
term as <emphasis>export</emphasis>, but not as <emphasis>portex</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Now it is oftentimes possible to do business with a man without knowing
whether he is a man or a bridal couple. And so with a word. But the
knowledge of his domestic state and circumstances will not come amiss, and
it may prove invaluable. You may find that you can handle him to best
advantage through a sagacious use of the influence of his wife.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Marriage</p>
<p>1. For each word in the lists of EXERCISE - Dictionary and Activity 1 for
EXERCISE - Past, determine (a) whether it is single or married; (b) if it
is married, whether the wedding is one between equals.</p>
<p>2. Make a list of the married words in the first three paragraphs of the
selection from Burke (Appendix 2). For each of these words determine the
exact nature and extent of the dowry brought by each of the contracting
parties to the wedding.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Prying Into a Word's Relationships&gt;</p>
<p>Hitherto in our study of verbal relationships we have usually started with
the family. Having strayed (as by good luck) into an assembly of kinsmen,
we have observed the common strain and the general characteristics, and
have then "placed" the individual with reference to these. But we do not
normally meet words, any more than we meet men, in the domestic circle. We
meet them and greet them hastily as they hurry through the tasks of the
day, with no other associates about them than such as chance or momentary
need may dictate. If we are to see anything of their family life, it must
be through effort we ourselves put forth. We must be inquisitive about
their conjugal and blood relationships.</p>
<p>How, then, starting with the individual word, can you come into a
knowledge of it, not in its public capacity, but in what is even more
important, its personal connections? You must form the habit of asking two
questions about it: (1) Is it married? (2) Of what family or families was
it born? If you can get an understanding answer to these two questions, an
answer that will tell you what its relations stand for as well as what
their name is, your inquiries will be anything but bootless.</p>
<p>Let us illustrate your procedure concretely. Suppose you read or hear the
word <emphasis>conchology</emphasis>. It is a somewhat unusual word, but see what you
can do with it yourself before calling on the dictionary to help you.
Observe the word closely, and you will obtain the answer to your first
question. <emphasis>Conchology</emphasis> is no bachelor, no verbal old maid; it is a
married pair.</p>
<p>Your second and more difficult task awaits you; you must ascertain the
meaning of the family connections. With Mr. Conch you are on speaking
terms; you know him as one of the shells. But the utmost you can recall
about his wife is that she is one of a whole flock of <emphasis>ologies</emphasis>. What
significance does this relationship possess? You are uncertain. But do not
thumb the dictionary yet. Pass in mental review all the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis> you
can assemble. Wait also for the others that through the unconscious
operations of memory will tardily straggle in. Be on the lookout for
<emphasis>ologies</emphasis> as you read, as you listen. In time you will muster a
sizable company of them. And you will draw a conclusion as to the meaning
of the blood that flows through their veins. <emphasis>Ology</emphasis> implies speech
or study. <emphasis>Conchology</emphasis>, then, must be the study of conches.</p>
<p>Your investigations thus far have done more than teach you the meaning of
the word you began with. They have brought you some of the by-products of
the study of verbal kinships. For you no longer pass the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis> by
with face averted or bow timidly ventured. You have become so well
acquainted with them that even a new one, wherever encountered, would
flash upon you the face of a friend. But now your desires are whetted. You
wish to find out how much you <emphasis>can</emphasis> learn. You at last consult the
dictionary.</p>
<p>Here a huge obstacle confronts you. The <emphasis>ologies</emphasis>, like the
<emphasis>ports</emphasis> (above), are a haughty clan; they are the wooed, rather
than the wooing, members of most marital households that contain them. Now
the marriage licenses recorded in the dictionary are entered under the
name of the suitor, not of the person sought. Hence you labor under a
severe handicap as you take the census of the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis>. Let us
imagine the handicap the most severe possible. Let us suppose that no
<emphasis>ology</emphasis> had ever been the suitor. Even so, you would not be entirely
baffled. For you could look up in the dictionary the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis> you
your self had been able to recall. To what profit? First, you could verify
or correct your surmise as to what the <emphasis>ological</emphasis> blood betokens.
Secondly, you could perhaps obtain cross-references to yet other
<emphasis>ologies</emphasis> than those you remembered.</p>
<p>But you are not reduced to these extremities. The <emphasis>ologies</emphasis>, arrogant
as they are, sometimes are the applicants for matrimony, and the marriage
registry of the dictionary so indicates. To be sure, they do not, when
thus appearing at the beginning of words, take the form <emphasis>ology</emphasis>. They
take the form <emphasis>log</emphasis>. But you must be resourceful enough to keep after
your quarry in spite of the omission of a vowel or two. Also from some
lexicons you may obtain still further help. You may find <emphasis>ology, logy,
logo</emphasis>, or <emphasis>log</emphasis> listed as a combining form, its meaning given, and
examples of its use in compounds cited.</p>
<p>By your zeal and persistence you have now brought together a goodly array
of the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis>—all or most, let us say, of the following:
conchology, biology, morphology, phrenology, physiology, osteology,
histology, zoology, entomology, bacteriology, ornithology, pathology,
psychology, cosmology, eschatology, demonology, mythology, theology,
astrology, archeology, geology, meteorology, mineralogy, chronology,
genealogy, ethnology, anthropology, criminology, technology, doxology,
anthology, trilogy, philology, etymology, terminology, neologism,
phraseology, tautology, analogy, eulogy, apology, apologue, eclogue,
monologue, dialogue, prologue, epilogue, decalogue, catalogue, travelogue,
logogram, logograph, logo-type, logarithms, logic, illogical. (Moreover
you may have perceived in some of these words the kinship which exists in
all for the <emphasis>loquy</emphasis> group—see (1) Soliloquy below.) Of course you
will discard some items from this list as being too learned for your
purposes. But you will observe of the others that once you know the
meaning of <emphasis>ology</emphasis>, you are likely to know the whole word. Thus from
your study of <emphasis>conchology</emphasis> you have mastered, not an individual term,
but a tribe.</p>
<p>In <emphasis>conchology</emphasis> only one element, <emphasis>ology</emphasis>, was really dubious at
the outset. Let us take a word of which both elements give you pause.
Suppose your thought is arrested by the word <emphasis>eugenics</emphasis>. You perhaps
know the word as a whole, but not its components. For by looking at it and
thinking about it you decide that its state is married, that it comprises
the household of Mr. Eu and his wife, formerly Miss Gen. But you cannot
say offhand just what kind of person either Mr. Eu or the erstwhile Miss
Gen is likely to prove.</p>
<p>Have you met any of the <emphasis>Eu's</emphasis> elsewhere? You think vaguely that you
have, but cannot lay claim to any real acquaintance. To the dictionary you
accordingly betake yourself. There you find that Mr. Eu is of a family
quite respectable but not prone to marriage. <emphasis>Euphony, eupepsia,
euphemism, euthanasia</emphasis> are of his retiring kindred. The meaning of the
<emphasis>eu</emphasis> blood, so the dictionary informs you, is well. The <emphasis>gen</emphasis>
blood, as you see exemplified in gentle, general, genital, engender,
carries with it the idea of begetting, of producing, of birth, or (by
extension) of kinship. <emphasis>Eugenics</emphasis>, then, is an alliance of well and
begotten (or born).</p>
<p>Your immediate purpose is fulfilled; but you resolve, let us say, to make
the acquaintance of more of the <emphasis>gens</emphasis>, whose number you have
perceived to be legion. You are duly introduced to the following: genus,
generic, genre, gender, genitive, genius, general, Gentile, gentle,
gentry, gentleman, genteel, generous, genuine, genial, congeniality,
congener, genital, congenital, engender, generation, progeny, progenitor,
genesis, genetics, eugenics, pathogenesis, biogenesis, ethnogeny,
palingenesis, unregenerate, degenerate, monogeny, indigenous, exogenous,
homogeneous, heterogeneous, genealogy, ingenuous, ingenious, ingenue,
engine, engineer, hygiene, hydrogen, oxygen, endogen, primogeniture,
philoprogeniture, miscegenation. Some of these are professional rather
than social; you decide not to leave your card at their doors. Others have
assumed a significance somewhat un_gen_-like, though the relationship
may be traced if you are not averse to trouble, Thus <emphasis>engine</emphasis> in its
superficial aspects seems alien to the idea of born. But it is the child
of <emphasis>ingenious</emphasis> (innate, inborn); <emphasis>ingenious</emphasis> is the inborn power
to accomplish, and <emphasis>engine</emphasis> is the result of the application of that
power. Whether you care to bother with such subtleties or not, enough
<emphasis>gens</emphasis> are left to make the family one well worth your cultivation.</p>
<p>Thus by studying two words, <emphasis>conchology</emphasis> and <emphasis>eugenics</emphasis>, you
have for the first time placed yourself on an intimate footing with three
verbal families—the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis>, the <emphasis>eu's,</emphasis> and the <emphasis>gens</emphasis>.
Observe that though you studied the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis> apart from the
<emphasis>eu's</emphasis> and the <emphasis>gens</emphasis>, your knowledge—once you have acquired
it—cannot be kept pigeonholed, for the <emphasis>ologies</emphasis> have intermarried
with both the other families. Hence you on meeting <emphasis>eulogy</emphasis> can
exclaim: "How do you do, Mr. Eu? I am honored in making your acquaintance,
Mrs. Eu—I was about to call you by your maiden name; for I am a friend of
your sister, the Miss Ology who married Mr. Conch. And you too, Mr. Eu—I
cannot regard you as a stranger. I have looked in so often on the family
of your brother—the Euphony family, I mean. What a beautiful literary
household it is! Yet it has been neglected by the world-yea, even by the
people who write. Well, the loss is theirs who do the neglecting." And
<emphasis>genealogy</emphasis> you can greet with an equal parade of family lore: "Don't
trouble to tell me who you are. I am hob and nob with your folks on both
sides of the family, and my word for it, the relationship is written all
over you. Mr. Gen, I envy you the pride you must feel in the prominence
given nowadays to the <emphasis>eugenics</emphasis> household. And it must delight you,
Miss Ology-that-was, that connoisseurs are so keenly interested in
<emphasis>conchology</emphasis>. How are Grandfather Gen and Grandmother Ology? They
were keeping up remarkably the last time I saw them." Do you think words
will not respond to cordiality like this? They will work their flattered
heads off for you!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Relationships</p>
<p>1. For each of the following words (a) determine what families are
intermarried, (b) ascertain the exact contribution to the household by
each family represented, and (c) make as complete a list as possible of
cognate words.</p>
<p>Reject     Oppose     Convent     Defer     Omit     Produce     Expel</p>
<p>2. Test the extent of the intermarriages among these words by successively
attaching each of the prefixes to each of the main (or key) syllables.
(Thus re-ject, re-fer, re-pel, etc.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Two Admonitions&gt;</p>
<p>In tracing verbal kinships you must be prepared for slight variations in
the form of the same key-syllable. Consider these words: wise, wiseacre,
wisdom, wizard, witch, wit, unwitting, to wit, outwit, twit, witticism,
witness, evidence, providence, invidious, advice, vision, visit, vista,
visage, visualize, envisage, invisible, vis-à-vis, visor, revise,
supervise, improvise, proviso, provision, view, review, survey, vie, envy,
clairvoyance. Perhaps the last six should be disregarded as too
exceptional in form to be clearly recognized. And certainly some words, as
<emphasis>prudence</emphasis> from <emphasis>providentia</emphasis>, are so metamorphosed that they
should be excluded from practical lists of this kind. But even in the
words left to us there are fairly marked divergences in appearance. Why?
Because the key-syllable has descended to us, not through one language,
but through several. As good verbal detectives we should be able to
penetrate the consequent disguises; for <emphasis>wis, wiz, wit, vid, vic</emphasis>,
and <emphasis>vis</emphasis> all embody the idea of seeing or knowing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, you must take care not to be misled by a superficial
resemblance into thinking two unrelated key-syllables identical. Let us
consider two sets of words. The first, which is related to the <emphasis>tain</emphasis>
group (see &lt;Tain&gt; below), has a key-syllable that means holding:
tenant, tenement, tenure, tenet, tenor, tenable, tenacious, contents,
contentment, lieutenant, maintenance, sustenance, countenance,
appurtenance, detention, retentive, pertinacity, pertinent, continent,
abstinence, continuous, retinue. The second has a key-syllable that means
stretching: tend, tender, tendon, tendril, tendency, extend, subtend,
distend, pretend, contend, attendant, tense, tension, pretence, intense,
intensive, ostensible, tent, tenterhook, portent, attention, intention,
tenuous, attenuate, extenuate, antenna, tone, tonic, standard. The form of
the key-syllable for the first set of words is usually <emphasis>ten, tent</emphasis>,
or <emphasis>tin</emphasis>; that for the second <emphasis>tend, tens, tent</emphasis>, or <emphasis>ten</emphasis>.
You may therefore easily confuse the two groups until you have learned to
look past appearances into meanings. Thenceforth the holdings and the
stretchings will be distinct in your mind—will constitute two great
families, not one. Of course individual words may still puzzle you. You
will not perceive that <emphasis>tender</emphasis>, for example, belongs with the
stretchings until you go back to its primary idea of something stretched
thin, or that <emphasis>tone</emphasis> has membership in that family until you connect
it with the sound which a stretched chord emits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>FIRST GENERAL EXERCISE FOR THE CHAPTER</strong></p>
<p>Each of the key-syllables given below is followed by (1) a list of fairly
familiar words that embody it, (2) a list of less familiar words that
embody it, (3) several sentences containing blank spaces, into each of
which you are ultimately to fit the appropriate word from the first list.

meaning, (2) the influence of the key-syllable upon that meaning, (3) any
variation of the key-syllable from its ordinary form. (A few words have

<p><strong>FOURTH GENERAL EXERCISE</strong></p>
<p>With a few exceptions like the Hale-heal group above under Verbal
Families, most verbal families of straight English or of Germanic-
Scandinavian-English descent are easily recognizable as families. Witness
the <emphasis>Good</emphasis> family and the <emphasis>Stead</emphasis> family. The families in which
kinship may be overlooked are likely to be of Latin or Greek ancestry,
though perhaps with a subsequent infusion of blood from some other foreign
language, as French. Hitherto our approach to verbal families has been
through the descendants, or through that quality in their blood which
holds them together. But we shall also profit from knowing something of
the founders of these families—from having some acquaintance with them as
individuals. Below (in separate lists) the more prominent of Latin and of
Greek progenitors are named, their meaning is given, and two or three of
their living representatives (not always direct descendants) are
designated. Starred [*] words are those whose progeny has not been in good
part assembled in the preceding pages; for these words you should assemble
all the living representatives you can. (Inflectional forms are given only
where they are needed for tracing English derivatives.)</p>

<p><strong>    WORDS IN PAIRS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Our first task in this volume was the study of words in combination. Our
second was the study of individual words in two of their aspects—first,
as they are seen in isolation, next as they are seen in verbal families.
Now our third task confronts us. It is the study of words as they are
associated, not in actual blood kinship, but in meaning.</p>
<p>Such an association in meaning may involve only two words (pairs) or
larger groups. In this chapter we shall confine ourselves to the study of
pairs.</p>
<p>Of the relationship between pairs there are three types. In the first the
words are hostile to each other. In the second they may easily be confused
with each other. In the third they are parallel with each other. We shall
examine the three types successively.</p>
<p>But we must make an explanation first. Although we shall, in this and the
following chapters, have frequent occasion to give the meanings of
individual words, we shall give them without regard to dictionary methods.
We shall not attempt formal, water-tight, or exhaustive definitions; our
purpose is to convey, in the simplest and most human manner possible,
brief general explanations of what the words stand for.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Opposites&gt;</p>
<p>Pairs of the first type are made up of words by nature opposite to each
other, or else thought of as opposite because they are so often
contrasted. Here is a familiar, everyday list:</p>
<p>east, west       straight, crooked       myself, others
large, small     pretty, ugly            major, minor
laugh, cry       walk, ride              light, darkness
top, bottom      hard, soft              friend, enemy
sweet, sour      clean, dirty            temporal, spiritual
meat, drink      merry, sad              means, extremes
land, water      private, public         Jew, Gentile
man, woman       noisy, quiet            independent, dependent
old, new         general, particular     sublime, ridiculous
age, youth       wholesale, retail       give, receive
sick, well       savage, civilized       pride, humility
brain, brawn     wealth, poverty         constructive, destructive
soul, body       positive, negative</p>
<p>None of these words needs explaining. If you think of one of them, you
will think of its opposite; at least its opposite will be lurking in the
back of your mind. As proof of this fact you have only to glance at the
following list, from which the second member of each pair is omitted:</p>
<p>hot —         black —       boy —        in —
off —         over —        love —       wrong —
strong —      wet —         first —      day —
long —        fast —        good —       hope —
least —       asleep —      buy —        left —
alive —       winter —      war —        succeed —
creditor —    fat —         internal —   wise —
drunk —</p>
<p>Many words of a more difficult kind are thus pitted against each other,
and we learn them, not singly, but in pairs. At least we should. As good
verbal hunters we should be alert to the chance of killing two birds with
one stone.</p>
<p><emphasis>Allopath</emphasis> and <emphasis>homeopath</emphasis>, for example, are difficult
opposites. We know of the existence of the two classes of medical
practitioners; we know that they use different methods; but beyond this
our knowledge is likely to be hazy. Let us set out, then, to <emphasis>learn</emphasis>
the two words. The best way is to learn them together. <emphasis>Allopathy</emphasis>
means other suffering, <emphasis>homeopathy</emphasis> like suffering. An allopath uses
remedies which create within the patient a condition that squarely
conflicts with the further progress of the disease. A homeopath prescribes
medicines (in small doses) which produce within the patient the same
condition that the disease would produce; he "beats the disease to it," so
to speak—takes the job himself and leaves the disease nothing to do. The
allopath travels around a race-track in the opposite direction from the
disease, and thwarts it through a head-on collision. The homeopath travels
around the race-track in the same direction as the disease, and thwarts it
by pulling at the reins. If we consider the two words together and get
these ideas in mind, we shall have no further trouble with allopaths and
homeopaths—except, perhaps, when they have rendered their services and
presented their bills.</p>
<p><emphasis>Objective</emphasis> and <emphasis>subjective</emphasis> are also a troublesome pair. A
thing is objective if it is an actual object or being, if it exists in
itself rather than in our surmises. A thing is subjective if it is the
creature of a state of mind, if it has its existence in the thought or
imagination of some person or other. Thus if I meet a bear in the wilds,
that bear is objective; whatever may be the state of my thoughts, <emphasis>he is
there</emphasis>—and it would be to my advantage to reckon with this fact. But
if a child who is sent off to bed alone says there is a bear in the room,
the bear is subjective; it is not a living monster that will devour
anybody, but a creature called into the mind of the child through dread.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Opposites</p>
<p>Study the following words in pairs. Consult the dictionary for actual
meanings. Then test your knowledge by embodying each word of each pair in
a sentence, or in an illustration like those of the race-track and the
bear in the preceding paragraphs.</p>

export, import               domestic, foreign
fact, fiction                prose, poetry
verbal, oral                 literal, figurative
predecessor, successor       genuine, artificial
positive, negative           practical, theoretical
optimism, pessimism          finite, infinite
longitude, latitude          evolution, revolution
oriental, occidental         pathos, bathos
sacred, profane              military, civil
clergy, laity                capital, labor
ingress, egress              element, compound
horizontal, perpendicular    competition, coöperation
predestination, freewill     universal, particular
extrinsic, intrinsic         inflation, deflation
dorsal, ventral              acid, alkali
synonym, antonym             prologue, epilogue
nadir, zenith                amateur, connoisseur
anterior, posterior          stoic, epicure
ordinal, cardinal            centripetal, centrifugal
stalagmite, stalactite       orthodox, heterodox
homogeneous, heterogeneous   monogamy, polygamy
induction, deduction         egoism, altruism
Unitarian, Trinitarian       concentric, eccentric
herbivorous, carnivorous     deciduous, perennial

vertebrate, invertebrate     catalectic, acatalectic</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Words Often Confused&gt;</p>
<p>Pairs of the second type are made up of words which are often confused by
careless writers and speakers, and which should be accurately
discriminated.</p>
<p>Sometimes the words are actually akin to each other. <emphasis>Continuous-
continual</emphasis> and <emphasis>enormity-enormousness</emphasis> are examples. Sometimes
they merely look or sound much alike. <emphasis>Mean-demean</emphasis> and <emphasis>affect-
effect</emphasis> are examples. Sometimes the things they designate are more or
less related, so that the ideas behind the words rather than the words
themselves are responsible for the confusion. <emphasis>Contagious-infectious</emphasis>
and <emphasis>knowledge-wisdom</emphasis> are examples. Let us distinguish between the
two members of each of the pairs named.</p>
<p>A thing is <emphasis>continuous</emphasis> if it suffers no interruption whatever,
<emphasis>continual</emphasis> if it is broken at regular intervals but as regularly
renewed. Thus "a continuous stretch of forest"; "the continual drip of
water from the eaves."</p>
<p><emphasis>Enormity</emphasis> pertains to the moral and sometimes the social,
<emphasis>enormousness</emphasis> to the physical. Thus "the enormity of the crime,"
"the enormity of this social offense"; "the enormousness of prehistoric
animals."</p>
<p><emphasis>Demean</emphasis> is often used reproachfully because of its supposed relation
to <emphasis>mean</emphasis>. But it has nothing to do with <emphasis>mean</emphasis>. The word with
which to connect it is <emphasis>demeanor</emphasis> (conduct). Thus "We observed how he
demeaned himself" implies no adverse criticism of either the man or his
deportment. Both may be debased to be sure, but they may be exemplary.</p>
<p>To <emphasis>affect</emphasis> means to feign or to have an influence upon, to
<emphasis>effect</emphasis> to bring to pass. Thus "He affects a fondness for classical
music," "The little orphan's story affected those who heard it"; "We
effected a compromise." <emphasis>Affect</emphasis> is never properly used as a noun.
<emphasis>Effect</emphasis> as a noun means result, consequence, or practical operation.
Thus "The shot took instant effect"; "He put this idea into effect."</p>
<p>A disease is <emphasis>contagious</emphasis> when the only way to catch it is through
direct contact with a person already having it, or through contact with
articles such a person has used. A disease is <emphasis>infectious</emphasis> when it is
presumably caused, not by contact with a person, but through widespread
general conditions, as of climate or sanitation.</p>
<p>Our <emphasis>knowledge</emphasis> is our acquaintance with a fact, or the sum total of
our information. Our <emphasis>wisdom</emphasis> is our intellectual and spiritual
discernment, to which our knowledge is one of the contributors.
<emphasis>Knowledge</emphasis> comprises the materials; <emphasis>wisdom</emphasis> the ability to use
them to practical advantage and to worthy or noble purpose.
<emphasis>Knowledge</emphasis> is mental possession; <emphasis>wisdom</emphasis> is mental and moral
power.</p>

<p>2. Consult the dictionary for the distinction between the members of each
of the following pairs. Determine whether the words are correctly used in
the illustrative sentences. (Some are; some are not.)</p>
<p>&lt;Can, may.&gt; Can I stay at home this afternoon, papa? Because of the
floods, the train beyond doubt may not get through.</p>
<p>&lt;Character, reputation.&gt; His character among them was very good. A
man's reputation can never be taken from him.</p>
<p>&lt;Childish, childlike.&gt; Your conduct is peevish; it is childishly so.
Her innocence was childlike.</p>
<p>&lt;Cite, quote.&gt; He was always citing snatches of Tennyson. We might
quote Hamlet's soliloquy on suicide as an example of Shakespeare's ability
to go to the heart of deep questions.</p>
<p>&lt;Claim, assert.&gt; He claimed that Jefferson was our third President.
He asserted that bears sleep through the winter.</p>
<p>&lt;Clothing, costume.&gt; At the masquerade ball we each wore special
clothing. The mariner who had swum from the wreck to the desert shore had
not a shred of costume.</p>
<p>&lt;Comfort, ease.&gt; Comfort after labor. The ease of owning a home.</p>
<p>&lt;Commercial, mercantile.&gt; Petty commercial transactions. A mercantile
treaty.</p>
<p>&lt;Common, mutual.&gt; This pavilion was the common play-house for the
children of the neighborhood. Ward and Aker held this property as their
mutual possession.</p>
<p>&lt;Complement, compliment.&gt; This addition is the complement of our
quota. He paid his dancing partner a compliment.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>&lt;Complement, supplement.&gt; His downrightness is the complement of his
uprightness. As a supplement to his wages he received an occasional bonus.</p>
<p>&lt;Complete, finish.&gt; He put in the completing touches. He had finished
the task.</p>
<p>&lt;Composure, equanimity.&gt; His composure was not to be shaken. After
this inner tumult came equanimity.</p>
<p>&lt;Comprehensible, comprehensive.&gt; Numbers of such magnitude are
scarcely comprehensible. That men by the million should die for a cause is
a thing not really comprehensive.</p>
<p>&lt;Compulsion, obligation.&gt; Who does not feel within him a compulsion
to help the weak? It was through obligation, through having slave-drivers
stand over them, that these wretched folk built the pyramids.</p>
<p>&lt;Congratulate, felicitate.&gt; I congratulated my friend on his
appointment to the commission. I also felicitated the stranger on his
appointment.</p>
<p>&lt;Consecutive, successive.&gt; Three consecutive convictions proved the
ability of the prosecuting attorney. The quiet passing of successive
summer days.</p>
<p>&lt;Contemptible, contemptuous.&gt; Its size was insignificant, even
contemptible. He won the prize by a contemptuous trick.</p>
<p>&lt;Continuation, continuance.&gt; The investigator was surprised to find
the tradition of such long continuation. We waited impatiently for the
continuance of the story in the next issue.</p>
<p>&lt;Corporal, corporeal.&gt; I am more and more amazed at the perfection of
man's corporal frame. His corporeal vigor was unusual.</p>
<p>&lt;Correct, rectify.&gt; A man may correct many of his false judgments on
current affairs by studying history. The mistake is ours; it shall be
rectified.</p>
<p>&lt;Cozy, snug.&gt; The cozy fit of a garment. A snug place by the fire.</p>
<p>&lt;Crawl, creep.&gt; We crawled forward at dawn to surprise their
outposts. In his humility he fairly crept on the earth.</p>
<p>&lt;Credible, creditable.&gt; I do not doubt it; it is entirely credible.
The success of the antidote seemed scarcely creditable.</p>
<p>&lt;Credit, accredit.&gt; Though he is the official and credited
ambassador, his assertions are not accredited.</p>
<p>&lt;Cure, heal.&gt; I cured the dog's wounds. The physician declared he
could heal leprosy.</p>
<p>&lt;Custom, habit.&gt; "A custom more honor'd in the breach than the
observance." Is it your custom to watch the clock while you eat? The habit
in that region was to rise at cockcrow.</p>
<p>&lt;Decided, decisive.&gt; A decided battle. A decisive fault in manners.</p>
<p>&lt;Definite, definitive.&gt; We still await a definite edition of this
author's works. His answer was so definitive that we no longer doubted
what he meant.</p>
<p>&lt;Demesne, domain.&gt; Clive added India to the British demesne.
The king went riding through his personal domain.</p>
<p>&lt;Deprecate, depreciate.&gt; The German mark has deprecated in value. He
depreciated the praise they were lavishing upon him.</p>
<p>&lt;Descent, dissent.&gt; They tied themselves together with a rope in
order to make their dissent safer. The dissent to a lower plane of
conversation was what he most desired.</p>
<p>&lt;Discovery, invention.&gt; The discovery of the wireless telegraph is
Marconi's chief claim to remembrance. The invention of a water passage
between Tierra del Fuego and the mainland was the work of Magellan.</p>
<p>&lt;Discriminate, distinguish.&gt; He could not discriminate individuals at
that distance. Any man can distinguish right from wrong.</p>
<p>&lt;Disinterested, uninterested.&gt; His course was entirely generous and
disinterested. Most visitors to art galleries have an uninterested manner.</p>
<p>&lt;Disposal, disposition.&gt; This disposal of the matter is
authoritative, final. His disposition of his forces was well-considered.</p>
<p>&lt;Dissatisfied, discontented.&gt; Though the colonists were dissatisfied
for the moment, they could hardly be called discontented.</p>
<p>&lt;Distinct, distinctive.&gt; The distinct quality of his character was
aggressiveness. There were four separate and distinctive calls.</p>
<p>&lt;Dramatic, theatrical.&gt; An affected, dramatic manner. A truly
theatrical situation.</p>
<p>&lt;Dry, arid.&gt; A dry plain. An arid place to sleep in.</p>
<p>&lt;Dumb, mute.&gt; The man stood dumb with surprise. Always be kind to
mute animals.</p>
<p>&lt;Durable, lasting.&gt; Our joy is durable. Oak is a lasting wood.</p>

<p>    &lt;Parallels&gt;</p>
<p>Pairs of the third type are made up of words parallel in meaning. This
class somewhat overlaps the second; many terms that are frequently
confused are parallels, and parallelism is of course a cause of confusion.</p>
<p>Parallels are words that show likeness in meaning. Likeness, not sameness.
Yet at one time actual sameness may have existed, and in many instances
did. Nowadays this sameness has been lost, and the words have become
differentiated. As a rule they still are closely related in thought;
sometimes, however, the divergence between them is wide.</p>
<p>Why did words having the same meaning find lodgment in the language in the
first place? The law of linguistic economy forbids any such happening, and
only through sheer good fortune did English come to possess duplications.
The original Anglo-Saxon did not contain them. But the Roman Catholic
clergy brought to England the language of religion and of scholarship,
Latin. Later the Normans, whose speech as a branch of French was an
offshoot of Latin, came to the island as conquerors. For a time,
therefore, three languages existed side by side in the country—Anglo-
Saxon among the common folk, Latin among the clergy, and Norman-French at
the court and among the nobility. The coalescing of the three (or of the
two if we count Latin in its direct and indirect contributions as one) was
inevitable. But other (mostly cognate) languages also had a part in the
speech that was ultimately evolved. The Anglo-Saxon element was
augmented by words from Dutch, Scandinavian, and the Germanic tongues in
general; and Latin was reinforced by Greek. Thus to imply, as is
sometimes done, that modern English is simply a blend of Anglo-Saxon and
Latin elements is misleading. <emphasis>Native</emphasis> and <emphasis>classic</emphasis> are the better
terms to use, provided both are used broadly. <emphasis>Native</emphasis> must include not
only Anglo-Saxon but the other Germanic elements as well, and <emphasis>classic</emphasis>
must include French and Greek as well as Latin.</p>
<p>The welding of these languages made available two—in some instances more
than two—words for a single object or idea. What became of these
duplicates? Sometimes one of the words was dropped as needless.
Oftentimes, however, both were retained—with such modifications in
meaning that thereafter they designated, not the same object or idea, but
different forms or aspects of it. Thus they became parallels, and the new
language waxed rich with discriminations which neither of the component
tongues had possessed.</p>
<p>Scott in <emphasis>Ivanhoe</emphasis> gives the basis upon which the unification of the
languages proceeded. The jester Wamba in conversation with the swineherd
Gurth explains how the Anglo-Saxon term took on the homelier, rougher,
more workaday uses and left the more refined and fastidious uses for the
Norman-French. A domestic animal, says Wamba, was cared for by the
conquered people, and in consequence bore while living a "good Saxon"
name—swine, ox, or calf; but it was served at the tables of the
conquerors, and therefore when ready for consumption bore a "good
Norman-French" name—pork, beef, or veal. "When the brute [a sow] lives,
and is in charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name; but becomes
Norman and is called pork, when she is carried into the castle hall to
feast among the nobles…. He [a calf] is Saxon when he requires tendance,
and takes a Norman name [Monsieur de Veau] when he becomes matter of
enjoyment."</p>
<p>Let us see how Scott's contention fares if we extend his list of terms
relative to animal life. As throughout the rest of this chapter, with the
single and necessary exception of List B, the first word in each pair is
native, the second classic:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;LIST A&gt;</p>
<p>sheep, mutton          deer, venison        horse, equine
cow, bovine            bull, taurine        sheep, ovine
wolf, lupine           hog, porcine         bear, ursine
fox, vulpine           cat, feline          dog, canine
fish, piscatorial      mouse, vermin        rat, rodent
mankind, humanity      man, masculine       woman, feminine
childish, infantile    boyish, puerile</p>
<p>A glance at this list will show that, at least as regards animal life, the
native word is likely to be the more familiar and unpretentious. But we
must not leap to the conclusion that, taking the language as a whole, the
simple, easy word is sure to be native, the abstruse word classic. In the
following list one word in each pair is simpler, oftentimes much simpler,
than the other; yet both are of classic origin. (In some instances the two
are doublets; that is, they spring from the same stem.)</p>

<p>Again, the native word is sometimes less emphatic than the classic:</p>

<p>fly, soar             old, venerable         flood, cataclysm
steep, precipitous    wonder, astonishment   speed, velocity

hungry, famished      eat, devour            twisted, contorted
thin, emaciated       sad, lugubrious        mirth, hilarity</p>
<p>Despite these exceptions, the native word is in general better known
and more crudely powerful than the classic. Thus of the pair
<emphasis>sweat-perspiration</emphasis>, <emphasis>sweat</emphasis> is the plain-spoken, everyday member,
<emphasis>perspiration</emphasis> the polite, even learned member. The man of limited
vocabulary says <emphasis>sweat</emphasis>; even the sophisticated person, unless there
is occasion to soften effects, finds <emphasis>sweat</emphasis> the more natural term.
No one would say that a horse perspires. No one would say that human
beings must eat their bread in the perspiration of their faces. But
<emphasis>sweat</emphasis> is a word of connotation too vigorous (though honest withal)
for us to use the term in the drawing room. A questionable woman in <emphasis>The
Vicar of Wakefield</emphasis> betrays her lack of breeding by the remark that she
is in a muck of sweat.</p>
<p>The native word, besides being in itself simpler and starker than the
classic, makes stronger appeal to our feelings and affections. In nearly
every instance the objects and relationships that have woven themselves
into the very texture of our lives are designated by native terms. Even if
they are not so designated solely, they are so designated in their more
cherished aspects. We warm more to the native <emphasis>fatherly</emphasis> than to the
classic <emphasis>paternal</emphasis>. We have a deeper sentiment for the native
<emphasis>home</emphasis> than for the classic <emphasis>residence</emphasis>.</p>
<p>That the native is the more downright term may be seen from the following
words. (These pairs are of course merely illustrative. With them might be
grouped a few special pairs, like <emphasis>devilish-diabolical</emphasis> and
<emphasis>church</emphasis>-<emphasis>ecclesiastical</emphasis>, of which the first members are
classic in origin but of such early naturalization into English that they
may be regarded as native.)</p>

<p>The fact that English is a double-barreled language, and that of parallel
terms one is likely to be native and the other classic, is interesting in
itself. Our lists of parallels, however, though (with the exception of
List B) they are arranged to bring out this duality of origin, have other
and more vital uses as material for exercises. For after all it matters
little whether we know where a word comes from, provided we know
thoroughly the meaning and implications of the word itself. The lists
already given and those to follow show the more important words actually
yoked as parallels. Your task must be to ascertain the differences in
import between the words thus joined.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Parallels</p>
<p>&lt;LIST G&gt;</p>
<p>Study the discriminations between the members of the following pairs. At
each blank in the illustrative sentences insert the appropriate word.</p>
<p>&lt;Brotherly, fraternal.&gt; <emphasis>Brotherly</emphasis> is used of actual blood
kinship, or indicates close feeling, deep affection, or religious love.
<emphasis>Fraternal</emphasis> is used less personally and intimately; it normally
betokens that the relations are at least in part formal (as relations
within societies). "The sight of the button on the stranger's lapel caused
Wilkes to give him the cabalistic sign and ask his ____ assistance."
"Though the children of different parents, we bear for each other a true
____ devotion." "Because we both are newspaper men I feel a ____ interest
in him."</p>
<p>&lt;Daily, diurnal.&gt; <emphasis>Daily</emphasis>, the popular word, is often used
loosely. We may say that we eat three meals daily without implying that we
have never gone dinnerless. <emphasis>Diurnal</emphasis>, the scientific term, is used
exactly, whether applying to the period of daylight or to the whole
twenty-four hours. A diurnal flower closes at night; a diurnal motion is
precisely coincident with the astronomical day. In poetry, however,
<emphasis>diurnal</emphasis> is often used for <emphasis>daily</emphasis>. "Give us this day our ____
bread." "The ____ rotation of the earth on its axis is the cause of our
day and night." "Fred and I went for our ____ ramble through the hills."</p>
<p>&lt;Cold, frigid.&gt; Which is the more popular word? Let us see. Would the
man in the street be more likely to use one than the other? Which one?
Does this answer our question? Another question: Which word is the more
inclusive in meaning? Again, let us see. A blacksmith is beating iron;
does the iron grow cold or frigid? Which term, then, approaches the closer
in meaning to the idea of mere coolness? On the other hand, may that same
term represent a temperature far beyond mere coolness? Would you speak of
a morning as bitterly cold or bitterly frigid? Now think of the term you
have not been using. <emphasis>Can</emphasis> it convey as wide meanings, or is it
limited in range? Does the word <emphasis>frigid</emphasis> carry for you a geographical
suggestion (to the frigid zone)? Do you yourself use the term? If so, do
you use it chiefly (perhaps entirely) in connection with human temperament
or demeanor? Is <emphasis>cold</emphasis> used thus figuratively also? Which is the more
often thus used? "I suffer from ____ hands and feet." "The slopes of Mont
Blanc are ____ with eternal snow." "He did not warm to the idea at all.
His inclinations are absolutely ____."</p>
<p>&lt;Manly, virile&gt;. <emphasis>Manly</emphasis> implies possession of traits or
qualities a man should possess; it may be used of immature persons.
<emphasis>Virile</emphasis> implies maturity and robust masculinity; it is also used of
the power to procreate. "A ____ lad." "A ____ reply." "____ energy."
"____ and aggressive." "____ forbearance."</p>
<p>&lt;Inner, internal&gt;. <emphasis>Inner</emphasis> is somewhat within, or more within
than something else is; it is also used in figurative and spiritual
senses. <emphasis>Internal</emphasis> is entirely within. "The ____ organs of the human
body." "The ____ layer of the rind." "The injury was ____."
"The ____ nature of man." "The ____ meaning of the occurrence."</p>
<p>&lt;Height, altitude&gt;. "He was five feet, eleven inches in height."
Can you substitute <emphasis>altitude</emphasis>? Is <emphasis>altitude</emphasis> used of persons?
"At an altitude of eleven feet from the ground." Would <emphasis>height</emphasis> be
more natural? Does <emphasis>altitude</emphasis> betoken great height? If so, does
Hamlet speak jestingly when he greets the player, "Your ladyship is nearer
heaven than when I saw you last, by the altitude of a chopine?" What of
the sentence: "The altitude of Galveston was not sufficient to protect it
from the tidal wave"? Does the magnitude or importance of the object
(Galveston) compensate for its lack of elevation and thus justify
<emphasis>altitude</emphasis>? Could <emphasis>height</emphasis> be substituted? If so, would the
words <emphasis>above sea-level</emphasis> have to follow it? Does this fact give you a
further clue as to the distinction between the two words? You are
comparing the elevation of two peaks, both plainly visible; you measure
them merely by your eye. Do you say "This exceeds the other in height" or
"This exceeds the other in altitude"? Suppose the peaks are so distant
from each other that the two are not visible simultaneously, and suppose
you are speaking from a knowledge of the scientific measurements. Do you
say "This exceeds the other in height" or "This exceeds the other in
altitude"?</p>
<p>&lt;Talk, conversation&gt;. <emphasis>Talk</emphasis> may be one-sided and empty.
<emphasis>Conversation</emphasis> requires that at least two shall participate, and it
is not spoken of as empty, though it may be trivial. "Our ____ was
somewhat desultory." "Thought is less general than ____."
"His ____ was so lively that I had no chance to interrupt"
"That is meaningless ____."</p>
<p>&lt;Homesickness, nostalgia&gt;. All of us have heard physicians call
commonplace ailments by extraordinary names. When homesickness reaches the
stage where a physician is or might be called in, it becomes nostalgia.
The latter term suggests morbid or chronic suffering. A healthy boy away
from home for the first time is homesick. An exile who has wasted himself
with pining for his native land is nostalgic. "His ____ was more than
____; it had so preyed upon his thoughts that it had grown into ____."</p>
<p>Rise, ascend. <emphasis>Rise</emphasis> is the more general term, but it expresses less
than <emphasis>ascend</emphasis> in degree or stateliness. "He had foretold to them that
he would ____ into heaven." "Do not ____ from your seat." "The diver
slowly ____ to the surface." "The travelers ____ the mountain."</p>
<p>&lt;Sell, vend&gt;. <emphasis>Sell</emphasis> is the more dignified word socially, but
may express greater moral degradation. <emphasis>Vend</emphasis> is used of the petty
(as that which can be carried about in a wagon), and may suggest the
pettily dishonest. "That man would ____ his country." "We shall ____ a
million dollars' worth of goods." "The hucksters ____ their wares."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;LIST H&gt;</p>
<p>Study the discriminations between the members of the following pairs.
Determine whether the words are correctly used in the illustrative
sentences. (Some are; some are not.)</p>
<p>&lt;Friendly, amicable&gt;. <emphasis>Friendly</emphasis> denotes goodwill positive in
quality though perhaps limited in degree; we may be friendly to friends,
enemies, or strangers. <emphasis>Amicable</emphasis> is negative, denoting absence of
open discord: it is used of those persons between whom some connection
already exists. "The newcomer has an amicable manner." "Both sides were
cautious, but at last they reached a friendly settlement." "I have only
amicable feelings for an enemy who is thus merciful." "The two met, if not
in a friendly, at least in an amicable way."</p>
<p>&lt;Willing, voluntary&gt;. Both words imply an act of the will; but
<emphasis>willing</emphasis> adds positive good-nature, desire, or enthusiasm, whereas
<emphasis>voluntary</emphasis> conveys little or nothing of the emotional attitude.
<emphasis>Voluntary</emphasis> is often thought of in contrast with <emphasis>mechanical</emphasis>.
"They made willing submission." "They rendered whole-hearted and voluntary
service." "Though torn by desire to return to his mother, he willingly
continued his journey away from her." "The sneeze was unwilling."</p>
<p>&lt;Greedy, voracious.&gt; <emphasis>Greedy</emphasis> denotes excessiveness (usually
habitual) of appetite or, in its figurative uses, of desire; it nearly
always carries the idea of selfishness. <emphasis>Voracious</emphasis> denotes intense
hunger or the hasty and prolonged consumption of great quantities of food;
it may indicate, not habitual selfishness, but the stress of
circumstances. "Nobody else I know is so greedy as he." "The young poet
was voracious of praise." "Trench, though a capital fellow, was so hungry
that he ate voraciously."</p>
<p>&lt;Offspring, progeny.&gt; <emphasis>Offspring</emphasis> is likely to be used when our
thought is chiefly on the children, <emphasis>progeny</emphasis> when our thought is
chiefly on the parents. <emphasis>Offspring</emphasis> may be used of one or many;
<emphasis>progeny</emphasis> is used in collective reference to many. "He was third
among the progeny who won distinction." "They are the progeny of very rich
parents." "Clayton left his offspring well provided for."</p>
<p>&lt;Ghost, spirit.&gt; <emphasis>Ghost</emphasis> is the narrower term. It never
expresses, as <emphasis>spirit</emphasis> does, the idea of soul or of animating mood or
purpose. With reference to incorporeal beings, it denotes (except in the
phrase "the Holy Ghost") the reappearance of the dead in disembodied form.
<emphasis>Spirit</emphasis> may denote a variety of incorporeal beings—among them
angels, fairies (devoid of moral nature), and personalities returned from
the grave and manifested—seldom visibly—through spiritualistic tappings
and the like. "The superstitious natives thought the spirit of their chief
walked in the graveyard." "The ghost of the ancestors survives in the
descendants." "I can call spirits from the vasty deep."</p>
<p>&lt;Foe, enemy.&gt; Nowadays the chief difference between the two terms is
that <emphasis>foe</emphasis> is the more used in poetry, <emphasis>enemy</emphasis> in prose.
But <emphasis>foe</emphasis> tends to express the more personal and implacable
hostility. We do not think of foes as bearing any friendship for each
other; enemies may, or they may be enemies in public affairs but downright
friends in their private relations. A man is hardly spoken of as being his
own foe, but he may be his own enemy. "For the moment we found ourselves
foes." "Suspicion is an enemy to content." "I paid a tribute to my friend,
who was the dominant personality among the enemy."</p>
<p>&lt;Truth, veracity.&gt; <emphasis>Truth</emphasis> has to do with the accuracy of the
statement, of the facts; <emphasis>veracity</emphasis> with the intention of the person
to say nothing false. "I cannot vouch for the veracity of the story, but I
can for the truth of the teller." "Though he is not a man of veracity, I
believe he is now speaking the truth." "Veracity, crushed to earth, will
rise again."</p>
<p>&lt;Break, fracture&gt;. <emphasis>Break</emphasis> is the broader term. It need not
refer clearly to the operation or result of external force, nor need it
embody the idea that this force is brought against a hard substance. In
these respects it differs from <emphasis>fracture</emphasis>, as also in the fact that
it may designate a mere interruption. Furthermore it has figurative uses,
whereas <emphasis>fracture</emphasis> is narrowly literal. "There was a fracture in the
chain of mountains." "The break in his voice was distinct." "The fracture
of the bones of his wrist incapacitated him." "The fracture of the rope."</p>
<p>&lt;Hug, embrace&gt;. To <emphasis>hug</emphasis> is to clasp violently or
enthusiastically, and perhaps ludicrously. To <emphasis>embrace</emphasis> is to clasp
in a more dignified, perhaps even in a formal, way; the term also means to
include, to comprise. "This topic embraces the other." "Did you see that
ardent bumpkin embracing his sweetheart?" "Her sister gave her a graceful
but none too cordial hug." "The wounded bear hugged the hunter
ferociously."</p>
<p>&lt;Shorten, abridge&gt;. The two terms overlap; but there is a fairly
strong tendency to use <emphasis>shorten</emphasis> for reduction in length, and
<emphasis>abridge</emphasis> for reduction in quantity or mass. Both words are used
figuratively as well as literally. "The tyrant shortened the privileges of
his subjects." "We shortened the rope." "The teacher abridged the
recitation." "The report of the committee appears in abridged form in
Volume 2 of our records."</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>With the help of the dictionary discriminate between the members of the
following pairs. Determine whether the words are correctly used in the
illustrative sentences. (Some are; some are not.)</p>
<p>&lt;Fiery, inflammable&gt;. "He delivered a fiery address." "The
underbrush was dry and fiery." "Your disposition is too inflammable."</p>
<p>&lt;Lean, attenuated&gt;. "The fat man had grown attenuated."
"Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look." "The hot metal was then drawn
into an attenuated wire." "Only a lean line of our soldiers faced the
dense masses of the enemy."</p>
<p>&lt;Home-like, domestic&gt;. "The scene was quiet and domestic." "It is
home-like, inexpressibly dear." "To Waltham, heartsick from his
wanderings, the room in all its arrangements was thoroughly domestic."</p>
<p>&lt;Vigilant, watchful&gt;. "We must be vigilant if we would maintain our
liberty." "He was wakeful, even watchful, though not from set purpose."
"He was vigilant for evidences of friendship."</p>
<p>&lt;Building, edifice&gt;. "It is a big, barn-like building." "Spare yonder
sacred edifice." "This is the most imposing building I ever saw."</p>
<p>&lt;Hole, aperture&gt;. "I poked a stick into the aperture which the
crawfish had made." "Through the aperture of the partly open door I gazed
out on the street." "The hole of the hornet's nest was black with the
emerging and angry insects."</p>
<p>&lt;Farming, agriculture&gt;. "Two hundred students graduated this year
from the college of farming." "For long years he had devoted himself to
the homely, grinding tasks of agriculture." "I have looked rather
carefully into the theories of farming."</p>
<p>&lt;Rest, repose&gt;. "He obtained some repose even while standing." "We
wished for a moment's rest from our exertions." "Worn out, he was
compelled to seek repose." "Lincoln's face in repose was very melancholy."</p>
<p>&lt;Help, aid&gt;. "The man was so injured he could do nothing for himself;
I had to aid him." "Help, help!" "Aid us, O God, in our sore distress."
"The little fellow could not quite get the bundle to his shoulder; a
passerby helped him."</p>
<p>&lt;Hide, conceal&gt;. "By refraining from comment he hid his connection
with the affair." "Wild creatures hide themselves by means of their
protective coloring." "The frost on the panes conceals the landscape from
you." "Do not hide your misdeeds from your mother."</p>

<p><strong>    SYNONYMS IN LARGER GROUPS (1)</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In considering pairs we have, without using the word, been studying
synonyms. For most pairs are synonyms (or in some instances antonyms) that
hunt in couples. We must now deal with synonyms, and incidentally
antonyms, as they associate themselves in larger groups.</p>
<p>A vocabulary is impoverished. Why? Nine times in ten, because of a
disregard of synonyms. Listen to the talk of the average person. Whatever
is pleasing is <emphasis>fine</emphasis> or <emphasis>nice</emphasis> or <emphasis>all to the good</emphasis>;
whatever is displeasing is <emphasis>bum</emphasis> or <emphasis>awful</emphasis> or <emphasis>a fright</emphasis>.
Life is reflected, not as noble and complex, but as mean and meager. Out
of such stereotyped utterance only the general idea emerges. The precise
meaning is lazily or incompetently left to the hearer to imagine. The
precise meaning? There is none. A person who does not take the trouble to
speak clearly has not taken the trouble to think clearly.</p>
<p>But the master of synonyms expresses, instead of general, hazy,
commonplace conceptions, the subtlest shadings of thought and feeling. He
has so trained himself that he selects, it may be unconsciously, from a
throng of possible words. One word may be strong, another weak. One may be
broad, another narrow. One may present an alternative in meanings, another
permit no liberty of choice. One may be suggestive, another literal or
colorless. One may penetrate to the core of the idea, another strike only
in the environs. With these possibilities the master of synonyms reckons.
He must have the right word. He chooses it, not at haphazard, but in
conformity with a definite purpose.</p>
<p>For synonyms are not words that have the same meaning. They are words that
have similar meanings. They may be compared to circles that overlap but do
not coincide. Each embraces a common area, but each embraces also an area
peculiar to itself. Though many words cluster about a given idea, rarely
if ever are even two of these words entirely equivalent to each other. In
scope, in suggestion, in emotional nuance, in special usage, or what not,
is sure to lurk some denial of perfect correspondence. And of synonyms, so
of antonyms. Antonyms are words opposite in meaning; but the opposition,
for the same reasons as the likeness, is seldom or never absolute.</p>
<p>In your study of synonyms you will find most of the dictionaries
previously named of great help. You may also profitably consult the
following books of synonyms (heavy, scholastic works not suited for
ordinary use are omitted):</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Books of Plain Synonyms and Antonyms&gt;</p>
<p>Edith B. Ordway: <emphasis>Synonyms and Antonyms</emphasis>. A compact, practical
volume, with antonyms (in italics for contrast) immediately following
synonyms.</p>
<p>Louis A. Flemming: <emphasis>Putnam's Word Book</emphasis>. A book of the ordinarily
used synonyms of words, with antonyms after some of them, and with lists
of associated words wherever these are likely to be useful.</p>
<p>Samuel Fallows: <emphasis>100,000 Synonyms and Antonyms</emphasis>. A handy little
volume, with useful lists of various kinds in appendices.</p>
<p>Richard Soule: <emphasis>Dictionary of English Synonyms</emphasis> [revised and enlarged
by George H. Howison]. A much larger and more expensive book than the
others, and less practical for ordinary use, but fuller in treatment of
material, with words of more than one meaning carefully divided into their
various senses.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Synonyms with Word Discriminations&gt;</p>
<p>George Crabb: <emphasis>English Synonyms</emphasis>. A standard volume for over 100
years. Has close distinctions, but is somewhat scholarly for ordinary use.
Revised edition of 1917, omitting illustrative quotations from literature,
not so good as editions before that date.</p>
<p>James C. Fernald: <emphasis>English Synonyms, Antonyms, and Prepositions</emphasis>.
A pleasing book to read, with much information about the use of words and
their shades of meaning (with exercises), also with proper prepositions to
follow words. Material taken from the <emphasis>Standard Dictionary</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Peter Mark Roget: <emphasis>Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases</emphasis>. Issued in
many editions and revisions. Words grouped under general ideas. An
excellent book for serious and laborious study, but not for quick use.</p>

<p>&lt;How to Acquire Synonyms&gt;</p>
<p>The best principle for the extension of one's mastery of synonyms is the
principle already used over and over in this book—that of proceeding from
the known to the unknown. It is the fundamental principle, indeed, of any
kind of successful learning. We should build on what we have, fit each new
piece of material into the structure already erected. But normally it is
our ill fortune to learn through chance rather than through system. We
perceive elucidation here, draw an inference there. These isolated
fragments of knowledge may mislead rather than inform us.</p>
<p>The principle of proceeding from the known to the unknown may be applied
to synonyms in various ways. Two of these—the two of most importance—we
must consider here.</p>
<p>First, you should reckon with your personal, demonstrated needs. Just as
you have already analyzed your working vocabulary for its general limits
and shortcomings, so should you analyze it with particular reference to
your poverty in synonyms. Watch your actual speech; make a list of the
words—nouns, verbs, and adjectives particularly—that you employ again
and again. Make each of these words the starting-point for a linguistic
exploring expedition. First, write the word down. Then under it write all
the synonyms that come forthwith to your mind. These constitute your
present available stock; in speaking or writing you could, if you kept
yourself mentally alert, summon them on the moment. But the list, as you
know, is not exhaustive. Draw a line under it and subjoin such synonyms as
come to you after reflection. These constitute a second stock, not
instantaneously available, yet to be tagged as among your resources. Next
add a list of the synonyms you find through research, through a ransacking
of dictionaries and books of synonyms. This third stock, but dimly
familiar if familiar at all, is in no practical sense yours. And indeed
some of the words are too abstruse, learned, or technical for you to
burden your memory with them. But many—most—are worth acquiring. By
writing down the words of these three classes you have done something to
stamp them upon your memory as associates. You must now make it your
business to bring them into use. Never call upon them for volunteers, but
like a wise commander summon the individual that can rightly perform a
particular service. Thus will your speech, perhaps vague and indolent now,
become exact, discriminating, competent, vital.</p>
<p>In the second place, you should obtain specific and detailed command of
general ideas. Not of out-of-the-way ideas. But of the great basic ideas
that are the common possession of all mankind. For through these basic
ideas is the most natural and profitable approach to the study of
synonyms. Each of them is represented by a generic word. So elementary are
idea and word alike that a person cannot have the one in mind without
having the other ready and a-quiver on his tongue. Every person is master
of both. But it is unsafe to predicate the person's acquaintance with the
shades and phases of the idea, or with the corresponding discriminations
in language. He may not know them at all, he may know them partially, he
may know them through and through. Let us suppose him ignorant of them but
determined to learn. His progress, both in the thought and in the
language, will be from the general to the specific. His acquaintance with
the idea in the large he will gradually extend to an acquaintance with it
in detail, and his command of the broad term for it he will little by
little supplement with definite terms for its phases. An illustration will
make this clear.</p>
<p>We are aware that the world is made up of various classes and conditions
of men. How did we learn this? Let us go back to the time when our minds
were a blank, when we were babes and sucklings, when we had not perceived
that men exist, much less that mankind is infinitely complex. A baby comes
slowly to understand that all objects in the universe are divisible into
two classes, human and non-human, and that a member of the former may be
separated from the others and regarded as an individual. It has reached
the initial stage of its knowledge on the subject; it has the basic idea,
that of the individual human being. As soon as it can speak, it acquires a
designating term—not of course the sophisticated <emphasis>human being</emphasis>, but
the simpler <emphasis>man</emphasis>. It uses this word in the generic sense, to
indicate <emphasis>any</emphasis> member of the human race; for as yet it knows nothing
and cares nothing about differences in species. With increasing
enlightenment, however, it discerns five species, and distinguishes among
them by swelling this branch of its vocabulary to five words: man (in the
sense of adult male), woman, boy, girl, baby. (To be sure, it may chance
to have acquired a specific term, as <emphasis>boy</emphasis> or <emphasis>baby</emphasis>, before the
generic term <emphasis>man</emphasis>; but if so, it has attached this term to some
particular individual, as the grocer's boy or itself, rather than to the
individuals of a species. Its understanding of the species as a species
comes after its understanding of the genus.) As time passes, it divides
mankind into yet further species by sundry other methods: according to
occupation, for example, as doctors, chauffeurs, gardeners; to race or
color, as white men; negroes, Malays, Chinese; to disposition, as heroes,
gift-givers, teasers, talkers; and so on. It perceives moreover that
species are made up of sub-species. Thus instead of lumping all boys
together it begins to distinguish them as big boys, little boys,
middle-sized boys, boys in long trousers, boys in short trousers, barefoot
boys, schoolboys, poor boys, rich boys, sick boys, well boys, friends,
enemies, bullies, and what not. It even divides the sub-species. Thus it
classifies schoolboys as bright boys, dullards, workers, shirkers,
teachers' favorites, scapegoats, athletes, note-throwers, truant-players,
and the like. And of these classes it may make yet further sub-divisions,
or at least it may separate them into the individuals that compose them.
In fine, with its growing powers and experience, it abandons its old
conception that all persons are practically alike, and follows human
nature through the countless ramifications of man's status, temperament,
activities, or fate. And it augments its vocabulary to keep pace, roughly
at least, with its expanding ideas. In thought and terminology alike its
growth is from genus to species.</p>
<p>So it is with all our ideas and with all our words to cap them. We radiate
from an ascertained center into new areas of knowledge; we proceed from
the broad, fundamental, generic to the precise, discriminatory, specific.
Upon this natural law are based the exercises in this chapter and the two
to follow. The starting-point is always a word representative of an
elementary idea—a word and an idea which everybody knows; the advance is
into the unknown or the unused, at any rate into the particular. Now
fundamental ideas are not very numerous, and these exercises include the
commoner ones. Such a method of studying synonyms must therefore yield
large and tangible results.</p>
<p>One matter, however, should be explained. Most books of synonyms start
with a word and list all the terms in any way related to it. The idea of
the compilers is that the more they give the student the more they help
him. But oftentimes by giving more than is strictly pertinent they
actually hinder and confuse him. They may do this in various ways, of
which two must be mentioned. First, they follow an idea too far afield.
Thus in listing the synonyms of <emphasis>love</emphasis> they include such terms as
<emphasis>kindness</emphasis> and <emphasis>lenity</emphasis>, words only through stretched usage
connected with <emphasis>love</emphasis>. Secondly, they trace, not one meaning of a
word, but two or more unrelated meanings when the word chances to possess
them. Thus in listing the synonyms of <emphasis>cry</emphasis> they include both the
idea of weeping and the idea of calling or screaming. What are the results
of these methods? The student finds a clutter where he expects
rationalized order; he finds he must exclude many words which lie in the
borders and fringes of the meaning. Moreover he finds mere chance
associations mingled with marked kinships. In both cases he finds dulled
distinctions.</p>
<p>This book offers synonyms that are apropos and definite rather than
comprehensive. Starting with a basic idea, it finds the generic term; it
then disregards dim and distant relationships, confines itself rigorously
to one of perhaps two or three legitimate senses, and refuses to consider
the peculiar twists and devious ways of subsidiary words when they wander
from the idea it is tracing. It thus deliberately blinds itself to much
that is interesting. But this partial blindness enables it to concentrate
attention upon the matter actually under study, to give sharper
distinctions and surer guidance.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>EXERCISE A</strong></p>
<p>After three introductory groups (dealing with thoroughly concrete ideas
and words) the synonyms in this exercise are arranged alphabetically
according to the first word in each group.</p>
<p>This first word is generic. It is immediately followed by a list of its
synonyms. These are then informally discriminated or else (in a few
instances) questions are asked about them. Perhaps a few less closely
related synonyms are then listed for you to discriminate in a similar way.
Finally, illustrative sentences are given. Each blank in these you are to
fill with the word that conveys the meaning exactly. (To prevent monotony
and inattention, the number of illustrative sentences varies. You may have
to use a particular word more than once, and another word not at all.)</p>

<p>&lt;Walk, plod, trudge, tread, stride, stalk, strut, tramp, march, pace,
toddle, waddle, shuffle, mince, stroll, saunter, ramble, meander,
promenade, prowl, hobble, limp, perambulate.&gt;</p>
<p>Any one may be said to <emphasis>walk</emphasis> who moves along on foot with moderate
speed. He <emphasis>plods</emphasis> if he walks slowly and heavily, and perhaps
monotonously or spiritlessly as well. He <emphasis>trudges</emphasis> if he walks
toilsomely and wearily, as though his feet were heavy. He <emphasis>treads</emphasis> if
his walk is suggestive of a certain lightness and caution—if, for
instance, he seems half-uncertain whether to proceed and sets one foot
down carefully before the other. He <emphasis>strides</emphasis> if he takes long steps,
especially in a firm, pompous, or lofty manner. He <emphasis>stalks</emphasis> if there
is a certain stiffness or haughtiness in his walking. He <emphasis>struts</emphasis> if
he walks with a proud or affectedly dignified gait, especially if he also
raises his feet high. He <emphasis>tramps</emphasis> if he goes for a long walk, as for
pleasure or enjoyment out-of-doors. He <emphasis>marches</emphasis> if he walks in a
measured, ordered way, especially in company with others. He <emphasis>paces</emphasis>
if he engages in a measured, continuous walk, as from nervousness,
impatience, or anger. He <emphasis>toddles</emphasis> if his steps are short, uneven,
and unsteady, like those of a child. He <emphasis>waddles</emphasis> if his movement is
ungainly, with a duck-like swaying from side to side. He <emphasis>shuffles</emphasis>
if he drags his feet with a scraping noise. He <emphasis>minces</emphasis> if he takes
short steps in a prim, precise, or affectedly nice manner. He
<emphasis>strolls</emphasis> or <emphasis>saunters</emphasis> if he goes along in an easy, aimless, or
idle fashion. He <emphasis>rambles</emphasis> if he wanders about, with no definite aim
or toward no definite goal. He <emphasis>meanders</emphasis> if he proceeds slowly and
perhaps listlessly in an ever-changing course, as if he were following the
windings of the crooked Phrygian river, Meander. He <emphasis>promenades</emphasis> if
he walks in a public place, as for pleasure or display. He <emphasis>prowls</emphasis>
if he moves about softly and stealthily, as in search of prey or booty. He
<emphasis>hobbles</emphasis> if he jerks along unevenly, as from a stiff or crippled
condition of body. He <emphasis>limps</emphasis> if he walks lamely. He
<emphasis>perambulates</emphasis> when he walks through, perhaps for observation or
inspection. <emphasis>(Perambulates</emphasis> is of course a learned word.)</p>

<p>&lt;Laugh, giggle, snicker, titter, chuckle, guffaw, cachinnate.&gt;</p>
<p>What differences in human nature, conditions, and disposition are revealed
by laughter! If a person gives audible expression to mirth, gayety, or
good-humor, the simplest word to apply to what he does is <emphasis>laugh</emphasis>.
But suppose a girl, with slight or insufficient provocation, engages in
silly or foolish though perhaps involuntary laughter. We should say she
<emphasis>giggles</emphasis>. Suppose a youngster is amused at an inappropriate moment
and but partly suppresses his laughter; or suppose he wilfully permits the
breaking forth of just enough laughter to indicate disrespect. He
<emphasis>snickers</emphasis>. Suppose a person gives a little, light laugh; or more
especially, suppose a crowd gives such an one as the result of slight,
simultaneous amusement. Our word now is <emphasis>titters</emphasis>. Suppose we laugh
low or gently or to ourselves. We <emphasis>chuckle</emphasis>. Suppose some one laughs
loudly, boisterously, even coarsely, in a manner befitting a lumber camp
rather than a drawing room. That person <emphasis>guffaws</emphasis>. Suppose a man
engages in explosive and immoderate laughter. He <emphasis>cachinnates</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;chortle, roar&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Second assignment</emphasis>: Name all the words you can that designate
inaudible laughter (for example, &lt;smile, smirk, grin&gt;).</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: The rough fellow ____ in the lecturer's face. "If you

<p>&lt;Look, glance, gaze, stare, peer, scan, scrutinize, gloat, glare,
glower, lower, peek, peep, gape, con, pore, ogle.&gt;</p>
<p>A person simply directs his eyes to see. He <emphasis>looks</emphasis>. But eyes may
speak, we are told, and since this person undergoes many changes of mood
and purpose, we shall let his eyes tell us all they will about his
different manners of looking. At first he but looks momentarily (as from
lack of time) or casually (as from lack of interest). He <emphasis>glances</emphasis>.
Soon he makes a business of looking, and fastens his eyes for a long time
on something he admires or wonders at. He <emphasis>gazes</emphasis>. Presently he looks
with a blank, perhaps a rude, expression and with eyes opened widely; he
may be for the moment overcome with incomprehension, surprise, or fright,
or perhaps he wishes to be insolent. He <emphasis>stares</emphasis>. Now he is looking
narrowly or closely at something that he sees with difficulty. He
<emphasis>peers</emphasis>. The next moment he looks over something with care or with an
encompassing sweep of vision. He <emphasis>scans</emphasis> it. His interest thoroughly
enlisted, he looks at it carefully point by point to see that it is right
in each detail. He <emphasis>scrutinizes</emphasis> it. He then alters his mood, and
looks with scornful or malignant satisfaction upon something he has
conquered or has power over. He <emphasis>gloats</emphasis>. Anger, perhaps fierceness,
takes possession of him, and he looks with piercing eyes. He
<emphasis>glares</emphasis>. Threat mingles with anger, and in all likelihood he looks
scowlingly or frowningly. He <emphasis>glowers</emphasis>. An added expression of
sullenness or gloom comes into his look. He <emphasis>lowers</emphasis>. He throws off
his dark spirit and looks slyly and playfully, let us say through a small
opening. He <emphasis>peeks</emphasis>. Playfulness gives place to curiosity; he looks
quickly and furtively, perhaps through some tiny aperture, and probably at
something he has no business to see. He <emphasis>peeps</emphasis>. The while he looks
his mouth falls open, as from stupidity or wonder. He <emphasis>gapes</emphasis>. He
looks at something a long time to study it. He <emphasis>cons</emphasis> or
<emphasis>pores</emphasis>. His study is not of the thing itself; it is meditation or
reverie. He <emphasis>pores</emphasis>. A member of the opposite sex is present; he
looks at her with the effort of a flirt to attract attention to himself,
or less scrupulous, he directs toward her amorous or inviting glances. He
<emphasis>ogles</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;leer, view, survey,

<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: The inspecting officer ____ the men's equipment. The
student ____ his lessons carefully. At this unexpected proposal Dobbett
merely ____. Jimmie ____ at the fellow who had kicked the pup. The
inquisitive maid ____ into all the the closets. He ____ over his fallen
adversary. The bookkeeper ____ over his ledger. In the darkened hallway he
____ at the notices on the bulletin board. "The poet's eye, in a fine
frenzy rolling, Doth ____ from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven."
From the way her father ____ the foolish, young man should have known it
was time to go. He ____ long and lovingly upon the scenes he was leaving.
The newcomer ____ insolently at his host and ____ the young ladies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Abandon, desert, forsake.&gt;</p>
<p><emphasis>Abandon</emphasis> denotes absolute giving up, as from force of circumstances
or shirking of responsibility. <emphasis>Desert</emphasis> refers to leaving or quitting
in violation of obligation, duty, or oath. <emphasis>Forsake</emphasis>, which may
involve no culpability, usually implies a breaking off of intimate
association or attachment.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: The sailor ____ his ship. Necessity compelled him to
____ his friends in a time of sore trouble. They hated to ____ their old
haunts. A brave man never ____ hope. An unscrupulous man will ____ his
principles when it is to his advantage. "When my father and my mother ____
me, then the Lord will take me up." We ____ our attempt to save the ship.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Abase, debase, degrade, humble, humiliate, disgrace.&gt;</p>
<p>To <emphasis>abase</emphasis> is to bring down so that the victim feels himself lowered
in estate or external condition. To <emphasis>debase</emphasis> is to produce a marked
decline in actual worth or in moral quality. To <emphasis>degrade</emphasis> is to lower
in rank or status. To <emphasis>humble</emphasis> is to lower in dignity or self-esteem,
or as used reflexively, to restrain one's own pride; the word often
implies that the person has been over-proud or arrogant. To
<emphasis>humiliate</emphasis> is to deprive of self-esteem or to bring into ignominy.
To <emphasis>disgrace</emphasis> is to bring actual shame upon.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: They ____ the guilty officer from captain to lieutenant.
A man should ____ himself before God. He had so ____ himself that I no
longer expected good of him. His detection at cheating had ____ him before
the students. By successive overlords they had been ____ into a condition
of serfdom. The aristocratic old lady was ____ by her loss of social
position. The conversion of so much bullion into money had ____ the
coinage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Answer, reply, response, rejoinder, retort, repartee.&gt;</p>
<p>An interesting thing about the <emphasis>answer</emphasis> group is that the generic
term has a somewhat strong rival in <emphasis>reply</emphasis>, itself fairly inclusive.
We must therefore discriminate rather fully between <emphasis>answer</emphasis> and
<emphasis>reply</emphasis>. The former is a return in words to a question, a
communication, or an argument. The latter suggests a more or less formal
answer, as one carefully prepared or intelligently thought out. We might
give an <emphasis>answer</emphasis> offhand, but are less likely to give a <emphasis>reply</emphasis>
so. We may give any kind of <emphasis>answer</emphasis> to a question, but if we give a
<emphasis>reply</emphasis>, the implication is that we have answered it definitely,
perhaps satisfactorily. On the other hand, in controversial matters we
may, though we by no means always do, imply a more conclusive meeting of
objections through <emphasis>answer</emphasis> than through <emphasis>reply</emphasis>. A
<emphasis>response</emphasis> is an expected answer, one in harmony with the question or
assertion, or in some way carrying the thought farther. A <emphasis>rejoinder</emphasis>
is a quick reply to something controversial or calling forth opposition.
A <emphasis>retort</emphasis> is a short, sharp reply, such as turns back censure or
derision, or as springs from anger. A <emphasis>repartee</emphasis> is an immediate and
witty reply, perhaps to a remark of similar character which it is intended
to surpass in cleverness.</p>

<p>&lt;Ask, inquire, question, interrogate, interpellate, query, quiz,
catechize, request, beg, solicit, entreat, beseech, crave, implore,
supplicate, importune, petition.&gt;</p>
<p>From the general tree of asking grow many branches, different in size, in
the direction they take, in the shades of meaning they cast. What can we
learn from a rapid scrutiny of each? That to <emphasis>inquire</emphasis> is to ask for
specific information. That to <emphasis>question</emphasis> is to keep asking in order
to obtain detailed or reluctantly given information. That to
<emphasis>interrogate</emphasis> is to question formally, systematically, or thoroughly.

question because of doubt as to its correctness or truth. That to

meddlesomeness, opposition, or curiosity. That to <emphasis>catechize</emphasis> is to
question in a minute, perhaps impertinent, manner in order to ascertain
one's secrets or the amount of his knowledge or information. That to
<emphasis>request</emphasis> is to ask formally and politely. That to <emphasis>beg</emphasis> is to
ask for deferentially or humbly, especially on the ground of pity. That to
<emphasis>solicit</emphasis> is to ask with urgency. That to <emphasis>entreat</emphasis> is to ask
with strong desire and moving appeal. That to <emphasis>beseech</emphasis> is to ask
earnestly as a boon or favor. That to <emphasis>crave</emphasis> is to ask humbly and
abjectly, as though unworthy of receiving. That to <emphasis>implore</emphasis> is to
ask with fervor and intense earnestness. That to <emphasis>supplicate</emphasis> is to
ask with urgent or even desperate appeal. (Both <emphasis>implore</emphasis> and
<emphasis>supplicate</emphasis> imply humility, as of a prayer to a superior being.)
That to <emphasis>importune</emphasis> is to ask for persistently, even wearyingly. That
to <emphasis>petition</emphasis> is to ask a superior, usually in writing, for some
favor, grant, or right.</p>

<p>&lt;Burn, scorch, singe, sear, parch, char, incinerate, cremate,
cauterize.&gt;</p>
<p>If you consume or injure something by bringing it in contact with fire or
heat, you <emphasis>burn</emphasis> it. If you do not consume it but burn it
superficially so as to change the texture or color of its surface, you
<emphasis>scorch</emphasis> it. If you burn off ends or projections of it, you
<emphasis>singe</emphasis> it. If you burn its surface to dryness or hardness, you
<emphasis>sear</emphasis> it. If you dry or shrivel it with heat, you <emphasis>parch</emphasis> it.
If through heat you reduce it to a state of charcoal, or cinders, you
<emphasis>char</emphasis> it. If you burn it to ashes, you <emphasis>incinerate</emphasis> it. (This
word is learned and but little used in ordinary discourse.) If you burn a
dead body to ashes, you <emphasis>cremate</emphasis> it. If you burn or sear anything

<p>&lt;Busy, industrious, diligent, assiduous, sedulous.&gt;</p>
<p>From much of the talk that we hear nowadays it might be supposed that the
earnest devotion of one's self to a task is a thing that has disappeared
from the earth. But a good many people are exhibiting this very devotion.
Let us see in what different degrees. The man who actively applies himself
to something, whether temporarily or habitually, is <emphasis>busy</emphasis>. The man
who makes continued application to work a principle or habit of life, is
<emphasis>industrious</emphasis>. The man who applies himself aggressively to the
accomplishment of some specific undertaking or pursuit, is
<emphasis>diligent</emphasis>. The man who quietly and determinedly sticks to a task
until it is accomplished, no matter what its difficulties or length, is
<emphasis>assiduous</emphasis>. The man who makes steady and painstaking application to
whatever he is about, is <emphasis>sedulous</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: Early in life he acquired ____ habits. By patient and
____ study you may overcome those defects of your early education. "How
doth the ____ little bee improve each shining hour." The manager gave such
____ attention to details that he made few mistakes. He is ____ at
present. Oh, yes, he is always ____. "Nowher so ____ a man has he ther
has, And yet he seemed ____ than he was."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Concise, terse, succinct, compendious, compact, sententious, pithy,
laconic, curt.&gt;</p>
<p>Words descriptive of brief utterance are, in nearly every instance, in
their origin figurative. The brevity is brought out by comparison with
something that is noticeably short or small. Let us examine the words of
our list for their figurative qualities. A <emphasis>concise</emphasis> statement is one
that is <emphasis>cut down</emphasis> until a great deal is said in a few words. A
<emphasis>terse</emphasis> statement is <emphasis>rubbed off</emphasis>, rid of unessentials.
A <emphasis>succinct</emphasis> statement has its important thoughts <emphasis>bound</emphasis> into
small compass, as by a girdle. A <emphasis>compendious</emphasis> statement <emphasis>weighs
together</emphasis> the various thoughts and aspects of a subject; it shows by
means of a few effective words just what these amount to, gives a summary
of them. A <emphasis>compact</emphasis> statement has its units of thought <emphasis>fastened
together</emphasis> into firmness of structure; its brevity is well-knit. A
<emphasis>sententious</emphasis> statement gives <emphasis>feelings</emphasis> or <emphasis>opinions</emphasis> in a
strikingly pointed or axiomatic way, so that they can be easily grasped
and remembered; if <emphasis>sententious</emphasis> is unfavorably used, the statement
may be filled with paraded platitudes. A <emphasis>pithy</emphasis> statement gives the
very <emphasis>pith</emphasis>, the heart of a matter; it is sometimes slightly quaint,
always effective and arresting. A <emphasis>laconic</emphasis> statement is made in the
manner of <emphasis>the Spartans</emphasis>, who hated talk and used as few words as
possible. A <emphasis>curt</emphasis> statement is <emphasis>made short</emphasis>; its abruptness is
oftentimes more or less rude.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: "A tale should be judicious, clear, ____, the language
plain, and incidents well link'd." "Charles Lamb made the most ____
criticism of Spenser when he called him the poet's poet." With a ____,
disdainful answer she turned away. The sermon was filled with ____
sayings. By omitting all irrelevant details, he made his statement of the
case ____. It requires great skill to give a ____ statement of what such a
treatise contains. A proverb is a ____ statement of a truth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Death, decease, demise.&gt;</p>
<p>Men are as mindful of rank and pretension in their terms for the cessation
of life as in their choice of tombstones for the departed. <emphasis>Death</emphasis> is
the great, democratic, unspoilable word. It is not too good for a clown or
too poor for an emperor. <emphasis>Decease</emphasis> is a more formal word. Its
employment is often legal—the death proves to be of sufficient importance
for the law (and the lawyers) to take notice. <emphasis>Demise</emphasis>, however, is
outwardly the most resplendent term of all. It implies that the victim cut
a wide swath even in death. It is used of an illustrious person, as a
king, who transmits his title to an heir. Ordinary people cannot afford a
<emphasis>demise</emphasis>. If the term is applied to their shuffling off of this
mortal coil, the use is euphemistic and likely to be stilted.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: "The crown at the moment of ____ must descend to the
next heir." "____ is a fearful thing." "In their ____ they were not
divided." At the ____ of his father he inherited the estate. "Each shall
take His chamber in the silent halls of ____." "Many a time I have been
half in love with easeful ____."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Early, primitive, primeval, primordial, primal, pristine.&gt;</p>
<p><emphasis>Early</emphasis> is the simple word for that which was in, or toward, the
beginning. That is <emphasis>primitive</emphasis> which has the old-fashioned or simple
qualities characteristic of the beginning. That is <emphasis>primeval</emphasis> which
is of the first or earliest ages. That is <emphasis>primordial</emphasis> which is first
in origin, formation, or development. That is <emphasis>primal</emphasis> which is first
or original. (The word is poetic.) That is <emphasis>pristine</emphasis> which has not
been corrupted from its original state.</p>

murder." "A ____ leaf is that which is immediately developed from the
cotyledon." As the explorers penetrated farther into the country, they
beheld all the ____ beauties of nature. Some countries still use the ____
method of plowing with a stick.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Face, countenance, features, visage, physiognomy.&gt;</p>
<p>We hear some one say that he reads faces. How? Through long study of them
and what they indicate. The human race as a whole has been reading faces
through the centuries. It has felt such need to label certain recurring
aspects of them that it has invented the designating terms. Of these terms
the simple, inclusive one is of course <emphasis>face</emphasis> itself. If, however, we
are thinking of the face as its look or expression reveals thoughts,
emotions, or state of mind, our term is <emphasis>countenance</emphasis>. If we are
thinking of it as distinguished or individualized by the contour, lines,
etc., we speak of the <emphasis>features</emphasis>. If we are thinking of its external
appearance or aspect, we call it the <emphasis>visage</emphasis>. If, finally, we are
thinking of it as indicative of mind, disposition, or fundamental
character, we say <emphasis>physiognomy.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;lineaments&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: His grotesque ____ reminded one of a gargoyle. It is

told the students to wash their ____ every morning. "A ____ more in sorrow
than in anger." The firm but kind ____ of the old statesman shone happily
at this ovation. "For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then ____ to

moulded by one's thoughts. Cosmetics injure the ____. His clear-cut ____
impressed his employer.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Financial, monetary, pecuniary, fiscal.&gt;</p>

or moment. <emphasis>Monetary</emphasis> applies to money, coin, or currency as such.

<p>&lt;Flee, abscond, decamp.&gt;</p>
<p>To <emphasis>flee</emphasis> is to run away from what one would avoid, as danger,
arrest, or the like. To <emphasis>abscond</emphasis> is to steal off secretly and hide
one's self, as from some disgraceful reason or to avoid arrest. To
<emphasis>decamp</emphasis> is to leave suddenly in great haste to get away; the word is
often used humorously.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: They went to have their money refunded, but the swindler
had ____. The bank teller ____ after having squandered most of the
deposits. Yes, we were in proximity to a polecat, and without further
parley we ____. "Resist the devil, and he will ____ from you." William
Wallace, when pursued by the English, ____ into the Highlands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Foretell, predict, prophesy, forecast, presage, forebode, portend,
augur, prognosticate.&gt;</p>
<p><emphasis>Foretell</emphasis> is the general word for stating or perceiving beforehand
that which will happen. <emphasis>Predict</emphasis> implies foretelling based on
well-founded or precise knowledge. <emphasis>Prophesy</emphasis> often implies
supernatural inspiration to foretell correctly. The word is especially so
used in connection with the Scriptures; but in the Scriptures themselves
it frequently expresses insight and admonition without the element of
foretelling. <emphasis>Forecast</emphasis> involves a marked degree of conjecture.
<emphasis>Presage</emphasis> usually means to give as a presentiment or warning.
<emphasis>Forebode</emphasis> expresses an uncertain foreknowledge of vague impending
evil. <emphasis>Portend</emphasis> indicates the likelihood that something will befall
which is threatening or evil in its consequences. <emphasis>Augur</emphasis> means
foretelling from omens. <emphasis>Prognosticate</emphasis> means foretelling through the
study of signs or symptoms.</p>

all? Which term do you think the right one? Bearing in mind the
distinctions we have made, frame sentences of your own to embody the
terms.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Get, acquire, obtain, procure, attain, gain, win, earn.&gt;</p>
<p><emphasis>Get</emphasis>, the general term, may be used of whatever one comes by
whatsoever means to possess, experience, or realize. To <emphasis>acquire</emphasis> is
to get into more or less permanent possession, either by some gradual
process or by one's determined efforts. To <emphasis>obtain</emphasis> is to get
something desired by means of deliberate effort or request. To
<emphasis>procure</emphasis> is to get by definitely planned effort something which, in
most instances, is of a temporary nature or the possession of which is
temporary. To <emphasis>attain</emphasis> is to get through striving that which one has
set as a goal or end of his desire or ambition. To <emphasis>gain</emphasis> is to get
that which is advantageous. To <emphasis>win</emphasis> is to get as the result of
successful competition or the overcoming of opposition. To <emphasis>earn</emphasis> is

or ownership, usually without compensation. We <emphasis>bestow</emphasis> that which we
give gratuitously, or of which the recipient stands in especial need. We
<emphasis>grant</emphasis> that which has been requested by one dependent upon us or
inferior to us, and which we give with some formality. From a position of
superiority we <emphasis>confer</emphasis> as a favor or honor that which we might
withhold or deny. We <emphasis>present</emphasis> that which is of importance or value
and which we give ceremoniously.</p>

<p>&lt;Haste, celerity, speed, hurry, expedition, despatch&gt;.</p>
<p>What did John Wesley mean by saying, "Though I am always in <emphasis>haste</emphasis>,
I am never in a <emphasis>hurry</emphasis>"? Does Lord Chesterfield's saying "Whoever is
in a <emphasis>hurry</emphasis> shows that the thing he is about is too big for him"
help explain the distinction? Explain the distinction (taking <emphasis>speed</emphasis>
in the modern sense) in the saying "The more <emphasis>haste</emphasis>, ever the worse
<emphasis>speed</emphasis>." "The tidings were borne with the usual <emphasis>celerity</emphasis> of
evil news." Give the well-known saying in four simple words that express
the same idea. Which of the two statements is the more forceful? Which is
the more literary? Why did Prescott use the former in his <emphasis>Ferdinand and
Isabella</emphasis>? "<emphasis>Despatch</emphasis>," says Lord Chesterfield, "is the soul of
business." What does <emphasis>despatch</emphasis> suggest about getting work done that
<emphasis>haste</emphasis> or <emphasis>speed</emphasis> does not? In which way would you prefer for
your employee to go about his task—with <emphasis>haste</emphasis>, with <emphasis>speed</emphasis>,
or with <emphasis>despatch</emphasis>? "With wingéd <emphasis>expedition</emphasis>, Swift as the
lightning glance, he executes His errand on the wicked." Why is it that
this use of <emphasis>expedition</emphasis> in Milton's lines is apt? Would
<emphasis>despatch</emphasis> have served as well? If not, why not?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Hate, detest, abhor, loathe, abominate, despise&gt;.</p>
<p>To <emphasis>hate</emphasis> involves deep or passionate dislike, sometimes bred of
ill-will. To <emphasis>detest</emphasis> involves an intense, vehement, or deep-seated
antipathy. To <emphasis>abhor</emphasis> involves utter repugnance or aversion, with an
impulse to recoil. To <emphasis>loathe</emphasis> involves disgust because of physical

<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Healthful, wholesome, salutary, salubrious, sanitary, hygienic&gt;.
(With this group contrast the <emphasis>Disease</emphasis> group below.)</p>
<p>The words of this group are assuredly blessed. Every one of them has to do
with the giving, promotion, or preservation of health. But health is of
various kinds, and therefore the words apply differently. <emphasis>Healthful</emphasis>
is the most inclusive of them; it means that the thing it refers to is
full of health for us. <emphasis>Wholesome</emphasis> also is a very broad term; what is
wholesome is good for us physically, mentally, or morally. <emphasis>Salutary</emphasis>
is confined to that which affects for good our moral (including civic and
social) welfare, especially if it counteracts evil influences or
propensities. <emphasis>Salubrious</emphasis> is confined to the physical; it is used
almost solely of healthful air or climate. <emphasis>Sanitary</emphasis> and
<emphasis>hygienic</emphasis> apply to physical well-being as promoted by the
eradication of the causes for sickness, disease, or the like;
<emphasis>sanitary</emphasis>, however, is used of measures and conditions affecting
people in general, whereas <emphasis>hygienic</emphasis> connects itself with personal
habits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: The word <emphasis>healthy</emphasis> is
often confused with <emphasis>healthful</emphasis>. You have already discriminated
between these two terms, but you should renew your knowledge of the
distinction between them.</p>

<p>&lt;Masculine, male, manly, manlike, manful, mannish, virile&gt;.</p>
<p>"A man's a man for a' that," sang the poet. So he is, but not all the
adjectives allusive to his state are equally complimentary.
<emphasis>Masculine</emphasis> betokens the qualities and characteristics belonging to
men. <emphasis>Male</emphasis> designates sex and is used of animals as well as human
beings. <emphasis>Manly</emphasis> (used of boys as well as men) implies the possession
of qualities worthy of a man, as strength, courage, sincerity, honesty,
independence, or even tenderness. <emphasis>Manlike</emphasis> refers to qualities,
attributes, or foibles characteristically masculine. <emphasis>Manful</emphasis>
suggests the valor, prowess, or resolution properly belonging to men.
<emphasis>Mannish</emphasis> (a derogatory word) indicates superficial or affected
qualities of manhood, especially when inappropriately possessed by a
woman. <emphasis>Virile</emphasis> applies to the sturdy and intrepid qualities of
mature manhood.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Name, appellation, designation, denomination, title, alias&gt;.</p>
<p>A <emphasis>name</emphasis> is the word or words by which a person or thing is called or
known. If the name be descriptive or characterizing, even though in a
fanciful way, it is an <emphasis>appellation</emphasis>. If it particularizes an
individual through reference to distinctive quality or nature, perhaps
without employing any word the individual is usually known by, it is a
<emphasis>designation</emphasis>. If it specifies a class, especially a religious sect
or a kind of coin, it is a <emphasis>denomination</emphasis>. If it is an official or
honorary description of rank, office, place within a profession, or the
like, it is a <emphasis>title</emphasis>. If it is assumed, as to conceal identity, it
is an <emphasis>alias</emphasis>.</p>

<p>&lt;Old, ancient, olden, antique, antiquated, archaic, obsolete, venerable,
immemorial, elderly, aged, hoary, decrepit, senile, superannuated&gt;.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to judge for ourselves when told that something—
especially a joke—is "the very latest." So may we likewise discriminate
among degrees of age. <emphasis>Old</emphasis> is applied to a person or thing that has
existed for a long time or that existed in the distant past. The word may
suggest a familiarity or sentiment not found in <emphasis>ancient</emphasis>, which is
used of that which lived or happened in the remote past, or has come down
from it. <emphasis>Olden</emphasis> applies almost wholly to time long past.
<emphasis>Antique</emphasis> is the term for that which has come down from ancient times
or is made in imitation of the style of ancient times, whereas
<emphasis>antiquated</emphasis> is the term for that which has gone out of style or
fashion. <emphasis>Archaic</emphasis> and <emphasis>obsolete</emphasis> refer to words, customs, or
the like, the former to such as savor of an earlier period though they are
not yet completely out of use, the latter to such as have passed out of
use altogether. <emphasis>Immemorial</emphasis> implies that a thing is so old that it
is beyond the time of memory or record. <emphasis>Elderly</emphasis> is applied to
persons who are between middle age and old age. <emphasis>Aged</emphasis> is used of one
who has lived for an unusually long time. <emphasis>Hoary</emphasis> refers to age as
revealed by white hair. <emphasis>Venerable</emphasis> suggests the reverence to be paid
to the dignity, goodness, or wisdom of old age. <emphasis>Decrepit</emphasis> conveys a
sense of the physical infirmities and weakness which attend old age;
<emphasis>senile</emphasis> of the lessening powers of both body and mind that result
from old age. <emphasis>Superannuated</emphasis> is applied to a person who on account
of old age has been declared incapable of continuing his activities.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: He liked to read romances of the ____ days. Dana records
that he once saw a man so ____ that he had to raise his eyelids with his
fingers. Many writers use ____ words to give quaintness to their work. He
liked to sit around in his ____ clothes. "The moping owl does to the moon
complain Of such as, wandering near her secret bower, Molest her ____
solitary reign." Some of these ____ sequoia trees were old before the
white man discovered this continent. They are building the church in the
____ Roman style of architecture. "Be not … the last to lay the ____
aside." Many of Chaucer's words, being ____, cannot possibly be understood
without a glossary. Most churches now have funds for ____ ministers. A man
is as ____ as he feels; a woman is as ____ as she looks. The ____ old man
could scarcely hobble across the room. What better proof that he is ____
do you ask than that he babbles constantly about what happened when he was

revered the ____ locks of the old hero. At sixty a man is considered a[n]
____ person. That the earth is flat is a[n] ____ idea. The young warriors

<p>&lt;Pay, compensate, recompense, remunerate, requite, reimburse,
indemnify&gt;.</p>
<p>Most men are willing to receive what is due them. They might even be
persuaded to receive a bit more. Why should they not be as scrupulous to
receive what they are entitled to in the medium of language as of money?
Sometimes they are. Offering to <emphasis>pay</emphasis> some people instead of to
<emphasis>compensate</emphasis> them is like offering a tip to the wrong person. Why?
Because there is a social implication in <emphasis>compensate</emphasis> which is not
contained in <emphasis>pay</emphasis>. To <emphasis>pay</emphasis> is simply to give what is due, as
in wages (or even salary), price, or the like. To <emphasis>compensate</emphasis> is to
make suitable return for service rendered. Does <emphasis>compensate</emphasis> not
sound the more soothing? But save in exceptional circumstances the
downrightness of <emphasis>pay</emphasis> has no hint of vulgarity. To <emphasis>recompense</emphasis>
is to make a return, especially if it is not monetary, for work, pains,
trouble, losses, or suffering; or some quality or blessing (as affection
or happiness) may be said to recompense one. To <emphasis>remunerate</emphasis> is to
disburse a large amount to a person, or to give it to him as a reward, or
otherwise to make him a return in a matter of importance. To
<emphasis>requite</emphasis> is to put a just value upon one's work, deeds, or merit and
to make payment strictly in accordance with his deserts. To
<emphasis>reimburse</emphasis> is to make good what some one has spent for you. To
<emphasis>indemnify</emphasis> is to secure some one against loss or to make restitution
for damages he has sustained.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;disburse, reward&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: Let us ____ him for his efforts in our behalf.
Let us ____ their kindness with kindness, their cruelty with cruelty.
To ____ them adequately for such patriotic sacrifices is of course
impossible. The government demanded that it be ____ for the injury to its
citizens. I shall ____ you for all sums expended. He ____ the bill by a
check. The success of her children ____ a mother for her sacrifices for
them. Wages are ____ to laborers; salaries are ____ to judges.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Proud, arrogant, presumptuous, haughty, supercilious, insolent,
insulting&gt;.</p>
<p>Most persons feel in their hearts that their claims and merits are
superior to those of other people. But they do not like for you, in
describing them, to imply that their self-appraisal is too high.
"Comparisons are odious," and therefore in comparing their fancied with
their real selves you must choose your terms carefully. Of the words that
suggest an exaggerated estimate of one's merits or privileges the
broadest, as well as the least offensive, is <emphasis>proud</emphasis>. In fact this
word need not carry the idea of exaggeration. A proud man may but hold
himself in justifiable esteem, or wish to measure up to the demands of his
station or to the expectations of others. On the other hand, he may
overvalue his attainments, possessions, connections, etc. To say that the
man is <emphasis>arrogant</emphasis> means that he combines with pride a contempt for
others, that he claims for himself greater attention, consideration, or
respect than he is entitled to. To say that he is <emphasis>presumptuous</emphasis>
makes him an inferior (or at least not a superior) who claims privileges
or takes liberties improperly. To say that he is <emphasis>haughty</emphasis> means that
he assumes a disdainful superiority to others, especially through fancied
or actual advantage over them in birth or social position. To say that he
is <emphasis>supercilious</emphasis> means that he maintains toward others an attitude
of lofty indifference or sneering contempt. To say that he is
<emphasis>insolent</emphasis> means that he is purposely and perhaps coarsely
disrespectful toward others, especially toward his superiors. To say that
he is <emphasis>insulting</emphasis> means that he gives or offers personal affront,
probably in scornful or disdainful speech.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;scornful, imperious,
contumelious, impudent, impertinent&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: He was ____ in replying to the questions. She paid no
attention to his words, but kept looking at him with a[n] ____ smile. He
was ____ in acting as if he were their equal. The hot-tempered fellow
answered this ____ remark with a blow. She resented his presuming to speak
to her, and turned away in a[n] ____ manner. The servant was ____ to her
mistress. Are you not very ____ of your family connections? The old man
was so ____ that he expected people to raise their hats to him and not to
sit down till he gave permission.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Punish, chastise, chasten&gt;.</p>
<p>To <emphasis>punish</emphasis> a person is to inflict pain or penalty upon him as a
retribution for wrong-doing. There may be, usually is, no intention to
improve the offender. To <emphasis>chastise</emphasis> him is to inflict deserved
corporal punishment upon him for corrective purposes. To <emphasis>chasten</emphasis>
him is to afflict him with trouble for his reformation or spiritual
betterment. The word is normally employed in connection with such
affliction from God.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;castigate, scourge&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: "Hearing oftentimes The still, sad music of humanity,
Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power To ____ and subdue." Ichabod
Crane freely used his ferule in ____ his pupils. "Whom the Lord loveth he
____." A naughty child should be ____.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Rich, wealthy, affluent, opulent&gt;.</p>
<p>"It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a
rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." Substitute <emphasis>wealthy</emphasis> for
<emphasis>rich</emphasis>. Is the meaning exactly the same? Is Goldsmith's description
of the village preacher—"passing rich with forty pounds a year"—as
effective if <emphasis>wealthy</emphasis> is substituted? What is the difference between
<emphasis>riches</emphasis> and <emphasis>wealth</emphasis>? Which implies the greater degree of
possession, which the more permanence and stability? Which word suggests
the more personal relationship with money? Which word the more definitely
denotes money or its immediate equivalent? Why do we say "get-rich-quick
schemes" rather than "get-wealthy-quick schemes"? What besides the
possession of wealth does <emphasis>affluent</emphasis> suggest? Could we say that a
rich miser lives in affluence? If not, why not? A poor clerk who has ten
dollars to spend as he pleases may feel affluent. A rich banker may be a
man of affluence in his town. What power does this suggest that he has
besides the possession of a great deal of money? Explain all that Swift
implies by the word <emphasis>opulence</emphasis> in the quotation "There in full
opulence a banker dwelt, Who all the joys and pangs of riches felt." If
you substitute <emphasis>affluence</emphasis>, what different impression do you get?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Rural, rustic, pastoral, bucolic&gt;.</p>
<p>"The <emphasis>rural</emphasis> inhabitants of a country." Are the people being spoken
of favorably, unfavorably, or neutrally? How would the meaning be affected
if they were called <emphasis>rustic</emphasis> inhabitants? Would you ordinarily speak
of the <emphasis>rural</emphasis> or the <emphasis>rustic</emphasis> population to distinguish it from
the urban? Would you speak of <emphasis>rural</emphasis> or <emphasis>rustic</emphasis> activities?
<emphasis>rural</emphasis> or <emphasis>rustic</emphasis> manners? When the two adjectives may be
employed, is one of them unflattering? Is a <emphasis>rustic</emphasis> bridge something
to be ashamed of? a <emphasis>rustic</emphasis> chair? a <emphasis>rustic</emphasis> gate? What, then,
is the degree of reproach that attaches to each of the two adjectives? the
degree of commendation? Wherein do <emphasis>pastoral</emphasis> scenes differ from
<emphasis>rural</emphasis>? <emphasis>pastoral</emphasis> amusements from <emphasis>rustic</emphasis>? Can you trace
a connection between the <emphasis>pastor</emphasis> of a church and a <emphasis>pastoral</emphasis>
life? Do you often hear the word <emphasis>bucolic</emphasis>? In what mood is it
oftenest uttered? Which of the four adjectives best fits into Goldsmith's
dignified lament: "And ____ mirth and manners are no more"?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Silent, reserved, uncommunicative, reticent, taciturn&gt;.
(This group may be contrasted with the <emphasis>Talkative</emphasis> group, below.)</p>
<p>We pass through a crowded room and notice that some of its occupants are
not adding their voices to the chatter. We resolve to study these
unspeaking persons. Some of them merely have nothing to say, or are timid
or preoccupied; or it may be they deliberately have set themselves not to
talk. These are <emphasis>silent</emphasis>. Some plainly desire not to talk, it may be
in general or it may be upon some particular topic; they may (but need
not) regard themselves as superior to their associates, or for some other
reason let aloofness or coldness creep into their manner. These are
<emphasis>reserved</emphasis>. Others withhold information that persons about them are,
or would be, interested in. These are <emphasis>uncommunicative</emphasis>. Others
maintain their own counsel; they neglect opportunities to reveal their
thoughts, plans, and the like. These are <emphasis>reticent</emphasis>. Others are
disinclined—and habitually, we perceive—to talking. These are
<emphasis>taciturn</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: The ____ prisoner evaded all questions. He was as ____
as nature itself; he never gave his views upon any subject. He was ____
about the firm's affairs, especially toward persons who seemed
inquisitive. We knew there had been a love affair in his life, but he was
____ on the subject. She sat ____ throughout the discussion. If to be ____
is golden, Lucas should have been a billionaire.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Sing, chant, carol, warble, troll, yodel, croon, hum, chirp,
chirrup&gt;.</p>
<p>You hear a "concord of sweet sounds," not instrumental but vocal, and wish
to tell me so. You say that some person <emphasis>sings</emphasis>. Then you recall that
I am something of an expert in music, and you cast about for the word that
shall state specifically the kind of singing that is being done. Does the
person sing solemnly in a more or less uniform tone? You tell me that he
<emphasis>chants</emphasis>. Does he sing gladly, spontaneously, high-spiritedly, as if
his heart were pouring over with joy? You say that he <emphasis>carols</emphasis>. Does
he sing with vibratory notes and little runs, as in bird-music? You say
that he <emphasis>warbles</emphasis>. Does he sing loudly and freely? You say that he
<emphasis>trolls</emphasis>. Does he sing with peculiar modulations from the regular
into a falsetto voice? You say that he <emphasis>yodels</emphasis>. Does he sing a
simple, perhaps tender, song in a low tone (as a lullaby to an infant)?
You say that he <emphasis>croons</emphasis>. Does he sing with his lips closed? You say
that he <emphasis>hums</emphasis>. Does he utter the short, perhaps sharp, notes of
certain birds and insects? You say that he <emphasis>chirps</emphasis> or
<emphasis>chirrups</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;trill, pipe, quaver,
peep, cheep, twitter&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: A cricket ____ in the grass outside the door. He
abstractedly gazed out of the window and ____ a few strains of an old
song. Listen, they are ____ the Te Deum. "And ____ still dost soar, and
soaring ever ____." A strange, uncanny blending of false and true notes it
is when the Swiss mountaineers are ____. Negroes, as a race, love to
____. As she soothes the child to sleep she ____ a "rock-a-bye-baby."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Suave, bland, unctuous, fulsome, smug&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suave</emphasis> implies agreeable persuasiveness or smooth urbanity.
<emphasis>Bland</emphasis> suggests a soothing or coaxing kindness of manner, one that
is sometimes lacking in sincerity. <emphasis>Unctuous</emphasis> implies excessive
smoothness, as though one's manner were oiled. The word carries a decided
suggestion of hypocrisy. <emphasis>Fulsome</emphasis> suggests such gross flattery as to
be annoying or cloying. <emphasis>Smug</emphasis> suggests an effeminate
self-satisfaction, usually not justified by merit or achievement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;complaisant, elegant,
trim, dapper, spruce, genteel, urbane, well-bred, gracious, affable,
benign&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: He thought his answer exceedingly brilliant and settled

wrinkling wind On glassy water drove his cheek in lines." They were
irritated by his ____ praise. Although he disliked them, he greeted them

____ upon the mart; let him look to his bond." ____ as a diplomat.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Talkative, loquacious, garrulous, fluent, voluble, glib&gt;.
(This group may be contrasted with the <emphasis>Silent</emphasis> group, above.)</p>
<p>A little while ago you were in a crowded room and made a study of the
persons disposed to silence. But your study was carried on under
difficulties, for many of those about you showed a tendency to copious or
excessive speech. One woman entered readily into conversation with you and
convinced you that her natural disposition was to converse a great deal.
She was <emphasis>talkative</emphasis>. From her you escaped to a man who soon proved
that he talked too much and could run on with an incessant flow of words,
perhaps employing many of them where a few would have sufficed. He was
<emphasis>loquacious</emphasis>. The two of you were joined by an old gentleman who
forthwith began to talk wordily, tediously, continuously, with needless
repetitions and in tiresome detail; you suspected that he had suffered a
mental decline from age, and that he might be excessively fond, in season
and out of season, of talking about himself and his opinions. He was
<emphasis>garrulous</emphasis>. You broke away from these two and fell into the hands of
a much more agreeable interlocutor. He talked with a ready, easy command
of words, so that his discourse <emphasis>flowed</emphasis> smoothly. He was
<emphasis>fluent</emphasis>. He introduced you to a lady whose speech possessed
smoothness and ease in too great degree; it fairly <emphasis>rolled</emphasis> along, as
a hoop does downhill. The lady was <emphasis>voluble</emphasis>. Into your triangular
group broke a newcomer whose speech had in it a flippant, or at least a
superficially clever, fluency. He was <emphasis>glib</emphasis>. Leaving these three to
fight (or talk) it out as best they might, you grabbed your hat and
hurried outside for a fresh whiff of air.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;chattering, long-winded,

____ that I spent half the afternoon with her and learned nothing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Weak, debilitated, feeble, infirm, decrepit, impotent&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Weak</emphasis> is the general word for that which is deficient in strength.
<emphasis>Debilitated</emphasis> is used of physical weakness, in most instances brought
on by excesses and abuses. <emphasis>Feeble</emphasis> denotes decided or extreme
weakness, which may excite pity or contempt. <emphasis>Infirm</emphasis> is applied to a
person whose weakness or feebleness is due to age. <emphasis>Decrepit</emphasis> is used
in reference to a person broken down or worn out by infirmities, age, or
sickness. <emphasis>Impotent</emphasis> implies such loss or lack of strength or
vitality as to render ineffective or helpless.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Assignment for further discrimination</emphasis>: &lt;enervated, languid,
frail&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: "Here I stand, your slave, A poor, ____, weak, and
despis'd old man." A[n] ____ old man shuffled along with the aid of a

his hand. "Like rich hangings in a homely house, So was his will in his
old ____ body." After his long illness he was as ____ as a child. He made
but a[n] ____ attempt to defend himself.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Wise, learned, erudite, sagacious, sapient, sage, judicious, prudent,
provident, discreet&gt;. (Compare the distinction between <emphasis>knowledge</emphasis>
and <emphasis>wisdom</emphasis> under Words Often Confused above.)</p>
<p><emphasis>Wise</emphasis> implies sound and discriminating judgment, resulting from
either learning or experience. <emphasis>Learned</emphasis> denotes the past acquisition
of much information through study. <emphasis>Erudite</emphasis> means characterized by
extensive or profound knowledge. <emphasis>Sagacious</emphasis> implies far-sighted
judgment and intuitive discernment, especially in practical matters.
<emphasis>Sapient</emphasis> is now of infrequent use except as applied ironically or
playfully to one having or professing wisdom. <emphasis>Sage</emphasis> implies deep
wisdom that comes from age or experience. <emphasis>Judicious</emphasis> denotes sound
judgment or careful discretion in weighing a matter with reference to its
merits or its consequences. <emphasis>Prudent</emphasis> conveys a sense of cautious
foresight in judging the future and planning for it upon the basis of the
circumstances at hand. <emphasis>Provident</emphasis> suggests practical foresight and
careful economy in preparing for future needs. <emphasis>Discreet</emphasis> denotes
care or painstakingness in doing or saying the right thing at the right
time, and the avoidance thereby of errors or unpleasant results.</p>

college he had been ____. "Most ____ judge!" The ____ old warrior could

lavishly? He considered the matter well and gave a most ____ answer. To
spend every cent of one's income is surely not to be ____.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Work, labor, toil, drudgery&gt;.</p>
<p>All of us, at times anyhow, get out of as much work as we can. We even use
the word <emphasis>work</emphasis> and its synonyms loosely and indolently. Perhaps this
is a literary aspect of the labor problem. If, however, we can shake off
our sluggishness and exert ourselves in discriminating our terms, we shall
use <emphasis>work</emphasis> as a general word for effort, physical or mental, to some
purposive end; <emphasis>labor</emphasis> for hard, physical work; <emphasis>toil</emphasis> for
wearying or exhaustive work; and <emphasis>drudgery</emphasis> for tedious, monotonous,
or distasteful work, especially of a low or menial kind.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sentences</emphasis>: It required the ____ of thousands of men to complete the
tunnel. To be condemned to the galleys meant a life of unending ____. The

<p><strong>    SYNONYMS IN LARGER GROUPS (2)</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You have now seen enough of the method of discriminating synonyms to take
more of the responsibility for such work upon yourself. In this chapter,
therefore, the plan followed in Exercise A is abandoned and no
discriminations are supplied you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>EXERCISE B</strong></p>
<p>For some of the generic words in Exercise A you will find antonyms in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Exercise C. Here is a list:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In Exercise A: walk, laugh, busy, hate, masculine, old</p>
<p>In Exercise C: run, cry, idle, love, feminine, young.</p>
<p>Now each of the generic terms in C is followed by a list of its synonyms.
But for the six generic terms just given let us see how many synonyms you
can find for yourself. Simply study each word in turn, think of all the
synonyms for it you can summon, strike out those you consider far-fetched.
Then compare your list with the list under the antonym in Exercise A; if
possible, improve your list by means of this comparison. Finally, compare
your revised list with the list in Exercise C.</p>
<p>In Exercise C are two generic terms that carry the same idea (but not in
the same part of speech) as generic terms in Exercise A. They are as
follows:</p>
<p>In Exercise A: sing, death</p>
<p>In Exercise C: song, die.</p>
<p>Take <emphasis>song</emphasis> and <emphasis>die</emphasis>. First, find all the satisfactory synonyms
you can for yourself. Then if possible improve your list by studying the
list under the corresponding word in Exercise A. Finally, compare your
revised list with the one in Exercise C.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>EXERCISE C</strong></p>
<p>After three introductory groups (dealing with thoroughly concrete ideas
and words) the synonyms in this exercise are arranged alphabetically
according to the first word in each group.</p>
<p>Discriminate the words in each group, and fill each blank in the
illustrative sentences with the word that conveys the meaning exactly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;See, perceive, descry, distinguish, espy, discern, note, notice, watch,

<empty-line/>
<p>

  Put <emphasis>rancors</emphasis> in the vessel of my peace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Only for them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Her <emphasis>resentment</emphasis> against the king seems not to have abated.</p>
<p>Mrs. W. was in high <emphasis>dudgeon</emphasis>; her heels clattered on the red-tiled
floor, and she whisked about the house like a parched pea upon a
drum-head.</p>
<p>  If I can catch him once upon the hip,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  I will feed fat the ancient <emphasis>grudge</emphasis> I bear him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Men of this character pursue a <emphasis>grudge</emphasis> unceasingly, and never forget
or forgive.</p>
<p>  And since you ne'er provoked their <emphasis>spite</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Depend upon't their judgment's right.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Marriage, matrimony, wedlock&gt;. (With this group compare the
<emphasis>matrimonial</emphasis> group in Exercise C, above.)</p>
<p><emphasis>Marriages</emphasis> are made in heaven.</p>
<p>Hasty <emphasis>marriage</emphasis> seldom proveth well.</p>
<p>A man finds himself seven years older the day after his <emphasis>marriage</emphasis>.</p>
<p>  Let me not to the <emphasis>marriage</emphasis> of true minds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Admit impediments.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Marriage</emphasis> is the best state for man in general; and every man is a
worse man in proportion as he is unfit for the married state.</p>
<p><emphasis>Matrimony</emphasis>—the high sea for which no compass has yet been invented.</p>
<p><emphasis>Wedlock's</emphasis> a lane where there is no turning.</p>
<p>  What is <emphasis>wedlock</emphasis> forced, but a hell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  An age of discord and continual strife?</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Mercy, clemency, lenity, leniency, lenience, forbearance&gt;.</p>
<p>  Teach me to feel another's woe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  To hide the fault I see;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  That <emphasis>mercy</emphasis> I to others show,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  That <emphasis>mercy</emphasis> show to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>  The quality of <emphasis>mercy</emphasis> is not strain'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  It blesseth him that gives and him that takes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

       *       *       *       *       *</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And earthly power doth then show likest God's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  When <emphasis>mercy</emphasis> seasons justice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Clemency</emphasis> is the surest proof of a true monarch.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lenity</emphasis> will operate with greater force, in some instances, than
vigor.</p>
<p>All the fellows tried to persuade the Master to greater <emphasis>leniency</emphasis>,
but in vain.</p>
<p>It will be necessary that this acceptance should be followed up by
measures of the utmost <emphasis>lenience</emphasis>.</p>
<p>There is however a limit at which <emphasis>forbearance</emphasis> ceases to be a
virtue.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Pity, sympathy, compassion, commiseration, condolence&gt;.</p>
<p>  Careless their merits or their faults to scan,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  His <emphasis>pity</emphasis> gave ere charity began.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>For <emphasis>pity</emphasis> melts the mind to love.</p>
<p>For <emphasis>pitee</emphasis> renneth [runneth] soon in gentle herte [heart].</p>
<p>Our <emphasis>sympathy</emphasis> is cold to the relation of distant misery.</p>
<p>Man may dismiss <emphasis>compassion</emphasis> from his heart, but God will never.</p>
<p>It is unworthy a religious man to view an irreligious one either with
alarm or aversion; or with any other feeling than regret, and hope, and
brotherly <emphasis>commiseration</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Their congratulations and their <emphasis>condolences</emphasis> are equally words of
course.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Poverty, want, need, destitution, indigence, penury&gt;.</p>
<p>  Is there for honest <emphasis>poverty</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  That hings [hangs] his head, and a' that?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Not to be able to bear <emphasis>poverty</emphasis> is a shameful thing, but not to know
how to chase it away by work is a more shameful thing yet.</p>
<p>  Stitch! stitch! stitch!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  In <emphasis>poverty</emphasis>, hunger, and dirt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And still with a voice of dolorous pitch,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Would that its tone could reach the Rich,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  She sang this "Song of the Shirt!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Poverty</emphasis> is dishonorable, not in itself, but when it is a proof of
laziness, intemperance, luxury, and carelessness; whereas in a person that
is temperate, industrious, just and valiant, and who uses all his virtues
for the public good, it shows a great and lofty mind.</p>
<p>  <emphasis>Want</emphasis> is a bitter and hateful good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Because its virtues are not understood;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Yet many things, impossible to thought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Have been by <emphasis>need</emphasis> to full perfection brought.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Hundreds would never have known <emphasis>want</emphasis> if they had not first known
waste.</p>
<p>  O! reason not the <emphasis>need</emphasis>; our basest beggars</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Are in the poorest thing superfluous:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Allow not nature more than nature needs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Man's life is cheap as beast's.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The Christian inhabitants of Thessaly would be reduced to
<emphasis>destitution</emphasis>.</p>
<p>It is the care of a very great part of mankind to conceal their
<emphasis>indigence</emphasis> from the rest.</p>
<p>  Chill <emphasis>penury</emphasis> repress'd their noble rage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And froze the genial current of the soul.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Chill <emphasis>penury</emphasis> weighs down the heart itself; and though it sometimes
be endured with calmness, it is but the calmness of despair.</p>
<p>  Where <emphasis>penury</emphasis> is felt the thought is chain'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And sweet colloquial pleasures are but few.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Regret, compunction, remorse, contrition, penitence, repentance&gt;.</p>
<p><emphasis>Regrets</emphasis> over the past should chasten the future.</p>
<p>He acknowledged his disloyalty to the king with expressions of great
<emphasis>compunction</emphasis>.</p>
<p>  Through no disturbance of my soul,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Or strong <emphasis>compunction</emphasis> in me wrought,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  I supplicate for thy control.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>God speaks to our hearts through the voice of <emphasis>remorse</emphasis>.</p>
<p>To err is human; but <emphasis>contrition</emphasis> felt for the crime distinguishes
the virtuous from the wicked.</p>
<p>Christian <emphasis>penitence</emphasis> is something more than a thought or an emotion
or a tear; it is action.</p>
<p><emphasis>Repentance</emphasis> must be something more than mere <emphasis>remorse</emphasis> for
sins; it comprehends a change of nature befitting heaven.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>&lt;Stubborn, obstinate, pertinacious, intractable, refractory,
contumacious&gt;.</p>
<p>  For fools are <emphasis>stubborn</emphasis> in their way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  As coins are harden'd by th' allay;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  And <emphasis>obstinacy's</emphasis> ne'er so stiff</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  As when 'tis in a wrong belief.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>They may also laugh at their <emphasis>pertinacious</emphasis> and incurable obstinacy.</p>
<p>He who is <emphasis>intractable</emphasis>, he whom nothing can persuade, may boast
himself invincible.</p>
<p>  There is a law in each well-order'd nation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  To curb those raging appetites that are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

  Most disobedient and <emphasis>refractory</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>He then dissolved Parliament, and sent its most <emphasis>refractory</emphasis> members
to the Tower.</p>
<p>If he were <emphasis>contumacious</emphasis>, he might be excommunicated, or, in other
words, be deprived of all civil rights and imprisoned for life.</p>

<p>IX</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>    MANY-SIDED WORDS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In Chapter VII you made a study of printed distinctions between synonyms.
In Chapter VIII you were given lists of synonyms and made the distinctions
yourself. Near the close of Chapter VIII you were given words and
discovered for yourself what their synonyms are. This third stage might
seem to reveal to you the full joys and benefits of your researches in
this subject. Certainly to find a new word for an old one is an
exhilarating sort of mental travel. And to find a new word which expresses
exactly what an old one expressed but approximately is a real acquisition
in living. But you are not yet a perfectly trained hunter of synonyms.
Some miscellaneous tasks remain; they will involve hard work and call your
utmost powers into play.</p>
<p>Of these tasks the most important is connected with the hint already given
that many words, especially if they be generic words, have two or more
entirely different meanings. Let us first establish this fact, and
afterwards see what bearing it has on our study of synonyms.</p>
<p>My friend says, "I hope you will have a good day." Does he mean an
enjoyable one in general? a profitable or lucrative one, in case I have
business in hand? a successful one, if I am selling stocks or buying a
house? Possibly he means a sunshiny day if I intend to play golf, a snowy
day if I plan to go hunting, a rainy day if my crops are drying up. The
ideas here are varied, even contradictory, enough; yet <emphasis>good</emphasis> may be
used of every one of them. <emphasis>Good</emphasis> is in truth so general a term that
we must know the attendant circumstances if we are to attach to it a
signification even approximately accurate. This does not at all imply that
<emphasis>good</emphasis> is a term we may brand as useless. It implies merely that when
our meaning is specific we must set <emphasis>good</emphasis> aside (unless
circumstances make its sense unmistakable) in favor of a specific word.</p>
<p><emphasis>Things</emphasis> is another very general term. In "Let us wash up the things"
it likely means dishes or clothes. In "Hang your things in the closet" it
likely means clothes. In "Put the things in the tool-box" it likely means
tools. In "Put the things in the sewing-basket" it likely means thread,
needles, and scissors. In "The trenches are swarming with these things" it
likely means cooties. A more accurate word is usually desirable. Yet we
may see the value of the generality in the saying "A place for everything,
and everything in its place."</p>
<p><emphasis>Good</emphasis> and <emphasis>things</emphasis> are not alone in having multitudinous
meanings. There are in the language numerous many-sided words. These words
should be studied carefully. True, they are not always employed in
ambiguous ways. For example, <emphasis>right</emphasis> in the sense of correct is
seldom likely to be mistaken for <emphasis>right</emphasis> in the sense of not-left,
but a reader or hearer may frequently mistake it for <emphasis>right</emphasis> in the
sense of just or of honorable. In the use of such words, therefore, we
cannot become too discriminating.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>EXERCISE H</strong></p>
<p>This exercise concerns itself with common words that have more than one
meaning. Make your procedure as follows. First, look up the word itself.
Under it you will find a number of defining words. Then look up each of
these in turn, until you have the requisite number and kind of synonyms.
(The word is sure to have more synonyms than are called for.) You will
have to use your dictionary tirelessly.</p>
<p>&lt;Bare.&gt; Find three synonyms for <emphasis>bare</emphasis> as applied to the body;
three for it as applied to a room.</p>
<p>&lt;Bear.&gt; Give three other words that might be used instead of
<emphasis>bear</emphasis> in the sentence "The pillar bears a heavy weight"; three in
the sentence "He bore a heavy load on his back"; three in the sentence "He
bore the punishment that was unjustly meted out to him"; three in the
sentence "He bore a grudge against his neighbor"; two in the sentence "The
field did not bear a crop last year."</p>
<p>&lt;Bold.&gt; Give ten synonyms for <emphasis>bold</emphasis> as applied to a warrior;
ten as applied to a young girl. Observe that the synonyms in the first
list are favorable in import and suggest the idea of bravery, whereas
those in the second list are unfavorable and suggest the idea of
brazenness. How do you account for this fact? Can you think of
circumstances in which a young girl might be so placed that the favorable
synonyms might be applied to her?</p>
<p>&lt;Bright.&gt; Give as many words as you can, at least twelve, that can be
used instead of <emphasis>bright</emphasis> as applied to a light, a diamond, a wet
pavement, or a live coal. Give three words for <emphasis>bright</emphasis> as applied to
a child of unusual intelligence; two as applied to an occasion that
promises to turn out well; two as applied to a career that has been
signally successful.</p>
<p>&lt;Clear.&gt; Give five synonyms for clear as applied to water; ten as
applied to a fact or a statement; three as applied to the sky or
atmosphere; three as applied to the voice; two as applied to a passageway
or a view; three as applied to one's judgment or thinking.</p>
<p>&lt;Close.&gt; Give three words that could be substituted for <emphasis>close</emphasis>
as applied to the atmosphere in a room; four as applied to a person who is
uninclined to talk about a matter; three as applied to something not far
off; four as applied to a friend; five as applied to a person who is
reluctant to spend money; five as applied to a translation; five as
applied to attention or endeavor.</p>
<p>&lt;Discharge.&gt; Substitute in turn four words for <emphasis>discharge</emphasis> in
the sentence "The judge discharged the prisoner"; two in the sentence "The
foreman discharged the workman"; two in the sentence "The hunter
discharged the gun"; three in the sentence "The sore discharged pus"; two
in the sentence "My neighbor discharged the debt"; two in the sentence "He
discharged his duty."</p>
<p>&lt;Dull&gt;. Name three words besides <emphasis>dull</emphasis> that could be applied to
a blade or a point; five to a person with slow intellect; three to
indifference toward others; two to a color; three to a day that is not
cheerful; five to talk or discourse that is not interesting.</p>
<p>&lt;Fair&gt;. Substitute five words for <emphasis>fair</emphasis> in the sentence "He
gave a fair judgment in the case"; three in the sentence "The son made a
fair showing in his studies"; four in the sentence "She had a fair face";
two in the sentence "Her complexion was fair"; three in the sentence "Let
no shame ever fall upon your fair name."</p>
<p>&lt;False&gt;. Find two words that you can substitute for <emphasis>false</emphasis> as
applied to a signature, to a report or a piece of news, to jewels or
money, to a friend.</p>
<p>&lt;Fast&gt;. Name two words I might substitute for <emphasis>fast</emphasis> in the
sentence "Drive the stake until it is fast in the ground"; three in the
sentence "He made a fast trip for the doctor"; six in the sentence "By
leading a fast life he soon squandered his inheritance."</p>
<p>&lt;Firm&gt;. Substitute four words for <emphasis>firm</emphasis> in the sentence "I made
the board firm by nailing it to the wall"; three in the sentence "The
water froze into a firm mass"; five in the sentence "He was firm in his
determination to proceed."</p>
<p>&lt;Flat&gt;. Instead of <emphasis>flat</emphasis> use in turn four other words in the
sentence "This is a flat piece of ground"; five in the sentence "It was as
flat a story as ever wearied company"; three in the sentence "The cook
having forgotten the salt, the soup was flat"; four in the sentence "I am
surprised by your flat refusal."</p>

with the words, and must find the ideas and objects.</p>
<p>&lt;Base&gt;. To what is <emphasis>base</emphasis> applied when inferior, cheap,
worthless could be used as its synonyms? To what is it applied when
debased, impure, spurious, alloyed, counterfeit could be used? When mean,
despicable, contemptible, shameful, disgraceful, dishonorable,
discreditable, scandalous, infamous, villainous, low-minded could be used?
When ignoble, servile, slavish, groveling, menial could be used? When
plebeian, obscure, untitled, vulgar, lowly, nameless, humble, unknown
could be used?</p>
<p>&lt;Mortal&gt;. Can you properly contrast mortal with immortal existence?

<p>Reread the discussion of <emphasis>good</emphasis> and <emphasis>things</emphasis> in Many-sided
Words. Then for each of the words listed below collect or compose twenty
or more sentences in which the word is used. As largely as possible, take
them from actual experience. In doing this you must listen to the use of
the word in everyday talk. After you have made your list of sentences as
varied and extensive as you can, try to substitute synonyms that will
express the idea more accurately. Note whether a knowledge of the
attendant circumstances is necessary to an understanding of the original

book of synonyms for the further extension of your lists.</p>
<p>(By way of illustration, let us take the word <emphasis>quiet</emphasis>. Through
meditation and analysis we discover that it may be applied (a) to water or

demonstrative or forward in manner. We then think of all the words we can

incompletely or unsatisfactorily we feel we are performing this task, we
must not give it over until we have found every word we can summon. Then
we turn to a dictionary or book of synonyms. Thus for <emphasis>quiet</emphasis> we
shall assemble such synonyms as (a) calm, still, motionless, placid,
tranquil, serene, smooth, unruffled, undisturbed, pacific, stagnant;
(b) silent, still, noiseless, mute, hushed, voiceless; (c) secluded,
sequestered, solitary, isolated, unfrequented, unvisited, peaceful,

<p>&lt;Literal vs. Figurative Applications&gt;</p>
<p>One of the most interesting things to watch in the study of words is their
development from a literal to a figurative application. The first man who
broke away from the confines of the literal meaning of a word and applied
the word to something that only in a figurative sense had qualities
analogous to the original meaning, was creating poetry. He was making an
imaginative flight comparable in daring to the Wright brothers' first
aeronautic flight. But as the word was used over and over in this
figurative way the imaginative flight became more and more commonplace. At
last it ceased to be imaginative at all; through frequent repetition it
had settled into the matter of course. A glance back at the <emphasis>Concise</emphasis>
group above will show you that with time the comparison which was once the
basis and the life of the figurative use of words is dulled, obscured,
even lost.</p>
<p>As a further enforcement of this fact, let us analyze the word
<emphasis>rough</emphasis>. In its literal application, it may designate any surface
that has ridges, projections, or inequalities and is therefore uneven,
jagged, rugged, scraggy, or scabrous. Now frequently a man's face or head
is rough because unshaved or uncombed; also the fur of an animal is rough.
Hence the term could be used for unkempt, disheveled, shaggy, hairy,
coarse, bristly. "The child ran its hand over its father's rough cheek"
and "The bear had a rough coat" are sentences that even the most
unimaginative mind can understand. We speak of rough timber because its
surface has not been planed or made smooth. We speak of a rough diamond
because it is unpolished, uncut. Note that all these uses are literal,
that in each instance some unevenness of surface is referred to.</p>
<p>But man, urged on by the desire to say what he means with more novelty,
strikingness, or force, applied the word to ideas that have no surfaces to
be uneven. He imagined what these ideas would be like if they had
surfaces. Of course in putting these conceptions into language he was
creating figures of speech, some of them startlingly apt, some of them
merely far-fetched. He said a man had a <emphasis>rough</emphasis> voice, as though the
voice were like a cactus in its prickly irregularities. By <emphasis>rough</emphasis> he
meant what his fellows meant when they spoke of the voice as harsh,
grating, jarring, discordant, inharmonious, strident, raucous, or
unmusical. Going farther, that early poet said the weather was
<emphasis>rough</emphasis>. He thought of clement weather as being smooth and even, but
of inclement, severe, stormy, tempestuous, or violent weather as being
full of projections to rend and harass one. Thus an everyday use of the
term today was once wrenched and immoderate speech. Possibly the first man
who heard of rough weather was puzzled for a moment, then amused or
delighted as he caught the figure. It did not require great originality to
think of a crowd as <emphasis>rough</emphasis> in its movements. But our poet applied
the idea to an individual. To him a rude, uncivil, impolite, ungracious,
uncourteous, unpolished, uncouth, boorish, blunt, bluff, gruff, brusk, or
burly person was as the unplaned lumber or the unpolished gem; and we
imitative moderns still call such a man <emphasis>rough</emphasis>. But we do not think
of the man as covered with projections that need to be taken off, unless
forsooth we receive <emphasis>rough</emphasis> treatment at his hands. And note how far
we have journeyed from the original idea of the word when we say "I gave
the report a <emphasis>rough</emphasis> glance," meaning cursory, hasty, superficial, or
incomplete consideration.</p>
<p>Many very simple words, including several of those already treated in this
chapter, are two-sided in that they are both literal and figurative.</p>

<p>&lt;Imperfectly Understood Facts and Ideas&gt;</p>
<p>Thus far in this chapter we have been considering many-sided words. We
must now turn to a certain class of facts and ideas that deserve better
understanding and closer analysis than we usually accord them.</p>
<p>These facts and ideas are supposed to be matters of common knowledge. And
in their broad scope and purport they are. Because acquaintance with them
is taken for granted it behooves us to know them. Yet they are in reality
complicated, and when we attempt to deal with them in detail, our
assurance forsakes us. All of us have our "blind sides" intellectually—
quake to have certain areas of discussion entered, because we foresee that
we must sit idly by without power to make sensible comment. Unto as many
as possible of these blind sides of ourselves we should pronounce the
blessed words, "Let there be light." We have therefore to consider certain
matters and topics which are supposed to belong to the common currency of
social information, but with which our familiarity is less thoroughgoing
than it should be.</p>
<p>What are these facts and topics? Take for illustration the subject of
aeronautics. Suppose we have but the vaguest conception of the part played
or likely to be played by aircraft in war, commerce, and pleasure. Suppose
we are not aware that some craft are made to float and others to be driven
by propellers. Suppose such terms as Zeppelin, blimp, monoplane, biplane,
hydroplane, dirigible have no definite import for us. Does not our
knowledge fall short of that expected of well-informed men in this present
age?</p>
<p>Or take military terms. Everybody uses them—clergymen, pacifists,
clubmen, social reformers, novelists, tramps, brick-layers, Big-Stickers.
We cannot escape them if we would. We ourselves use them. But do we use
them with precise and masterly understanding? You call one civilian
colonel and another major; which have you paid the higher compliment? You
are uncertain whether a given officer is a colonel or a major, and you
wish to address him in such fashion as will least offend his sensitiveness
as to rank and nomenclature; which title—colonel or major—is the less
perilous? You are told that a major has command of a battalion; does that
tell you anything about him? You are told that he has command of a
squadron, of a brigade, of a platoon; do these changes in circumstances
have any import for you? If not, you have too faltering a grasp upon
military facts and terminology.</p>
<p>The best remedy for such shortcomings is to be insatiably curious on all
subjects. This of course is the ideal; nobody ever fully attains it.
Nevertheless Exercise M will set you to groping into certain broad matters
relevant to ordinary needs. Thereafter, if your purpose be strong enough,
you will carry the same methods there acquired into other fields of
knowledge.</p>
<p>You may object that all this is as much mental as linguistic—that what is
proposed will result in as large accessions of general information as of
vocabulary. Let this be admitted. Deficiencies of language are often,
perhaps almost invariably, linked with deficiencies of knowledge.
To repair the one we must at the same time repair the other. This may seem
a hard saying to those who seek, or would impart, mere glibness of phrase
without regard for the substance—who worship "words, words, words"
without thought of "the matter." There is such a thing as froth of
utterance, but who has respect therefor or is deceived thereby? Speech
that is not informed is like a house without a foundation. You should not
desire to possess it. Abroad in this world of ours already are too many
people who darken counsel by words without knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>    SUPPLEMENTARY LIST OF WORDS</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>You have already mastered many words, but a glance at any page of the
dictionary will convince you that you have not mastered all. Nor will you,
ever. Their number is too great, and too many of them are abstrusely
technical.</p>
<p>Nevertheless there remain many words that you should bring into your
vocabulary. Most of them are not extremely usual; on the other hand they
are not so unusual that you would encounter them but once in a lifetime.
The majority of them are familiar to you, perhaps; that is, you will have
a general feeling that you have seen them before. But this is not enough.
Do you know exactly what they mean? Can you, when the occasion comes, use
them?-use them promptly and well? This is the test.</p>
<p>Many of the words are absolutely new so far as this book is concerned.
They have not been discussed or attached to any list. Many are not
entirely new. They have appeared, but not received such emphasis that they
are sure to stand fast in your memory. Or some cognate form of them may
have been mastered, yet they themselves may remain unknown. Thus you may
know <emphasis>commendation</emphasis> but not <emphasis>commendatory</emphasis>, <emphasis>credulous</emphasis> but not
<emphasis>incredulity</emphasis>, <emphasis>invalid</emphasis> but not <emphasis>invalidate</emphasis> or
<emphasis>invalidity</emphasis>. One of the best of all ways to extend your vocabulary
is to make each word of your acquaintance introduce you to its immediate
kinsmen, those grouped with it on the same page of the dictionary.</p>
<p>This chapter puts you on your mettle. Hitherto you have been given
instructions as to the way to proceed, Now you must shift for yourself.
The words, to be sure, are corraled for you. But you must tame them and
break them, in order that on them you may ride the ranges of human
intercourse. If you have not yet learned how to subdue them to your will
and use, it would be futile to tell you how. You have been put in the way
of mastering words. The task that henceforth confronts you is your own.
You must have at it unaided.</p>
<p>It is true that, in the exercise that follows, specific help is given you
on a limited number of the words. But this help is only toward discovering
the words for yourself before you have seen them in a list. And for most
of the words not even this meager assistance is given.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>EXERCISE - Supplementary</p>
<p>Each of the following groups of words is preceded by sentences in which
blanks should be filled by words from that group. But do your best to fill
these blanks properly before you consult the group at all. You must learn
to think of, or think up, the right word instead of having it pointed out
to you.</p>

<p><strong>    RETROSPECT</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>DO you never, while occupying a dental chair and deploring the necessity
that drives you to that uncomfortable seat, admire the skill of the
dentist in the use of his instruments? A great many of these instruments
lie at his hand. To you they appear bewildering, so slightly different are
they from each other. Yet with unerring readiness the dentist lays hold of
the one he needs. Now this facility of his is not a blessing with which a
gracious heaven endowed him. It is the consequence and reward of hard
study, and above all of work, hard work.</p>
<p>You have been ambitious of like skill in the manipulation of words. Had
you not been, you would never have undertaken this study. You have
perceived that when you speak or write, words are your instruments. You
have wished to learn how to use them. Now for every idea you shall ever
have occasion to express await throngs of vocables, each presenting its
claims as a fit medium. These you must pass in instantaneous review, these
you must expertly appraise, out of these you must choose the words that
will best serve your purpose. With practice, you will make your selections
unconsciously. You will never, of course, quite attain the infallibility
of the dentist; for linguistic instruments are more numerous than dental,
and far more complex. But you will more and more nearly approximate the
ideal, will more and more nearly find that right expression has become
second nature with you.</p>
<p>All this is conditioned upon labor faithful and steadfast. Without labor
you will never be adept. At the outset of our study together we warned you
that, though we should gather the material and point the way, you yourself
must do the work. This book is not one to glance through. It is one to
dwell with, to toil with. It exacts much of you—makes you, for each page
you turn, pay with the sweat of your brain.</p>
<p>But, assuming that you have done your part, what have you gained? Without
answering this question at all fully, we may at this juncture engage in a
brief retrospect.</p>
<p>First of all, you have rid yourself of the notion that words are dead
things, unrealities worthy of no more than wooden and mechanical
employment. As much as anything else in the world, words are alive and
responsive, are fraught with unmeasured possibilities of good or ill.
You have taken due cognizance of the fact that words must be considered in
the aggregate as well as individually, and have reckoned with the pitfalls
and dangers as well as with the advantages of their use in combination.
But the basis of everything is a keener knowledge of words severally. You
have therefore come to study words with the zest and insight you exhibit
(or should exhibit) in studying men. Incidentally, you have acquired the
habit of looking up dictionary definitions, not merely to satisfy a
present need, but also to add permanently to your linguistic resources.</p>
<p>You have carried the study of individuals farther. You have come to know
words inside and out. Such knowledge not only assists you in your dealings
with your contemporaries; it illuminates for you great literature of the
past that otherwise would remain obscure. How much keener, for example, is
your understanding of Shakespeare's passage on the Seven Ages of Man
because of your thorough acquaintance with the single word
<emphasis>pantaloon</emphasis>! How quickly does the awe for big words slip from you
when you perceive that <emphasis>precocious</emphasis> is in origin the equivalent of
<emphasis>half-baked</emphasis>! What intimacy of insight into words you feel when you
find that a <emphasis>companion</emphasis> is a <emphasis>sharer of one's bread</emphasis>! What a
linking of language with life you discover when you learn the original
signification of <emphasis>presently</emphasis>, of <emphasis>idiot</emphasis>, of <emphasis>rival</emphasis>, of
<emphasis>sandwich</emphasis>, of <emphasis>pocket handkerchief</emphasis>! And what revelations as
into a mystic fraternalism with words do you obtain when you confront
such a phrase as "the bank <emphasis>teller</emphasis>" or "cut to the <emphasis>quick</emphasis>"!</p>
<p>Not only have words become more like living beings to you; you have
learned to think of them in relations analogous to the human. You can
detect the blood kinship, for example, between <emphasis>prescribe</emphasis> and
<emphasis>manuscript</emphasis>, and know that the strain of <emphasis>fact</emphasis> or <emphasis>fie</emphasis> or <emphasis>fy</emphasis> in
a word is pretty sure to betoken making or doing. You know that there are
elaborate intermarriages among words. You recognize <emphasis>phonograph</emphasis>, for
example, as a married couple; you even have confidential word as to the
dowry brought by each of the contracting parties to the new verbal
household.</p>
<p>You have discovered, further, that the language actually swarms with
"pairs"—words joined with each other not in blood or by marriage but
through meaning. You have so familiarized yourself with hundreds of these
pairs that to think of one word is to call the other to mind.</p>
<p>Finally, and in many respects most important of all, you have acquired a
vast stock of synonyms. You have had it brought to your attention that the
number of basic ideas in the world is surprisingly small; that for each of
these ideas there is in our language one generic word; that most people
use this one word constantly instead of seeking the subsidiary term that
expresses a particular phase of the idea; and that you as a builder of
your vocabulary must, while holding fast to the basic idea with one hand,
reach out with the other for the fit, sure material of specific words. Nor
have you rested in the mere perception of theory. You have had abundant
practice, have yourself covered the ground foot by foot. You can therefore
proceed with reasonable freedom from the commoner ideas of the human mind
to that expression of definite aspects of them which is anything but
common.</p>
<p>You have not, of course, achieved perfection. There still is much for you
to do. There always will be. Nevertheless in the ways just reviewed, and
in various other ways not mentioned in this chapter, you have made
yourself verbally rich. You are one of the millionaires of language. When
you speak, it is not with stammering incompetence, but with confident
readiness. When you write, it is with energy and assurance in the very
flow of the ink. Where you had long been a slave, you have become a
freeman and can look your fellows in the eye. You have the best badge of
culture a human being can possess. You have power at your tongue's end.
You have the proud satisfaction of having wrought well, and the
inspiration of knowing that whatever verbal need may arise, you are
trained and equipped to grapple with it triumphantly.</p>

<p><emphasis>Appendix I</emphasis></p>
<p>    THE DRIFT OF OUR RURAL POPULATION CITYWARD</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (An editorial)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>To an individual who from whatever motives of personal advantage or mere
curiosity has made himself an observer of current tendencies, the drift of
our rural population cityward gives food for serious reflection. This
drift is one of the most pronounced of the social and economic phenomena
of the day. Its consequences upon the life, welfare, and future of the
great nation to which we are proud to acknowledge our whole-hearted
allegiance are matters of such paramount importance to all concerned that
we should turn aside more often than we do from the distracting exactions
of our ordinary activities to give them prolonged and earnest
consideration.</p>
<p>A generation or so ago human beings were content to spend the full term of
their earthly existence amid rural surroundings, or if in their declining
days they longed for more of the comforts and associations which are among
the cravings of mortality, it was an easy proposition to move to the
nearest village or, if they were too high and mighty for this simple
measure to satisfy them, they could indulge in the more grandiose
performance of residing in the county seat. But nowadays our people want
more. Rich or poor, tall or dumpy, tottering grandmothers or babies in
swaddling-clothes, they long for ampler pastures. Their brawny arms or
hoary heads must bedeck nothing less than the metropolis itself, and
perchance put shoulders to the wheel in the incessant grind of the urban
treadmill. Can you beat it? Unquestioned profit does not attend the
migration. It stands to reason that some of the very advantages sought
have been sacrificed on the altar of the drift cityward. Let us say you
have your individual domicile or the cramped and sunless apartment you dub
your habitation within corporate limits. Does that mean that the
privileges of the city are at your disposal, so that you have merely to
reach forth your hand and pluck them? Well, hardly! You certainly do not
reside in the downtown section, or if you do, you wish to heaven you
didn't. And you can reach this section only with delay and inconvenience,
whether in the hours of business or in the subsequent period devoted to
the glitter of nocturnal revelry and amusement.</p>
<p>But whatever the disadvantages of the city, the people who endure them are
convinced that to go back to the vines and figtrees of their native heath
would be jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. Why? Well, for one
thing, there is no such thing as leisure in the areas that lie beyond
those vast aggregations of humanity which constitute our cities. Not only
are there innumerable and seemingly interminable chores that must follow
the regular occupations of the day, but a thousand emergencies due to
chance, weather, or the natural cussedness of things must be disposed of
as they arise, regardless of what plans the rustic swain cherishes for the
use of his spare time. Urban laborers have contrived by one means or
another to bring about a limitation of the number of hours per diem they
are forced to toil. To the farmers such an alleviation of their hardships
is not within the realm of practicability. They kick about it of course.
They say it's a blooming nuisance. But neither their heartburnings nor
their struggles can efface it as a fact.</p>
<p>Again, the means of entertainment are more limited, and that by a big lot,
with the farmer than with those who dwell in the cities. It is all very
well to talk about the blessings of the rural telephone, rural free
delivery, and the automobile. These things do make communication easier
than it used to be, but after all they're only a drop in the bucket and do
little to stop the drift cityward. We may remark just here that if you
live a thousand miles from nowhere and are willing to drive your Tin
Lizzie into town for "the advantages," you aren't likely to get much even
along the line of the movies, and you'll get less still if what you're
after is an A-1 school for your progeny.</p>
<p>Finally, the widespread impression that the farmer is a bloated and
unscrupulous profiteer has done much to disgust him with his station and
employment in life. We don't say he's the one and only when it comes to
the virtues. Maybe he hasn't sprouted any wings yet. What if he hasn't?
The cities, with their brothels, their big business, and their municipal
governments—you wouldn't have the face to say that there's anything wrong
with them, now would you? Oh, no! Of course not! The farmer pays high for
his machinery and goes clear to the bottom of his pocketbook when he has
to buy shoes or a sack of flour, but let him have a steer's hide or a
wagon load of wheat to sell, and it's somebody else's ox that's gored.
Consumers pay big prices for farm products, goodness knows, but they don't
pay them to the farmer. Not on your tintype. The middleman gets his, you
needn't question that. We beg pardon a thousand times. We mean the
middle_men_. There's no end to those human parasites.</p>
<p>And so farmer after farmer breaks up the old homestead and contributes his
mite to the drift cityward. What will be the result that comes out of it
all? The effect upon the farmer deserves an editorial all to itself. Here
we must limit ourselves to the effects on the future of our beloved
American nation. And even these we can now do no more than mention; we
lack space to elaborate them. One effect, if the tendency continues, will
be such a reduction in home-produced foodstuffs that we shall have to
import from other countries lying abroad a good portion of the means of
our physical sustenance, and shall face such an increase in the cost of
the same that thousands and thousands of our people will find it
increasingly harder as the years pass by to maintain their relative
economic position. Another effect will be that our civilization, which to
this point has sprawled over broad acres, will become an urban
civilization, penned in amid conditions, restraints, privations, and
perhaps also opportunities unprecedented in our past history and unknown
to the experience we have had hitherto. A final effect will be that our
most conservative class, the rural populace, will no longer present
resistance that is formidable to the innovations which those who hold
extreme views are forever exhorting us to embrace; and the result may well
be that the disintegration of this staying and stabilizing element in our
citizenship—one that retards and mollifies if it does not inhibit
change—will produce consequences in its train which may be as dire as
they are difficult to foretell.</p>

<p>    CAUSES FOR THE AMERICAN SPIRIT OF LIBERTY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (From the <emphasis>Speech on Conciliation with the Colonies</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By EDMUND BURKE</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In this character of the Americans, a love of freedom is the predominating
feature which marks and distinguishes the whole; and as an ardent is
always a jealous affection, your Colonies become suspicious, restive, and
untractable whenever they see the least attempt to wrest from them by
force, or shuffle from them by chicane, what they think the only advantage
worth living for. This fierce spirit of liberty is stronger in the English
Colonies probably than in any other people of the earth, and this from a
great variety of powerful causes; which, to understand the true temper of
their minds and the direction which this spirit takes, it will not be
amiss to lay open somewhat more largely.</p>
<p>First, the people of the Colonies are descendants of Englishmen. England,
Sir, is a nation which still, I hope, respects, and formerly adored, her
freedom. The Colonists emigrated from you when this part of your character
was most predominant; and they took this bias and direction the moment
they parted from your hands. They are therefore not only devoted to
liherty, but to liberty according to English ideas, and on English
principles. Abstract liberty, like other mere abstractions, is not to be
found. Liberty inheres in some sensible object; and every nation has
formed to itself some favorite point, which by way of eminence becomes the
criterion of their happiness. It happened, you know, Sir, that the great
contests for freedom in this country were from the earliest times chiefly
upon the question of taxing. Most of the contests in the ancient
commonwealths turned primarily on the right of election of magistrates; or
on the balance among the several orders of the state. The question of
money was not with them so immediate. But in England it was otherwise. On
this point of taxes the ablest pens, and most eloquent tongues, have been
exercised; the greatest spirits have acted and suffered. In order to give
the fullest satisfaction concerning the importance of this point, it was
not only necessary for those who in argument defended the excellence of
the English Constitution to insist on this privilege of granting money as
a dry point of fact, and to prove that the right had been acknowledged in
ancient parchments and blind usages to reside in a certain body called a
House of Commons. They went much farther; they attempted to prove, and
they succeeded, that in theory it ought to be so, from the particular
nature of a House of Commons as an immediate representative of the people,
whether the old records had delivered this oracle or not. They took
infinite pains to inculcate, as a fundamental principle, that in all
monarchies the people must in effect themselves, mediately or immediately,
possess the power of granting their own money, or no shadow of liberty can
subsist. The Colonies draw from you, as with their life-blood, these ideas
and principles. Their love of liberty, as with you, fixed and attached on
this specific point of taxing. Liberty might be safe, or might be
endangered, in twenty other particulars, without their being much pleased
or alarmed. Here they felt its pulse; and as they found that beat, they
thought themselves sick or sound. I do not say whether they were right or
wrong in applying your general arguments to their own case. It is not
easy, indeed, to make a monopoly of theorems and corollaries. The fact is,
that they did thus apply those general arguments; and your mode of
governing them, whether through lenity or indolence, through wisdom or
mistake, confirmed them in the imagination that they, as well as you, had
an interest in these common principles.</p>
<p>They were further confirmed in this pleasing error by the form of their
provincial legislative assemblies. Their governments are popular in an
high degree; some are merely popular; in all, the popular representative
is the most weighty; and this share of the people in their ordinary
government never fails to inspire them with lofty sentiments, and with a
strong aversion from whatever tends to deprive them of their chief
importance.</p>
<p>If anything were wanting to this necessary operation of the form of
government, religion would have given it a complete effect. Religion,
always a principle of energy, in this new people is no way worn out or
impaired; and their mode of professing it is also one main cause of this
free spirit. The people are Protestants; and of that kind which is the
most adverse to all implicit submission of mind and opinion. This is a
persuasion not only favorable to liberty, but built upon it. I do not
think, Sir, that the reason of this averseness in the dissenting churches
from all that looks like absolute government is so much to be sought in
their religious tenets, as in their history. Every one knows that the
Roman Catholic religion is at least coeval with most of the governments
where it prevails; that it has generally gone hand in hand with them, and
received great favor and every kind of support from authority. The Church
of England too was formed from her cradle under the nursing care of
regular government. But the dissenting interests have sprung up in direct
opposition to all the ordinary powers of the world, and could justify that
opposition only on a strong claim to natural liberty. Their very existence
depended on the powerful and unremitted assertion of that claim. All
Protestantism, even the most cold and passive, is a sort of dissent. But
the religion most prevalent in our Northern Colonies is a refinement on
the principle of resistance; it is the dissidence of dissent, and the
protestantism of the Protestant religion. This religion, under a variety
of denominations agreeing in nothing but in the communion of the spirit of
liberty, is predominant in most of the Northern Provinces, where the
Church of England, notwithstanding its legal rights, is in reality no more
than a sort of private sect, not composing most probably the tenth of the
people. The Colonists left England when this spirit was high, and in the
emigrants was the highest of all; and even that stream of foreigners which
has been constantly flowing into these Colonies has, for the greatest
part, been composed of dissenters from the establishments of their several
countries, who have brought with them a temper and character far from
alien to that of the people with whom they mixed.</p>
<p>Sir, I can perceive by their manner that some gentlemen object to the
latitude of this description, because in the Southern Colonies the Church
of England forms a large body, and has a regular establishment. It is
certainly true. There is, however, a circumstance attending these Colonies
which, in my opinion, fully counterbalances this difference, and makes the
spirit of liberty still more high and haughty than in those to the
northward. It is that in Virginia and the Carolinas they have a vast
multitude of slaves. Where this is the case in any part of the world,
those who are free are by far the most proud and jealous of their freedom.
Freedom is to them not only an enjoyment, but a kind of rank and
privilege. Not seeing there, that freedom, as in countries where it is a
common blessing and as broad and general as the air, may be united with
much abject toil, with great misery, with all the exterior of servitude;
liberty looks, amongst them, like something that is more noble and
liberal. I do not mean, Sir, to commend the superior morality of this
sentiment, which has at least as much pride as virtue in it; but I cannot
alter the nature of man. The fact is so; and these people of the Southern
Colonies are much more strongly, and with an higher and more stubborn
spirit, attached to liberty than those to the northward. Such were all the
ancient commonwealths; such were our Gothic ancestors; such in our days
were the Poles; and such will be all masters of slaves, who are not slaves
themselves. In such a people the haughtiness of domination combines with
the spirit of freedom, fortifies it, and renders it invincible.</p>
<p>Permit me, Sir, to add another circumstance in our Colonies which
contributes no mean part towards the growth and effect of this untractable
spirit. I mean their education. In no country perhaps in the world is the
law so general a study. The profession itself is numerous and powerful;
and in most provinces it takes the lead. The greater number of the
deputies sent to the Congress were lawyers. But all who read, and most do
read, endeavor to obtain some smattering in that science. I have been told
by an eminent bookseller, that in no branch of his business, after tracts
of popular devotion, were so many books as those on the law exported to
the Plantations. The Colonists have now fallen into the way of printing
them for their own use. I hear that they have sold nearly as many of
Blackstone's Commentaries in America as in England. General Gage marks out
this disposition very particularly in a letter on your table. He states
that all the people in his government are lawyers, or smatterers in law;
and that in Boston they have been enabled, by successful chicane, wholly
to evade many parts of one of your capital penal constitutions. The
smartness of debate will say that this knowledge ought to teach them more
clearly the rights of legislature, their obligations to obedience, and the
penalties of rebellion. All this is mighty well. But my honorable and
learned friend on the floor, who condescends to mark what I say for
animadversion, will disdain that ground. He has heard, as well as I, that
when great honors and great emoluments do not win over this knowledge to
the service of the state, it is a formidable adversary to government. If
the spirit be not tamed and broken by these happy methods, it is stubborn
and litigious. <emphasis>Abeunt studia in mores</emphasis>. This study renders men
acute, inquisitive, dexterous, prompt in attack, ready in defence, full of
resources. In other countries, the people, more simple, and of a less
mercurial cast, judge of an ill principle in government only by an actual
grievance; here they anticipate the evil, and judge of the pressure of the
grievance by the badness of the principle. They augur misgovernment at a
distance, and snuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze.</p>
<p>The last cause of this disobedient spirit in the Colonies is hardly less
powerful than the rest, as it is not merely moral, but laid deep in the
natural constitution of things. Three thousand miles of ocean lie between
you and them. No contrivance can prevent the effect of this distance in
weakening government. Seas roll, and months pass, between the order and
the execution; and the want of a speedy explanation of a single point is
enough to defeat a whole system. You have, indeed, winged ministers of
vengeance, who carry your bolts in their pounces to the remotest verge of
the sea. But there a power steps in that limits the arrogance of raging
passions and furious elements, and says, <emphasis>So far shalt thou go, and no
farther</emphasis>. Who are you, that you should fret and rage, and bite the
chains of nature? Nothing worse happens to you than does to all nations
who have extensive empire; and it happens in all the forms into which
empire can be thrown. In large bodies the circulation of power must be
less vigorous at the extremities. Nature has said it. The Turk cannot
govern Egypt and Arabia and Kurdistan as he governs Thrace; nor has he the
same dominion in Crimea and Algiers which he has at Brusa and Smyrna.
Despotism itself is obliged to truck and huckster. The Sultan gets such
obedience as he can. He governs with a loose rein, that he may govern at
all; and the whole of the force and vigor of his authority in his center
is derived from a prudent relaxation in all his borders. Spain, in her
provinces, is, perhaps, not so well obeyed as you are in yours. She
complies, too; she submits; she watches times. This is the immutable
condition, the eternal law of extensive and detached empire.</p>
<p>Then, Sir, from these six capital sources—of descent, of form of
government, of religion in the Northern Provinces, of manners in the
Southern, of education, of the remoteness of situation from the first
mover of government-from all these causes a fierce spirit of liberty has
grown up. It has grown with the growth of the people in your Colonies, and
increased with the increase of their wealth; a spirit that unhappily
meeting with an exercise of power in England which, however lawful, is not
reconcilable to any ideas of liberty, much less with theirs, has kindled
this flame that is ready to consume us.</p>

<p>    PARABLE OF THE SOWER</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Matthew 13:3,8 and 18-23)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side,
and the fowls came and devoured them up:</p>
<p>Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth:</p>
<p>And when the sun was up, they were scorched;
and because they had no root, they withered away.</p>
<p>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked them:</p>
<p>But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit,
some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</p>
<p>Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</p>
<p>When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not,
then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was sown in his
heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</p>
<p>But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he
that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it.</p>
<p>Yet he hath not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when
tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is
offended.</p>
<p>He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word;
and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, choke the
word, and he becometh unfruitful.</p>
<p>But he that received seed into the good ground is he that heareth the
word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and bringeth forth,
some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</p>

And all the men and women merely players:</p>

They have their exits and their entrances;</p>

And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>

His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,</p>

Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.</p>

And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel,</p>

And shining morning face, creeping like snail</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard</p>

<p>

Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Seeking the bubble reputation</p>

<p>

Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,</p>

In fair round belly with good capon lin'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,</p>
<empty-line/>

Full of wise saws and modern instances;</p>

And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His youthful hose well say'd, a world too wide</p>

For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,</p>

Turning again toward childish treble, pipes</p>

<p>    THE CASTAWAY</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (From <emphasis>Robinson Crusoe</emphasis>)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By Daniel Defoe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>And now our case was very dismal indeed; for we all saw plainly that the
sea went so high that the boat could not escape, and that we should be
inevitably drowned. As to making sail, we had none, nor, if we had, could
we have done anything with it; so we worked at the oar towards the land,
though with heavy hearts, like men going to execution; for we all knew
that when the boat came near the shore, she would be dashed in a thousand
pieces by the beach of the sea. However, we committed our souls to God in
the most earnest manner; and the wind driving us towards the shore, we
hastened our destruction with our own hands, pulling as well as we could
towards land.</p>
<p>What the shore was, whether rock or sand, whether steep or shoal, we knew
not; the only hope that could rationally give us the least shadow of
expectation, was if we might happen into some bay or gulf, or the mouth of
some river, where by great chance we might have run our boat in, or got
under the lee of the land, and perhaps made smooth water. But there was
nothing of this appeared; but as we made nearer and nearer the shore, the
land looked more frightful than the sea.</p>
<p>After we had rowed, or rather driven, about a league and a half, as we
reckoned it, a raging wave, mountain-like, came rolling astern of us, and
plainly bade us expect the <emphasis>coup de grâce</emphasis>. In a word, it took us
with such a fury that it overset the boat at once; and separating us as
well from the boat as from one another, gave us not time hardly to say,
"O God!" for we were all swallowed up in a moment.</p>
<p>Nothing can describe the confusion of thought which I felt, when I sank
into the water; for though I swam very well, yet I could not deliver
myself from the waves so as to draw breath, till that wave having driven
me, or rather carried me, a vast way on towards the shore, and having
spent itself, went back, and left me upon the land almost dry, but half
dead with the water I took in. I had so much presence of mind, as well as
breath left, that seeing myself nearer the mainland than I expected, I got
upon my feet, and endeavored to make on towards the land as fast as I
could, before another wave should return and take me up again; but I soon
found it was impossible to avoid it; for I saw the sea come after me as
high as a great hill, and as furious as an enemy, which I had no means or
strength to contend with: my business was to hold my breath, and raise
myself upon the water, if I could; and so by swimming to preserve my
breathing, and pilot myself towards the shore if possible; my greatest
concern now being that the wave, as it would carry me a great way toward
the shore when it came on, might not carry me back again with it when it
gave back towards the sea.</p>
<p>The wave that came upon me again buried me at once twenty or thirty feet
deep in its own body, and I could feel myself I carried with a mighty
force and swiftness towards the shore a very great way; but I held my
breath, and assisted myself to swim still forward with all my might. I was
ready to burst with holding my breath, when as I felt myself rising up,
so, to my immediate relief, I found my head and hands shoot out above the
surface of the water; and though it was not two seconds of time that I
could keep myself so, yet it relieved me greatly, gave me breath and new
courage. I was covered again with water a good while, but not so long but
I held it out; and finding the water had spent itself, and began to
return, I struck forward against the return of the waves, and felt ground
again with my feet. I stood still a few moments to recover breath, and
till the waters went from me, and then took to my heels, and ran with what
strength I had, farther towards the shore. But neither would this deliver
me from the fury of the sea, which came pouring in after me again; and
twice more I was lifted up by the waves and carried forwards as before,
the shore being very flat.</p>
<p>The last time of these two had well-nigh been fatal to me; for the sea
having hurried me along, as before, landed me, or rather dashed me,
against a piece of a rock, and that with such force as it left me
senseless, and indeed helpless, as to my own deliverance; for the blow,
taking my side and breast, beat the breath as it were quite out of my
body; and had it returned again immediately, I must have been strangled in
the water; but I recovered a little before the return of the waves, and
seeing I should be covered again with the water, I resolved to hold fast
by a piece of the rock, and so to hold my breath, if possible, till the
wave went back. Now, as the waves were not so high as at first, being
nearer land, I held my hold till the wave abated, and then fetched another
run, which brought me so near the shore that the next wave, though it went
over me, yet did not so swallow me up as to carry me away; and the next
run I took I got to the mainland; where, to my great comfort, I clambered
up the cliffs of the shore, and sat me down upon the grass, free from
danger and quite out of the reach of the water. I was now landed, and safe
on shore, and began to look up and thank God that my life was saved, in a
case wherein there was some minutes before scarce any room to hope. I
believe it is impossible to express, to the life, what the ecstasies and
transports of the soul are when it is so saved, as I may say, out of the
very grave: and I do not wonder now at that custom, when a malefactor, who
has the halter about his neck, is tied up, and just going to be turned
off, and has a reprieve brought to him—I say, I do not wonder that they
bring a surgeon with it, to let him blood that very moment they tell him
of it, that the surprise may not drive the animal spirits from the heart,
and overwhelm him.</p>
<p>    "For sudden joys, like griefs, confound at first."</p>
<p>I walked about on the shore, lifting up my hands, and my whole being, as I
may say, wrapt up in a contemplation of my deliverance; making a thousand
gestures and motions, which I cannot describe; reflecting upon all my
comrades that were drowned, and that there should not be one soul saved
but myself; for, as for them, I never saw them afterwards, or any sign of
them, except three of their hats, one cap, and two shoes that were not
fellows.</p>
<p>I cast my eyes to the stranded vessel, when, the breach and froth of the
sea being so big, I could hardly see it, it lay so far off; and
considered, Lord! how was it possible I could get on shore?</p>
<p>After I had solaced my mind with the comfortable part of my condition, I
began to look round me, to see what kind of place I was in, and what was
next to be done: and I soon found my comforts abate, and that, in a word,
I had a dreadful deliverance: for I was wet, had no clothes to shift me,
nor anything either to eat or drink, to comfort me; neither did I see any
prospect before me but that of perishing with hunger, or being devoured by
wild beasts: and that which was particularly afflicting to me was, that I
had no weapon, either to hunt and kill any creature for my sustenance, or
to defend myself against any other creature that might desire to kill me
for theirs. In a word, I had nothing about me but a knife, a tobacco-pipe,
and a little tobacco in a box. This was all my provision; and this threw
me into terrible agonies of mind, that for awhile I ran about like a
madman. Night coming upon me, I began with a heavy heart, to consider what
would be my lot if there were any ravenous beasts in that country, seeing
at night they always come abroad for their prey.</p>
<p>All the remedy that offered to my thoughts, at that time, was to get up
into a thick busby tree, like a fir, but thorny, which grew near me, and
where I resolved to sit all night, and consider the next day what death I
should die, for as yet I saw no prospect of life. I walked about a furlong
from the shore, to see if I could find any fresh water to drink, which I
did to my great joy; and having drunk, and put a little tobacco in my
mouth to prevent hunger, I went to the tree, and getting up into it,
endeavored to place myself so that if I should sleep I might not fall. And
having cut me a short stick, like a truncheon, for my defense, I took up
my lodging; and being excessively fatigued, I fell fast asleep, and slept
as comfortably as, I believe, few could have done in my condition, and
found myself more refreshed with it than I think I ever was on such an
occasion.</p>
<p>When I waked it was broad day, the weather clear, and the storm abated, so
that the sea did not rage and swell as before; but that which surprised me
most was, that the ship was lifted off in the night from the sand where
she lay, by the swelling of the tide, and was driven up almost as far as
the rock which I at first mentioned, where I had been so bruised by the
wave dashing me against it. This being within about a mile from the shore
where I was, and the ship seeming to stand upright still, I wished myself
on board, that at least I might save some necessary things for my use.</p>
<p>When I came down from my apartment in the tree, I looked about me again,
and the first thing I found was the boat, which lay, as the wind and sea
had tossed her up, upon the land, about two miles on my right hand. I
walked as far as I could upon the shore to have got to her; but found a
neck, or inlet, of water between me and the boat, which was about half a
mile broad; so I came back for the present, being more intent upon getting
at the ship, where I hoped to find something for my present subsistence.</p>
<p>A little after noon I found the sea very calm and the tide ebbed so far
out, that I could come within a quarter of a mile of the ship. And here I
found a fresh renewing of my grief; for I saw evidently that if we had
kept on board, we had been all safe: that is to say, we had all got safe
on shore, and I had not been so miserable as to be left entirely destitute
of all comfort and company, as I now was. This forced tears to my eyes
again; but as there was little relief in that, I resolved, if possible, to
get to the ship-, so I pulled off my clothes, for the weather was hot to
extremity, and took the water. But when I came to the ship, my difficulty
was still greater to know how to get on board; for, as she lay aground,
and high out of the water, there was nothing within my reach to lay hold
of. I swam round her twice, and the second time I espied a small piece of
rope, which I wondered I did not see at first, hanging down by the
fore-chains so low that, with great difficulty, I got hold of it, and by
the help of that rope got up into the forecastle of the ship. Here I found
that the ship was bulged, and had a great deal of water in her hold; but
that she lay so on the side of a bank of hard sand, or rather earth, that
her stern lay lifted up upon the bank, and her head low, almost to the
water. By this means all her quarter was free, and all that was in that
part was dry; for you may be sure my first work was to search, and to see
what was spoiled and what was free. And, first, I found that all the
ship's provisions were dry and untouched by the water, and being very well
disposed to eat, I went to the bread-room, and filled my pockets with
biscuit, and ate it as I went about other things, for I had no time to
lose. I also found some rum in the great cabin, of which I took a large
dram, and which I had, indeed, need enough of to spirit me for what was
before me. Now I wanted nothing but a boat, to furnish myself with many
things which I foresaw would be very necessary to me.</p>
<p>It was in vain to sit still and wish for what was not to be had; and this
extremity roused my application. We had several spare yards, and two or
three large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or two in the ship: I
resolved to fall tp work with these, and I flung as many of them overboard
as I could manage for their weight, tying every one with a rope, that they
might not drive away. When this was done I went down the ship's side, and
pulling them to me I tied four of them together at both ends, as well as I
could, in the form of a raft, and laying two or three short pieces of
plank upon them, crossways, I found I could walk upon it very well, but
that it was not able to bear any great weight, the pieces being too light.
So I went to work, and with the carpenter's saw I cut a spare topmast into
three lengths, and added them to my raft, with a great deal of labor and
pains. But the hope of furnishing myself with necessaries encouraged me to
go beyond what I should have been able to have done upon another occasion.</p>
<p>My raft was now strong enough to bear any reasonable weight. My next care
was what to load it with, and how to preserve what I laid upon it from the
surf of the sea: but I was not long considering this. I first laid all the
planks or boards upon it that I could get, and having considered well what
I most wanted, I first got three of the seamen's chests, which I had
broken open and emptied, and lowered them down upon my raft; the first of
these I filled with provisions—viz., bread, rice, three Dutch cheeses,
five pieces of dried goat's flesh (which we lived much upon), and a little
remainder of European corn, which had been laid by for some fowls which we
brought to sea with us, but the fowls were killed. There had been some
barley and wheat together; but, to my great disappointment, I found
afterwards that the rats had eaten or spoiled it all. As for liquors, I
found several cases of bottles belonging to our skipper, in which were
some cordial waters; and, in all, about five or six gallons of arrack.
These I stowed by themselves, there being no need to put them into the
chest, nor any room for them. While I was doing this, I found the tide
began to flow, though very calm; and I had the mortification to see my
coat, shirt, and waistcoat, which I had left on shore upon the sand, swim
away. As for my breeches, which were only linen, and open-kneed, I swam on
board in them and my stockings. However, this put me upon rummaging for
clothes, of which I found enough, but took no more than I wanted for
present use, for I had other things which my eye was more upon; as, first,
tools to work with on shore: and it was after long searching that I found
out the carpenter's chest, which was indeed a very useful prize to me, and
much more valuable than a ship-lading of gold would have been at that
time. I got it down to my raft, whole as it was, without losing time to
look into it, for I knew in general what it contained.</p>
<p>My next care was for some ammunition and arms. There were two very good
fowling-pieces in the great cabin, and two pistols. These I secured first,
with some powder-horns, a small bag of shot, and two old rusty swords. I
knew there were three barrels of powder in the ship, but knew not where
our gunner had stowed them; but with much search I found them, two of them
dry and good, the third had taken water. Those two I got to my raft, with
the arms. And now I thought myself pretty well freighted, and began to
think how I should get to shore with them, having neither sail, oar, nor
rudder; and the least capful of wind would have overset all my navigation.</p>
<p>I had three encouragements: first, a smooth, calm sea; secondly, the tide
rising, and setting in to the shore; thirdly, what little wind there was
blew me towards the land. And thus, having found two or three broken oars,
belonging to the boat, and besides the tools which were in the chest, two
saws, an axe, and a hammer, with this cargo I put to sea. For a mile, or
thereabouts, my raft went very well, only that I found it drive a little
distant from the place where I had landed before: by which I perceived
that there was some indraught of the water, and consequently, I hoped to
find some creek or river there, which I might malze use of as a port to
get to land with my cargo.</p>
<p>As I imagined, so it was. There appeared before me a little opening of the
land. I found a strong current of the tide set into it; so I guided my
raft as well as I could, to keep in the middle of the stream.</p>
<p>But here I had like to have suffered a second shipwreck, which, if I had,
I think verily would have broken my heart; for, knowing nothing of the
coast, my raft ran aground at one end of it upon a shoal, and not being
aground at the other end, it wanted but a little that all my cargo had
slipped off towards the end that was afloat, and so fallen into the water.
I did my utmost, by setting my back against the chests, to keep them in
their places, but could not thrust off the raft with all my strength;
neither durst I stir from the posture I was in; but holding up the chests
with all my might, I stood in that manner near half an hour, in which time
the rising of the water brought me a little more upon a level; and a
little after, the water still rising, my raft floated again, and I thrust
her off with the oar I had into the channel, and then driving up higher, I
at length found myself in the mouth of a little river, with land on both
sides, and a strong current or tide running up. I looked on both sides for
a proper place to get to shore, for I was not willing to be driven too
high up the river; hoping in time to see some ship at sea, and therefore
resolved to place myself as near the coast as I could.</p>
<p>At length I spied a little cove on the right shore of the creek, to which,
with great pain and difficulty, I guided my raft, and at last got so near,
that reaching ground with my oar, I could thrust her directly in. But here
I had like to have dipped all my cargo into the sea again; for that shore
lying pretty steep-that is to say, sloping—there was no place to land but
where one end of my float, if it ran on shore, would lie so high, and the
other sink lower, as before, that it would endanger my cargo again. All
that I could do was to wait till the tide was at the highest, keeping the
raft with my oar like an anchor, to hold the side of it fast to the shore,
near a flat piece of ground, which I expected the water would flow over;
and so it did. As soon as I found water enough, for my raft drew about a
foot of water, I thrust her upon that flat piece of ground, and there
fastened or moored her, by sticking my two broken oars into the ground-one
on one side, near one end, and one on the other side, near the other end;
and thus I lay till the water ebbed away, and left my raft and all my
cargo safe on shore.</p>

<p><strong>    READING LISTS</strong></p>
<p>One of the best ways to <emphasis>know</emphasis> words is through seeing them used by
the masters. For this reason, as well as for many others, you should read
extensively in good literature. The following lists of prose works may
prove useful for your guidance. They are not intended to be exclusive, not
intended to designate "the hundred best books." Rather do they name some
good books of fairly varied types. These are not all of equal merit, even
in their use of words. Some use words with nice discrimination, some with
splendid vividness and force. For each author only one or two books are
named, but in many instances you will wish to read further in the author,
perhaps indeed his entire works.</p>

<p>The index comprises, besides miscellaneous items, four large classes of
matter: (1) topics, including many minor ones not given separate textual
captions; (2) all individual words and members of pairs explained or
commented on in the text; (3) the key syllables, but not the separate
words, of family groups; (4) the first or generic term, but not the other
terms, in all assemblies of synonyms; hence, this book can be used as a
handbook of ordinarily used synonyms.</p>

<p>
Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.</p>
<p>
Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>
<p>START: FULL LICENSE</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</p>
<p>
To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>
<p>
Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works</p>
<p>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
<p>
1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
<p>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>
<p>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.</p>
<p>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>
<p>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
<p>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
<p>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>
<p>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
<p>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.</p>
<p>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>
<p>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
<p>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:</p>
<p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
<p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.</p>
<p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
<p>
1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>
<p>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

<p>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
