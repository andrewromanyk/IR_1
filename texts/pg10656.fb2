<p><strong>PREFACE.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The plays in this volume are printed for the first time. All are
anonymous; but it is absolutely certain that <emphasis>Sir John Van Olden
Barnavelt</emphasis> is a masterpiece by Fletcher and Massinger; that <emphasis>Captain
Underwit</emphasis> is a comedy of Shirley's; and that the <emphasis>Lady Mother</emphasis> (a piece
of no particular merit) is by Glapthorne. I am not at all sure that I am
right in ascribing <emphasis>Dick of Devonshire</emphasis> to Heywood. But, whoever may
have been the author, I am confident that this well-written play will be
welcomed by all. In <emphasis>Appendix I</emphasis> I give an account of the folio volume
(Eg. MS. 1,994) from which the two last pieces are taken.</p>
<p>To Mr. ROBERT BOYLE, of St. Petersburg, I offer my sincere thanks for
the very interesting note (<emphasis>Appendix II</emphasis>) which he sent me after reading
the proof-sheets of <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>. Elsewhere I have expressed my gratitude
to Mr. F.G. FLEAY for his valuable help.</p>
<p>The preparation of this volume has been a work of great labour, for
everything has been transcribed by my own hand; but the tedious delay in
publication has been due in great part to circumstances beyond my
control.</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO DICK OF DEVONSHIRE.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The play of <emphasis>Dick of Devonshire</emphasis>, now first printed (from Eg. MS.,
1994[1]), is distinctly a well-written piece, the work of a practised
hand. There is nothing amateurish in the workmanship; the reader is not
doomed to soar into extravagances at one moment, and sink into
flatnesses at another. Ample opportunities were offered for displays of
boisterous riot, but the playwright's even-balanced mind was not to be
disturbed. Everywhere there are traces of studious care; and we may be
sure that a style at once so equable and strong was not attained without
a long apprenticeship. Nor will the reader fail to note the lesson of
charitableness and Christian forbearance constantly, yet unobtrusively,
inculcated.</p>
<p>The hero of the play, Richard Pike, published, under the title of <emphasis>Three
to One</emphasis>, a pamphlet (reprinted in vol. i. of Mr. Arber's valuable
<emphasis>English Garner</emphasis>) describing his exploits. There is no date to the
pamphlet; but it was no doubt issued very shortly after Pike's return,
which took place on April 20, 1626. At the outset the writer apologises
for the rudeness of his style, "I know not," he says, "what the court of
a king means, nor what the fine phrases of silken courtiers are. A good
ship I know, and a poor cabin; and the language of a cannon: and
therefore as my breeding has been rough, scorning delicacy; and my
present being consisteth altogether upon the soldier (blunt, plain and
unpolished), so must my writings be, proceeding from fingers fitter for
the pike than the pen." In those days a soldier was never at a loss to
express himself, and honest Dick Pike was no exception to the rule. He
goes straight to the point, and relates his adventures very vividly in
the homeliest language. Returning from an expedition against Algiers
"somewhat more acquainted with the world, but little amended in estate,"
he could not long rest inactive; and soon, "the drum beating up for a
new expedition," set out to try his fortunes again. The design was
against Cadiz; the fleet, under the command of the Earl of Essex,
numbered some 110 sail. There is no need to continue the story, for I
have nothing to add to the facts set forth in the pamphlet and the play.
If <emphasis>Britannia's Pastorals</emphasis> had been written a few years later, we may be
sure that William Browne would have paid a fitting compliment to his
fellow-townsman's bravery. But Pike's famous deeds were not forgotten by
his countymen; for in a broadside of the late seventeenth century,
bearing the title of <emphasis>A Panegyric Poem; or, Tavestock's Encomium</emphasis>,[2] he
is thus enthusiastically praised:—</p>
<p>    "Search whether can be found again the like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For noble prowess for our Tav'stock Pike,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In whose renowned never-dying name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Live England's honour and the Spaniard's shame."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There is a curious notice of our hero in a private letter, dated May 19,
1626, of Dr. Meddus to the Rev. Joseph Mead:[3]—"Yesterday being Holy
Thursday, one Pyke, a common soldier, left behind the fleet at Cadiz,
delivered a challenge to the Duke of Buckingham from the Marquis of ——,
brother-in-law to the Conde d'Olivares, in defence of the honour of his
sister; affirming, moreover, that he had wronged Olivares, the King of
Spain, and the King of England, and therefore he would fight with him in
any part of France. This Pike, a Devonshire man, being presented
prisoner to the Duke of Medina, he would needs have him fight at rapier
or dagger with a Spaniard, supposing he would not stand him two thrusts:
but Pyke, by a dexterous sleight, presently disarmed the Spaniard of his
rapier without hurting him, and presented it to the Duke," &amp;c.</p>
<p>As to the authorship of the play, though I should be loth to speak with
positiveness, I feel bound to put forward a claim for Thomas Heywood.
Through all Heywood's writings there runs a vein of generous kindliness:
everywhere we see a gentle, benign countenance, radiant with love and
sympathy. On laying down one of his plays, the reader is inclined to
apply to him Tacitus' judgment of Agricola, "bonum virum facile
crederes, magnum libenter." Now, when we open <emphasis>Dick of Devonshire</emphasis>, the
naturalness and simplicity of the first scene at once suggest Heywood's
hand. In the second scene, the spirited eulogy on Drake—</p>
<p>    "That glory of his country and Spayne's terror,
    That wonder of the land and the seas minyon,
    <emphasis>Drake</emphasis>, of eternall memory—"</p>
<p>and the fine lines descriptive of the Armada are just such as we might
expect from the author of the closing scenes of the second part of <emphasis>If
you know not me, you know nobody</emphasis>. Heywood was fond of stirring
adventures: he is quite at home on the sea, and delights in nothing more
than in describing a sea-fight; witness his <emphasis>Fortunes by Land and Sea</emphasis>,
and the two parts of the <emphasis>Fair Maid of the West</emphasis>. But the underplot
bears even clearer traces of Heywood's manner. Manuel is one of those
characters he loved to draw—a perfect Christian gentleman, incapable of
baseness in word or deed. Few situations could be found more touching
than the scene (iii. 3), where Manuel defends with passionate
earnestness the honour of his absent brother, Henrico, and tries to
comfort his heart-broken father. Heywood dealt in extremes: his
characters are, as a rule, either faultless gentlemen or abandoned
scoundrels. Hence we need not be surprised that Henrico exceeds other
villains in ruffianism as much as his brother, the gentle Manuel,
surpasses ordinary heroes in virtue. The characters of Henrico's
contracted bride, Eleonora, and Catalina, the good wife of a vicious
husband, are drawn tenderly and skilfully. Heywood's eyes were oftener
dim with tears than radiant with laughter; yet, with all his sympathy
for the afflicted and the fallen, he never took a distorted view of
society, but preserved untainted to the end a perennial spring of
cheerfulness.</p>
<p>I now leave the reader to the enjoyment of this old play, which, whether
it be Heywood's or not, certainly deserves the attention of all faithful
students of our inexhaustible dramatic literature.</p>
<p>NOTE.—I gratefully acknowledge the assistance that I have received from
F.G. Fleay, Esq., in preparing this volume for the press. To ensure as
much accuracy as possible, Mr. Fleay has read the proof-sheets
throughout.[4] By the same gentleman's kindness I am able to correct the
following misprints in the first volume:—</p>
<p>p. 37, l. 23, for "Yet can give," read, "Yet can I give."</p>
<p>p. 71, l. 18, del. comma after "live."</p>
<p>p. 103, l. 9, del. "we."</p>

preferd," &amp;c.</p>
<p>p. 142, 9 from bottom, for "vouchsafed," read "vouchsafe."</p>
<p>p. 154, l. 19, for "There they are," read "I, here they are."</p>
<p>p. 190, l. 24, for "woman" read "women."</p>
<p>p. 194, l. 12, for "unwist," read "unjust."</p>
<p>p. 228, last line, for "Equire," read "Squire."</p>
<p>p, 258, l. 29, for "1639," read "1612."</p>
<p>p. 274, l. 16, for "whore," read "whore's;" and in the next line, for
"sunnes," read "sinnes."</p>
<p>p. 276, l. 4, after "Do not my Dons know," add "me."</p>
<p>p. 281, 4 from bottom, for "wo," read "two."</p>
<p>p. 311, l. 12, for "sol-Re-fa-mi," read "sol-Re-me-fa-mi." In l. 19, for
"Ra." read "Re."</p>

'Tis certaine there hath bene great preparation,</p>

The time of yeare is past, sir, now; more then</p>

Should we suspect for this Citty?</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Be at home delivered of no worse a conquest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then the last noble voyage made to this Citty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though all the wines and merchandize I have here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were ith' Seas bottome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1.                      Troth, so would I mine.</p>
<p>2. I nere could tell yet from what roote this huge
Large spreading Tree of hate from <emphasis>Spayne</emphasis> to us,
From us agayne to <emphasis>Spayne</emphasis>, took the first growth.</p>
<p>1. No? then lie tell you: let us season our sorrow
With this discourse.</p>
<p>2.                   With all my heart I long for't.</p>
<p>1. You shall not loose your longing: then, sir, know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hate a <emphasis>Spanyard</emphasis> beares an <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor naturall is, nor ancient; but as sparkes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Flying from a flint by beating, beget flames,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Matter being neere to feed and nurse the fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So from a tinder at the first kindled[9]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Grew this heartburning twixt these two great Nations.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. As how, pray?</p>
<p>1.               Heare me: any <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That can but read our Chronicles can tell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That many of our Kings and noblest Princes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have fetcht their best and royallest wives from <emphasis>Spayne</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The very last of all binding both kingdomes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within one golden ring of love and peace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By the marriage of Queene <emphasis>Mary</emphasis> with that little man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(But mighty monarch) <emphasis>Phillip</emphasis>, son and heire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To <emphasis>Charles</emphasis> the Emperour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2.                         You say right.</p>
<p>1.                                        Religion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Having but one face then both here and there,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Both Nations seemd as one: Concord, Commerce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sweete Community were Chaynes of Pearle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

About the neckes of eyther. But when <emphasis>England</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Threw of the Yoake of <emphasis>Rome, Spayne</emphasis> flew from her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Spayne</emphasis> was no more a sister nor a neighbour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But a sworne Enemy. All this did but bring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dry stickes to kindle fire: now see it burne.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. And warme my knowledge and experience by't.</p>
<p>1. Spaines anger never blew hott coales indeed
Till in Queene <emphasis>Elizabeths</emphasis> Raigne when (may I call him so)
That glory of his Country and <emphasis>Spaynes</emphasis> terror,
That wonder of the land and the Seas minyon,
<emphasis>Drake</emphasis>, of eternall memory, harrowed th'<emphasis>Indyes</emphasis>.</p>
<p>2. The King of <emphasis>Spaynes</emphasis> west <emphasis>Indyes</emphasis>?</p>
<p>1.                                      Yes, when his Hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Nombre de Dios, Cartagena, Hispaniola</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With <emphasis>Cuba</emphasis> and the rest of those faire Sisters,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The mermaydes of those Seas, whose golden strings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give him his sweetest musicke, when they by <emphasis>Drake</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And his brave Ginges[10] were ravishd; when these red apples</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were gather'd and brought hither to be payrd—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then the <emphasis>Castilian</emphasis> Lyon began to roare.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. Had he not cause, being vexd soe?</p>
<p>1.                                   When our shipps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Carrying such firedrakes in them that the huge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> Galleasses, Galleons, Hulkes and Carrackes[11]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Being great with gold, in labour with some fright,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were all delivered of fine redcheekt Children</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At <emphasis>Plymouth, Portsmouth</emphasis> and other <emphasis>English</emphasis> havens</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And onely by men midwives: had not <emphasis>Spayne</emphasis> reason</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To cry out, oh Diables <emphasis>Ingleses</emphasis>!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. It had not spoke such <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> else.</p>
<p>1. When we did sett our feete even on their Mynes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And brought their golden fagotts thence, their Ingotts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And silver wedges; when each ship of ours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was able to spread sayles of silke; the tacklings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of twisted gold; when every marryner</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At his arrivall here had his deepe pockets</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Crammd full of Pistoletts; when the poorest ship-boy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Might on the <emphasis>Thames</emphasis> make duckes and drakes with pieces</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of eight fetchd out of <emphasis>Spayne</emphasis>: These were the Bellowes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which blew the <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> bonfires of revenge;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These were the times in which they calld our Nation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Borachos,[12] Lutherans and Furias del Inferno.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. Would we might now give them the selfe same cause
To call us soe.</p>
<p>1.              The very name of <emphasis>Drake</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was a Bugbear to fright Children; Nurses still'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their little <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> Nynnyes when they cryde</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Hush! the <emphasis>Drake</emphasis> comes."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2.                         All this must needs beget
Their mortall hate to us.</p>
<p>1.                        It did; yet then
We lovd them beyond measure.</p>
<p>2. Why?</p>
<p>1. Why, did not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Spaine</emphasis> fetch gold from the <emphasis>West Indies</emphasis> for us</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To spend here merrily? She planted vines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We eate the Grapes; she playd the <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> Pavine[13]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Under our windowes, we in our bedds lay laughing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To heare such Mynstrelsy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2.                        How then turnd the windes?
Why did this beauteous face of love in us
Put on so blacke a Visour of hate to them?</p>
<p>1. Oh, sir, doe but looke backe to Eighty Eight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> glasse shall tell you, shew each wrinckle.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>England</emphasis> that yeare was but a bit pickd out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be layd on their Kinges Trencher. Who were their Cookes?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Marry, sir, his Grandees and great Dons of <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A Navy was provided, a royall fleete,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Infinite for the bravery of Admiralls,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Viceadmirall [sic], Generalls, Colonells and Commanders,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Soldiers, and all the warlike furniture</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cost or experience or mans witt could muster</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For such a mayne designe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2.                        Stay; Eighty Eight,—
Thirty eight yeares agoe: much about then
Came I into the world.—Well, sir, this fleete?</p>
<p>1. Which made the Sea fish wonder what new kingdome</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was building over theirs, beate downe the Billowes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before them to gett thither. 'Twas such a Monster</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In body, such a wonder in the eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And such a[14] thunder in the eares of Christendome</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That the Popes Holynes would needes be Godfather</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To this most mighty big limbd Child, and call it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Th'Invincible Armado.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2.                    Thats to say
A Fleete of Shipps not to be overcome
By any power of man.</p>
<p>1.                   These were the Whales,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These were the huge Levyathans of the Sea</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which roaring came with wide and dreadfull Jawes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To swallow up our Kingdom, Shipps &amp; Nation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fame of this Armado flew with Terrour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Riding on Envyes wing; the preparation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was wayted on with wonder, and the approach</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shewd the grim face of horrour: yet gainst all these</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our Country and our Courages were armd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. <emphasis>St. George</emphasis> for <emphasis>England</emphasis>!</p>
<p>1.                             And <emphasis>St. George</emphasis> we cryde,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Albeit, we heard, the <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> Inquisition</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was aboord every ship with torture, torments,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whipps strung with wyre, and knives to cutt our throates.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But from the armed winds an hoast brake forth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which tare their shipps and sav'd ours.—Thus I have read</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two storyes to you; one, why <emphasis>Spayne</emphasis> hates us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'other why we love not them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2.                            Oh, sir, I thank you.</p>
<p>                                          [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>SCENE 3.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Ent. Teniente, Don John, Henrico</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. I ever feard some ill fate pointed at
This Citty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>.       Makes the fleete this way?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                                <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. I did dreame every night of't, and the Ravens
With their unlucky throates never leave croaking
Some danger to us all.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                 Where's <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>? Villaine!</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. Be not discomforted.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>.                     Don <emphasis>Fernando</emphasis>, too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath cut our strength off, taken away our swords</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should save our throates. I did preiudicate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too rashly of the <emphasis>English</emphasis>; now we may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yield up the Towne.—Sirra, get you up to th'highest    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Turret, that lookes three leagues into the Sea,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tell us what you can discover there.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Why, I can tell you ere I goe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                                What?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Why there are fishes and shipps too in the sea; they were made
for that purpose.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. The fellow doates? climbe quickly, sirra, and tell us
Whither any bend to this place: there's a fleete
Abroad; skud, rascall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Villayne, away; and cast your eyes into the Sea.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Ile be hangd first; some wiser then some: mine Eyes into the Sea?
I see no reason for't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. Why stayest thou?—this slave is without sence.
Get up and see, and report the truth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Thats another matter: I will orelooke you all presently.
                                                        [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. What were I best to doe? I doe not like these Navyes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. 'Tis past question,
If they were kenn'd this way, that they intend
To make another meale of this Citty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. The first was but a Breakfast: they have shrewd stomakes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh for a lusty storme to bury all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their hopes in the waves now! one good swelling Gust</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would breake their ribbs in pieces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. No witches abroad?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>.                   I see, I see, I see!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano above</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. What?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Nay, I cannot tell what yet:
Something it is; I thinke it be a Towne.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Some Iland in the Sea!</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. It swims on the water.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. 'Tis the fleete: come they this way?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Yes, th'are ships; I know 'em by their foule linen; now I see
them plainely; they come, they come, they come!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. How far off?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. Speake, sirra.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. If you would peace I might heare what they say; the wind serves
to bring every word they speake: they make towards, yes, towards this
Citty. A great fleete! stay, stay, look to your selves, Don: they spitt
fire allready, and have hung up a thousand flaggs of defyance. They are
at the fort, the castle, at the castle: would I were pelted to death
with Oranges and Lymons.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. Here comes <emphasis>Don Fernando</emphasis>. What newes?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Fernando with Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Assured danger, gentlemen, for all our men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Already are in a palsye and doe flye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They know not whither. They are <emphasis>English</emphasis>:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Citty's allmost desperate.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>, come with me
And helpe to encourage the remayning soldiers.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. New supply shall quickly cheare you hearts.—
<emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. In this confusion, when a thousand feares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Present themselves &amp; danger with full face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lookes on the generall Towne, let me locke up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This Treasure in your armes; &amp;, for you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At least an equall interest with mee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>, in your fathers house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She may hope more security, being of strength;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For this storme cannot last. But in your love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She hath a stronger guard.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. This act of confidence
Binds me for ever to <emphasis>Fernando</emphasis>: come,
Halfe of my soule, for we two must not bee
In life devided. Though the Citty lye
At mercy of the Enemy, yet from
<emphasis>Don Pedro Gusman's</emphasis> house not all mankind
Shall take thee from me.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano and Spanyards flying</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. They come, they come, they come!</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Committing this my Jewell to your trust
I must unto my charge: my blessing!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Oh doe not leave me, sir; for without you
What safety can I have? you are my father:
Pray, stay you with me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>.                  Oh, my Girle, I cannot,
Dare not be so unfaithfull to the trust
His maiesty put me in, though I would stay.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. I feare if you goe hence all will not long be well.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Distrust you me, Eleonora?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                            No, indeed:
You ever had with me th'opinion
Of a most noble gentleman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>.                     What then?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. I know not what besides my feare; and that
Beggs I may share your fortune, since you may not
Take up such safety here as I have.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>.                              Come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are to blame: this heaven that now lookes on us</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With rugged brow may quickly smile againe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then I shall revisite my <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So, farewell.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Till then with greater care then were the Dragons</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Supposd to watch the Golden Apples growing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In the <emphasis>Hesperides</emphasis>, shall <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis> wayte</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On his best loved. Oh, my <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would to heaven there were no war but here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To shoote love darts! each smile from this fayre Eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May take an Army prisoners: let me give</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My life up here unto these lipps, and yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall, by the sweetnes of a kisse, take back</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The same againe. Oh thou in whom alone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Vertue hath perfect figure, hide not day</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In such a Cloud: what feare hath enterd here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My life is twisted in a Thread with thine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were't not defenced, there could nothing come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To make this cheeke looke pale, which at your Eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will not fall dead before you.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Sirra, let all your care and duty bee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Employed to cheere this Lady: pray, be merry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Oh, sir, yonders such doings.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Hell on your bawling! not a sillable to affright her,
or I shall tune your instrument there.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Hele breake the head of my instrument!
Why, sir, weomen are not affraid to heare of doings.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Still jarring?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. When the whole towne is altogether by th'eares you might give
me leave to jar a little my selfe:—I have done, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Putt on thy merryest face, <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. I have but one face, but I can make a great many.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. My best <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>, I shall soone returne:
In the meane time be owner of this house,
The possesour. All danger, sweet, shall dwell
Far off: Ile but enquire the state of things
In the Citty, and fly back to thee with loves wings.
                                              [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. I prithee call him backe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>.                           Signior <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>,
She has something more to say to you.    [<emphasis>Redit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. To me, sweetest?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                 <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>, doe you love me?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. By this faire hand.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                     And will you leave me, too?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Not for the wealth of <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Since I must be your prisoner let me have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My keepers company, for I am afraid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some enemy in your absence, like a woolfe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May ceize on me. I know not whither now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I ere shall see my father: doe not you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ravish yourselfe from me, for at the worst</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We may dye here, <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>; and I had rather</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fall in your eye than in your absence be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dishonord; if the destinyes have not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Spun out a longer thread, lets dye together.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Oh doe not racke my soule with these sad accents.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Am I <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>? there is not any place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can promise such security as this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>. Doe not talke of dying,</p>

<p>

Our best dayes are to come: putt on thy quiet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And be above the reach of a misfortune.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile presently wayte on thee, by this kisse.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Would I might keepe your oath: so please you, lady,
<emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis> will sweare too.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. That you'le be there and here agen presently.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Attend here, sirra.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. If you must needes goe, pray, sir, keepe yourselfe out of
Gun-shott.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Mind you your charge.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. You shall heare a good report of my piece, I warrant you.
Take heed you be not sent to heaven with a powder: a company of hott
shotts[15] are abroad, I can tell you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. If you will goe may your successe be faire.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Farewell; heaven cannot chuse but heare your prayer.
                                                    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Now what please you, madam? that I shall amble, trott, or walke?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Any pace.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Yet, if you would referre it to me, I'de use none of them.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. What wouldst doe?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Why I would gallop or run, for I think long till I be at home in
our Castle of comfort. If it please you Ile lead you a hand gallop in
the plaine ground, trott up hill with you &amp; racke[16] downewards.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Talke not of rackes, prithee; the times present too many.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Ride me as you will, then; I am used both to curbe and snaffle.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. I prithee tell me, <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>,—so, I heare thy master call thee—</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. He may call me at his pleasure, forsooth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Dost thou know the nature of the <emphasis>English</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Both men and women: I travelled thither with an Embassadour. For
the men Ile not misse you a haire of their condition; and for the women
I know 'em as well as if I had bene in their bellyes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Are they not cruell?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. As Tygers, when they set on't: no mercy unlesse we aske them
forgiveness.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. That's somewhat yet.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. But not to you; that's onely to men; for lett the women fall
downe afore 'em never so often they'le rather fall upon them. Nay, some
of them are so spitefull they'le breake their owne backes before they
let 'em rise againe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Foole, I meane not your way.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Keepe your owne way, madam; I meane the playne way.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Are they not unmercifull in their natures to such as are in their
power, their Enemyes as we may be?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Their enemyes as we may be in their power! I had rather be
cramm'd into a cannon and shott against their ships then you should
prove a witch &amp; tell true now. The <emphasis>Tartar</emphasis> is not halfe so grim; not
a <emphasis>Turke</emphasis> would use us so like <emphasis>Jewes</emphasis> as they will.
If it come to that once that they take the Towne
You will see <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> Dons heads cryed up and downe:
as they doe our Orenges and Lymons; and the woemens heads shall off,
too,—not a maydenhead of gold shall scape 'em.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. It is no valour to use Tyranny</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the conquerd: they have been reported</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A noble nation; and when last the pride</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of this Citty adornd their victory, by command</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or their brave Generall, no outrage ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The soldiers durst committ upon our persons:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though all our wealth ran in full streames upon them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our honours were preserved, or fame belys them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. No matter what fame sayes, perhaps I know more than she does;
&amp; yet, now you talk of valour, they are not comparable to us.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. How?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Why, valour is but the courage of a man; courage is, as they say,
the spirit of a man; and the spirit of a man is the greatnes, as we call
it, of his stomake. Now 'tis well knowen to the whole world they feed
better and eate more then we: ergo, we have better stomackes then they.
But, see! we have talk't our selves at home already, and the point
(port?) is open. Will't please you enter, or shall I enter before you?
I am your man, madam.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. You know the way best:—whilst abroad they are
At fight, twixt hope and feare at home I warre.</p>
<p>                                            [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>Actus Secundus</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>(SCENE 1.)</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Alarum; as the soft musicke begins a peale of ordnance
    goes off; then Cornetts sound a Battaile; which ended
    enter Captaine, Master of a ship, Dick Pike, with musketts</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Fought bravely, countrymen! Honour all this while</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sate in a Throne of smoake with sparckling eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Looking upon your courages &amp; admiring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your resolutions, and now rewards your sweat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With victory. The castle groanes at heart;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her strongest ribbs are bruizd with battering Cannons,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And she hath tane into her bowells fire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enough to melt her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. My Lord came bravely up to her &amp; shewd a spirit
That commands danger; his honorable example
Gave us new hearts.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. Faith, give the <emphasis>Spanyards</emphasis> their due; they entertaind us
handsomely with hott meat; 'twas no cold welcome.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. But I would not willingly swallow their plums; they would rise
shrewdly in a man's stomacke.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. At the first shott, when the <emphasis>Convertine</emphasis> came in, 3 men were
killd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. At the second 4, was't not?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. At the third two more: one salutation
Came so close that, with the very wind,
My hands have almost lost the sense of feeling.
<emphasis>Jewell</emphasis>, thou mad'st thy muskett spitt fire bravely.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. And my <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis> blade, honest <emphasis>Dick Pike</emphasis>,
Spard not his Sugar pellets among my <emphasis>Spanyards</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. He did like a soldier, as he that chargd his muskett told me:
in this service he hath dischargd 70 bulletts.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. I did my part, sir, and wish I had bene able to have layd 'em
on thicker; but I have lynd somebodyes gutts, much good doe 'em with it;
some of them have wishd well to me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Art hurt?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. Where?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Nowhere; one of my flanckes itches a little; if a piece of lead
have crept in to hide it selfe cowardly I am not much in debt for't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Let my Surgeons search it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Search a pudding for plums; let my flesh alone; perhaps it wants
souldering. Shall we to't agen: I have halfe a score pills for my
<emphasis>Spanyards</emphasis>—better then purging comfitts.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter a Soldier</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. What newes?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. The fort is yielded.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. They have bene speechlesse a good while; I thought they'de yield
up the ghost shortly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. But on condition to march away with flying colours, which was
granted.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. What's become of the Captaine of the fort?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. <emphasis>Don Francisco Bustament</emphasis> is carryed aboord our Generalls ship,
where he had a soldier like welcome; but he &amp; all his company are put
over to <emphasis>Port Reall</emphasis> upon the maine land because they should not succour
the Citty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Unles he will swim to th'Iland.—And how fares the <emphasis>Convertine</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. Her shroudes are torne to pieces &amp; her tacklings to raggs.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. No matter; she carryes the more honour.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. 5 hundred Bulletts sticke in her sides.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. 'Tis well they scaped her heart, lying all the fight little more
than pistoll shott from 'em; her Starboard still to the fort &amp; at least
200 Musketts playing upon her. I wish'd heartily some of our London
roaring Boyes[17] had bene in the heate of't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. Wouldst have 'em twice burnt.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. They should have found a difference betwixt the smoake of
Tobacco and of a muskett; another manner of noise than <emphasis>dam me &amp; refuse
me</emphasis>[18], which they vomitt dayly. It might have done some of 'em good,
for by that meanes they might have prayd heartily once in their lives.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. The <emphasis>Whitehall</emphasis>[19] men did good service.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. Who? the Collyers?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. 4000 Bulletts their ordnance &amp; the <emphasis>Hollanders</emphasis> dischargd upon
the Castle.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. 'Twas well done of all sides, Bullyes[20]: but, since our forces
are landed, let it be your care to looke well to the Ships: and honest
<emphasis>Dick</emphasis> of <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis> be not too carelesse of your hurts; he meanes to
fight againe that provides for his recovery soonest. Hold thee, here is
something to pay the Surgeon and to wash your wound withall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. My noble Captaine, I'le have care of my owne and drinke your
health with it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. Thou deservest more than common encouragement: prithee, remember
me too.</p>
<p>                               [<emphasis>Exeunt Capt. &amp; Mast</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Why, now am I sorry I have no more hurt, gentlemen; but I tooke
it as earnest to receive more if occasion bee. I have but a barrell to
bestow among my Dons; while that lasts let 'em come &amp; welcome,—the
drinke shalbe spicd to their hands. Their complexions are blacke, they
shall want no Balls to wash their faces; if any doe light in their
bodies they may chance be scourd all over.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. 2. We may hap to be in the suddes ourselves.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. There will be charges savd then; for my part I am but one, and
there are shotts enough.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. 2. More by a score then I hope wilbe payd these two dayes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Talke not of paying: here's more then a month comes to. Well,
if our service be done, &amp; there be any other liquor to be gott, wele
drinke no salt water as long as this lasts.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sol</emphasis>. 2. Come, let's have a dish to our countrymen &amp; let's remember
<emphasis>Tavestock</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Godamercy for that, boy. A match, a match!</p>
<p>                                              [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>

<p>(SCENE 2.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Henrico Gusman, his sword drawne, &amp; Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Yet the Citty is safe enough; feare not, <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Bullets make no noyse here: if the Towne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should yield her strength up to th'invader, thou</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Art lockd up like a spirit in a Christall:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not an enchanted Castle, held up by</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Strong charme, is halfe so safe. This house, though now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It carry not the figure &amp; faire shape</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which the first workeman gave it, eating Time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Having devourd the face of't, is within</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A Sanctuary, &amp; hath so much cunning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Couchd in the body not a Laborinth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is so full of Meanders.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                  Sir, your presence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Confirmes me in opinion of my safety;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not of my life so much, for that's a thing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I owe to nature &amp; should one day be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A-weary of it; like to Innes we take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our houses up, having but here a place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of <emphasis>Lodging</emphasis> not of <emphasis>dwelling</emphasis>:—but of <emphasis>honour</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You give me my assurance, for in such</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A time of thicke confusions I much feare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That might be hazarded. And who knowes what</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The soldier that hath no lawe but that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of cruelty and rapine, when like a Bird</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of prey his Tallents are possessd of one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So weake as I am—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.            He that durst offend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee with a sillable or but fright that bloud</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Out of thy Cheekes to seeke another place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not daring to be seene there where it now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is of itselfe sufficient to ravish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A mortall that with just eyes can looke on it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had better be a divell. But a haire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The poorest part of thee &amp; in this excellent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because 'tis thine, should any dare to ravish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From these his soft companions, which the wind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would be for ever proud to play withall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

H'had better dig his mothers coffin up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with his teeth eate what the wormes have left.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. I know you will defend me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                            Will defend thee!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have I a life, a soule that in thy service</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not wish expird! I doe but borrow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My selfe from thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.              Rather you put to Interest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, for that principall you have credited</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis> her heart is paid backe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the iust Usury.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.             You undoe me, sweet,
With too much love; if ere I marry thee
I feare thou'lt kill me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. How?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. With tendring me too much, my <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>;
For in my conscience thou'lt extreamely love me,
And extreames often kill.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. There can be no extreme of love[21], sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Yes, but there may; and some say Jealousy
Runs from the Sea, a rivolet but deducted
From the mayne Channell.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                   This is a new language.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Have you not heard men have been killd with Joy?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our griefe doth but contract the heart, &amp; gladnesse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dilate the same; and soo too much of eyther</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is hott i'th' fourth degree.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                       Sir, your discourse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is stuff of severall pieces and knitts not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With that you usd but now: if we can practize</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A vertuous love there's no hurt to exceed in't.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

—What doe you, Sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.               Looke on thee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Why doe you eye me soe? this is not usuall.
Are you well?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Well, never better.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Pray heaven it bode me no unhappinesse!
How doth my father?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. He's very well, too; feare not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Still I read in your eyes—</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What Babyes[22], prety one? Thy owne face, naught else;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I receive that way all this beauty into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My heart, and 'tis perhaps come backe to looke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Out at the window. Come, Ile winke againe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It shall not trouble you:—hence my trayterous thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Indeed you are not well.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Indeed I am not; all's not well within me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why should I be a villaine? <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doe not looke on me; turne those eyes away,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They would betray thee to thy sorrow; or</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lett me by parting carry along with me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That which to know undoes thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Are you not hurt?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Yes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Good heaven defend! I have a soveraigne Balme.
                                               [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Quitt your sharp stings! into what monstrous creature</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Feele I myself a-growing! yet I cannot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Force backe the streame, it comes so fast upon me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Here, good <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>, let me see your wound.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. No, I am well againe; thankes, my best love.
Come, let us walke and talke; I had a fancy,
But 'tis no matter:—<emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Did you call?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Yes, the Balme here—</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. What shall I doe with it?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Lay it up safe; 'tis good for a greene wound
But mines a blacke one:—and d'you heare, sirra,
Draw up the bridge, give entrance unto none.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. All my fellowes are abroad, sir; there's nobody at home but I.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. No matter, let none enter; were my father
Brought with a whirlwind backe, he finds all shutt
Till I have done.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Well, sir;—madam, all this is that you should not b' afraid:
you now see what a kind man he is,—he will suffer none to enter but
himselfe.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. If all this proceed out of your care of me, how much am I bound
to acknowledge you. Sir, methinkes you minde me not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Yes, I doe nothing else but thinke of thee, &amp; of my father, too,
<emphasis>Don Pedro</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Ha! I hope he's well.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. I wish he were returned, my <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>, for both our sakes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. The same wish I, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. That then our Joys, which now like flowers nippd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With frost, hang downe the head as if the stalkes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could not sustaine the toppes, they droope to much;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At his returne th'art mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                      I am yours now
In holyest Contract.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.               That's the ground we build on:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faith, since allready the foundation's layd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let's work upon't. Y'are mine, you say, allready—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mine by all tearmes of Law, &amp; nothing wanting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But the possession: let's not then expect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Th'uncertainety of a returne from France,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But be all one ymediately.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. I understand you not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Since y'are a Tree reservd for me what now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should hinder me from climbing? All your apples</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I know are ripe allready; 'tis not stealth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall rob nobody.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.              You'le not be a divell?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. No, I will but play the man with you: why, you know 'tis nothing.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Will you enforce mine honour? oh, <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where have you left your goodnesse? sure you cannot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be so ignoble, if you thinke me worthy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be your wife at least, to turne <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into a whore.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

The Quarter day,—I doe no more: by faire meanes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yield up your fort; the Tenement is mine owne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I must dwell in't.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                 My feares pointed wrong:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You are no enemy, no wolfe; it was</p>
<empty-line/>

Made pale with feare. Lay not a lasting blush</p>
<empty-line/>

On my white name:—No haire should perish here</p>

To mind your holy vowes; thinke on our parents,</p>

Ourselves, our honest names; doe not kill all</p>

With such a murthering piece. You are not long</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'expect, with the consent of men and angells,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That which to take now from me will be losse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A losse of heaven to thee. Oh, do not pawne it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For a poore minutes sin.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. If't be a worke, madam, of so short time,
Pray let me beg a minutes privacy;
'Twill be soone done.</p>

Oh, 'tis the devill's exercise! <emphasis>Henrico</emphasis>,</p>

<p>

You are a man, a man whom I have layd up</p>

Nearest my heart: in you 'twill be a sin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To threaten heaven &amp; dare that Justice throw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Downe Thunder at you. Come, I know you doe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But try my vertue, whether I be proofe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against anothers Battery: for these teares—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Nay, then I see you needs will try my strength:
My bloud's on fire, I boyle with expectation
To meete the pleasure and I will.
                                  [<emphasis>He forces her in</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Helpe, helpe!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Helpe? what nightingale was that? did one cry out for helpe?
there's no Christian soule in the house but they two &amp; my selfe; and
'twas not mine, I know by the smallnes of the voice; twas some woman
cryde out, &amp; therefore can be none but my young Lady,—it was she as
sure as I am hungry; he's with her. But why, having one man did she cry
out for more? oh, our <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> ovens are not heated with one Bavyn.[23]
Well, I must say nothing; my young Cocke has bene treading. Ile tread
softly &amp; see what they doe:—but, see!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Henrico &amp; Eleonora, loose haired and weeping</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What doe you looke after?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Why, sir, I looke after a voyce that appeard to me even now,
crying "helpe,"—a very small one.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. If what thou seest or heard'st be ever muttered by thee
Though in thy sleep, villaine, Ile pistol thee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Hum, it will not be safe to dreame of a knave shortly. Are you so
good at a gun? if you use this too often your birding piece will scarce
carry a yard levell.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Come, dresse your hayre up &amp; be wise at last:
No more, I have done.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. So I thinke in my conscience,—he hath done with her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. If you can be so simple to proclaime it,
I can be impudent.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Yet dar'st thou live? &amp; doe I live to see</p>

burnt you must be set light by, &amp; then you'le come to a temper.

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Pike with his sword in his hand, a Cloake in his Arme</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. The freshnes of this Ayre does well after the saltnes of the
Sea. A pleasant Country, too, to looke upon, &amp; would serve well to live
upon if a man had it &amp; knew how to place it out of this hott Clymate! I
would I had a matter, or a Mannour, indeede, of a 1,000 acres of these
woodlands &amp; roome to sett it in <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis>; I would compare with any
prince betweene <emphasis>Tavistoke</emphasis> &amp; <emphasis>Parradice</emphasis> for an Orchard. But I could
wish I were not alone here in this Conceit, dreaming of Golden Apples,
least they prove bitter fruite. Whether are our land soldiers straggeld,
troe? I would faine sett eye on some of them; Ile venture a little
farther; <emphasis>Devonshire Dick</emphasis> was never afraid yet.—How now, my hearts?
upon a retreat so soone?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Three Soldiers</emphasis>.</p>
<p>1. I, to the shipps; we have our loades here of the best merchandise we
can find in this Quarter.</p>
<p>2. Will you taste a Lymon? excellent good to coole you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. They are goodly ones; where gott you them?</p>
<p>3. A little above here in an Orchard, where we left some of our Company.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. But may one goe safe, without danger?</p>
<p>1. As safely as ever you gatherd nutts in <emphasis>England</emphasis>; the <emphasis>Spaniards</emphasis>
are all fled.</p>
<p>2. Not soe much as the leg of a <emphasis>Spanyard</emphasis> left to squayle at their
owne appletrees.
                                 [<emphasis>Exeunt Soldiers</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Ile have a pull at these pomcitrons for my noble Captaine;

<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter 3 other Soldiers</emphasis>.</p>
<p>1. They cannot be far before us, I am sure.</p>
<p>2. But for the hedge we might descry them within two muskett shott.</p>
<p>3. Pray God the enemy be not within one musket shott of us behind their
hedges; for I am sure I saw an Harquebuse whip ore the way before us but
even now. Oh, oh!</p>
<p>       [<emphasis>Three or 4 shott dischargd, 2 soldiers slaine,
       the other falls on his belly</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Pike</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Are you bouncing? Ile no further. Sure these can be no
Crowkeepers nor birdscarers from the fruite! what rascalls were my
Countrymen to tell me there was no danger!—alas, what's here? 3 of
our soldiers slaine! dead, shott through the very bowells! so, is this
quite dead too? poore wretches, you have payd for your Capon sauce.</p>
<p>3. Oh, oh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Here's some life in yt yet: what cheare? how is't, my heart of
gold? speake, man, if thou canst; looke this way; I promise thee 'tis an
honest man &amp; a true <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis> that speakes to thee. Thou look'st away
as if thou didst not trust me: I prithee speake to me any thing, Ile
take thy word &amp; thanke the, too. Alas, I feare he's past it; he strives
and cannot speake.—'Tis good to shift this ground; they may be charging
more hidden villany while I stand prating heere.—He breathes still;
come, thou shalt not stay behind for want of leggs or shoulders to beare
thee. If there be surgery in our ships to recover the use of thy tongue,
thou mayst one day acknowledge a man &amp; a Christian in honest <emphasis>Dicke of
Devonshire</emphasis>. Come along;—nay now I feare my honesty is betrayd;—a
horseman proudly mounted makes towards me, and 'tis a Don that thinkes
himselfe as brave as <emphasis>St. Jaques</emphasis>. What shall I doe? there is no
starting; I must stand th'encounter.—Lye still a while &amp; pray if thou
canst, while I doe my best to save my owne &amp; the litle breath thou hast
left. But I am in that prevented too: his breath's quite gone allready,
and all the Christian duty I have now left for thee is to close thy eyes
with a short prayer: mayst thou be in heaven, Amen.—Now <emphasis>Don Diego, &amp;
Don Thunderbolt</emphasis>, or <emphasis>Don Divell</emphasis>, I defye thee.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Don John arm'd. Pike drawes &amp; wrapps
    his Cloake about his arme</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. Oh viliaco, diable, <emphasis>Anglese</emphasis>!</p>
<p>                             [<emphasis>They fight</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. A pox upon thee, <emphasis>Hispaniola</emphasis>! Nay, if you be no better in the
Reare then in the Van I shall make no doubt to vanquish, &amp; vanquash you,
too, before we part, my doughty <emphasis>Don Diego</emphasis>.
                             [<emphasis>He hath him downe, &amp; disarmes him</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. And take your goods? is that your meaning, <emphasis>Don</emphasis>, it shall be
so; your horse and weapons I will take, but no pilferage. I am no
pocketeer, no diver into slopps: yet you may please to empty them your
selfe, good <emphasis>Don</emphasis>, in recompense of the sweet life I give you; you
understand me well. This coyne may passe in <emphasis>England</emphasis>: what is your
Donship calld, I pray.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>, a knight of <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. A knight of <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis>! and I a Squire of <emphasis>Tavestock</emphasis>: well, <emphasis>Don
John</emphasis>, I am a little in hast &amp; am unmannerly constreynd to leave your
<emphasis>Castilian</emphasis> on foote, while my <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis> worship shall teach your

<p>    <emphasis>Enter</emphasis> 12 <emphasis>musketiers</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Oh what a tyde of fortunes spight am I</p>

Now to swim through! beare up yet, Jovyall heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And while thou knowest heavenly mercy doe not start.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Once more let me embrace you, signior.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1. I say he is an <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis>: lett's shoote him.</p>
<p>2. I say the other is a <emphasis>Spanyard</emphasis> &amp; <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>; &amp; we dare not shoote
the one for feare of killing th'other.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. Oh hold and spare us both, for we are frends.</p>
<p>1. But by your leave we will part your embraces: so disarme, disarme.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. I thanke you, Countrymen; I hope you'le trust my honour with my
armes.</p>
<p>1. Yes, take them signior; but you will yeild the <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis> our
prisoner?</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. Yes, with a Villaines marke.    [<emphasis>He woundes him</emphasis>.</p>
<p>1. A villaines mark, indeed! wound a disarmed souldier!</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. He triumphd in the odds he had of me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And he shall know that from the <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> race</p>
<empty-line/>

Revenge, though nere so bloudy, is not base.</p>

<p>(SCENE 5.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Don Ferdinando, the Teniente, with
    attendants; Bustamente brought in with a Guard</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. <emphasis>Francisco Bustamente</emphasis>, late Captaine of the Castle,
Stand forth accusd of Treason gainst his Maiesty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. It is a language I not understand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And but that by the rule of loyalty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto my king and country I am made</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Attendant to the Law, &amp; in this honourd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Presence, the Governour &amp; <emphasis>Teniente</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Under whose jurisdiction I hold place,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not beare nor heare it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. I'de be glad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You could as easily acquitt your selfe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of guilt as stand up in your owne defence;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, <emphasis>Bustamente</emphasis>, when it doth appeare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To law &amp; reason, on which law is grounded,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your great offence in daring to betray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Spanish honour unto Infamy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In yeilding up the fort on such slight cause,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You can no lesse then yeild yourselfe most guilty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. Farre be it from your thought, my honourd Lord,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To wrest the hazardous fortune of the warre</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into the bloudyer censure of the Law.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was it my fault that in the first assault</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Canoniers were slayne, whereby our strength,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our mayne offensive strength, was quite defeated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And our defensive part so much enfeebled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That possibility to subsist was lost,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or by resistance to preserve one life?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While there was sparke of hope I did maintayne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fight with fiery resolution</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And (give me leave to speake it) like a Sodier.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. To my seeming your resolution
Was forwardest to yeild then to repell;
You had else stood longer out.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. We stood the losse of most of our best men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And of our musketiers no lesse then fifty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fell by the adverse shott; whose bodyes with their armes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were cast by my directions downe a well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because their armes should neyther arme our foes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor of our losse the sight give them encouragement.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. That pollicy pleades no excuse; you yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had men enough, had they bene soldiers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fit for a Leaders Justification.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And doe not we know that 6 score at least</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of those base Picaros with which you stuff'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The fort, to feed, not fight,—unworthy of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The name of <emphasis>Spanyards</emphasis>, much lesse of soldiers—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At once ran all away like sheep together,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Having but ore the walls descryde th'approach</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of th'Enemy? Some of the feare-spurrd villaines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were overturnd by slaughter in their flight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Others were taken &amp; are sure to find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our lawes as sharpe as either Sword or Bullet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For your part, <emphasis>Bustamente</emphasis>, for that you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Done heretofore more for your Countryes love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You shall not doubt of honourable tryall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which in the Court of warre shalbe determind,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At <emphasis>Sherris</emphasis>, whitherward you instantly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall with a guard be sent.—See't done: away.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. The best of my desire is to obey.</p>
<p>                         [<emphasis>Exit with a Guard</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Don John, Pike (with his face wounded}, a Guard of musketts</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Whence is that soldier?</p>
<p>1. Of <emphasis>England</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. Or of hell.</p>
<p>1. It was our chance to come unto the rescue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of this renowned knight, <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who was his prisoner as he now is ours.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some few more of his mates we shott &amp; slew</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That were (out of their <emphasis>English</emphasis> liquorishness)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bold to robb orchards of forbidden fruite.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. It was a fine ambition; they would have thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Themselves as famous as their Countryman</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That putt a girdle[25] round about the world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could they have said, at their returne to <emphasis>England</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto their Sons, "Looke Boyes; this fruite your father</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With his adventurous hands in <emphasis>Spayne</emphasis> did gather."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. 'Tis a goodly fellow.</p>
<p>1. Had you not better have gone home without Lymons to eate Capons with
your frends then to stay here without Capons to taste Lymons with us
that you call Enemyes?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. I could better fast with a noble Enemy then feast with unworthy
frends.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. How came he by these woundes?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Not by noble Enemyes: this on my face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By this proud man, yet not more proud then base;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For, when my hands were in a manner bound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I having given him life, he gave this wound.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. 'Twas unadvisd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>.                 The more unmanly done:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And though, <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>, by law y'are not accusd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He being a common Enemy, yet being a man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You in humanity are not excusd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. It was my fury &amp; thirst of revenge.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Reason &amp; manhood had become you better;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your honour's wounded deeper then his flesh.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet we must quitt your person &amp; committ</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis> to prison.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. To prison with him; but let best care be taken
For the best surgeons, that his wounds be look'd to.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Your care is noble, and I yeild best thankes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And 'tis but need, I tell your Seignioryes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I have one hurt more then you have seene,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As basely given &amp; by a baser person:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A <emphasis>Flemming</emphasis> seeing me led a prisoner</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cryde, "Whither doe you lead that <emphasis>English</emphasis> dog,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Kill, kill him!" cryde hee, "he's no Christian;"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ran me in the bodie with his halbert</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At least four inches deepe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Poore man, I pitty thee.—But to the prison with him.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captaine, Hill, Secretary, Jewell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Our Generall yet shewd himselfe right noble in offering ransome
for poore Captive <emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sec</emphasis>. So largely, too, as he did, Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. If any reasonable price would have bene accepted it had bene
given Mr. Secretary, I assure you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jew</emphasis>. I can testify that at our returne, in our Generalls name &amp; my
owne, I made the large offer to the <emphasis>Teniente</emphasis>, who will by no meanes
render him. Sure they hold him for some great noble purchace.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sec</emphasis>. A Barronet at least, one of the lusty blood, Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Or perhaps, Mr. Secretary, some remarkable Commonwealths man, a
pollitician in Government.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sec</emphasis>. 'Twere a weake state-body that could not spare such members.
Alas, poore <emphasis>Pike</emphasis>, I thinke thy pate holds no more pollicy than a
Pollax.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hill</emphasis>. Who is more expert in any quality then he that hath it at his
fingers ends; &amp; if he have more pollicy in his braines then dirt under
his nayles Ile nere give 2 groates for a Calves head. But without all
question he hath done some excellent piece of villany among the Diegoes,
or else they take him for a fatter sheep to kill then he is.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Well, gentlemen, we all can but condole the losse of him; and
though all that we all come hither for be not worth him, yet we must be
content to leave him. The fleete is ready, the wind faire, and we must
expect him no longer.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hill</emphasis>. He was a true <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis> blade.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sec</emphasis>. My Countryman, sir: therefore would I have given the price of a
hundred of the best Toledoes rather then heare the misse of him at home
complayned by his Wife and Children.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jew</emphasis>. Your tendernes becomes you, sir, but not the time, which wafts us
hence to shun a greater danger.</p>
<p>                                    <emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>(SCENE 2.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Pike in shackles, nightcap, playsters on his face; a Jaylor</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. The fleete is gone &amp; I have now no hope of liberty; yet I am
well refreshd in the care hath bene taken for my cure. But was ever
<emphasis>English</emphasis> horse thus <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> bitted &amp; bossd![26]</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. Sir, the care of your keeper, by whom this ease hath been
procured, requires remuneration.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Here's for you, my frend.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. I assure you, the best Surgeons this part of <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis> affoords,
through my care taken of you; &amp; you may thanke me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. What an arrogant rascall's this!—Sir, I thought my thankes
herein had chiefly appertaind to the humanity of the Governour, &amp; that
your especiall care had bene in providing these necessary shackles to
keepe me from running into further danger: these I tooke to be the
strong bonds of your frendship.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. Sir, I hope they fitt you as well as if they had bene made for
you. Oh, I am so much your servant that I doe wish 'em stronger for your
sake.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. 'Tis overwell as it is, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. You are most curteous.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. A precious rogue! If the Jaylors be so pregnant what is the
hangman, troe? By the time my misery hath brought me to climbe to his
acquaintance I shall find a frend to the last gaspe. What's here? a
Lady? are the weomen so cruell here to insult ore Captive wretches.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Catelyna &amp; Jaylor</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. Is this the English prisoner?</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. Yes, madam.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. Trust me, a goodly person.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. She eyes me wistly; sure she comes not to instruct her selfe in
the art of painting by the patternes of my face!</p>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. Sir, shall I speake with you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Yes, Lady, so you will not mock mee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. Indeed I cannot, but must needs acknowledge
Myselfe beholding to you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. This I must beare; I will doe soe &amp; call't my sweet affliction.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. Will you heare me, sir? I am the Lady—</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Yes, I doe heare you say you are the Lady; but let me tell you,
madam, that Ladyes, though they should have tenderest sence of honour &amp;
all vertuous goodnesse, &amp; so resemble Goddesses as well in soule as
feature, doe often prove dissemblers &amp; in their seemely breasts beare
cruelty &amp; mischiefe. If you be one of those, oh, be converted; returne
from whence you came &amp; know 'tis irreligious, nay divelish to tread &amp;
triumph over misery.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. How well he speakes, yet in the sence bewraying</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A sence distracted: sure his captivity,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His wounds, &amp; hard entreaty make him franticke!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pray heare me, sir, &amp; in two words Ile tell you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enough to win beleeife: I am the Lady</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the Knight vanquished by you, <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Y'have said enough, indeed: pitty of heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What new invented cruelty is this!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was't not enough that by his ruthlesse basenes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I had these wounds inflicted, but I must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be tortured with his wifes uniust reioycings!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Twas well his politicke feare, which durst not come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To glory in his handy worke himselfe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could send your priviledg'd Ladyship.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. Indeed, you much mistake me; as I live,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As I hope mercy &amp; for after life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I come for nothing but to offer thankes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto your goodnes, by whose manly temper</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My lord and husband reassum'd his life;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And aske your Christian pardon for the wrong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which by your suffering now pleads him guilty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good sir, let no mistrust of my iust purpose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Crosse your affection: did you know my love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To honour and to honest actions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You would not then reiect my gratulations.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And since that deeds doe best declare our meaning,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I pray accept of this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This money and these clothes and my request</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto your keeper for best meats and wines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That are agreable to your health and taste.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, honest frend, thou knowst and darest, I hope,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Believe me I will see thee payd for all.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. Yes, my good Lady.—Loe you, sir, you see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Still how my care provides your good: you may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Suppose the Governours humanity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Takes care for you in this, too.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Excellent Ladye I doe now beleive
Virtue and weomen are growne frends againe.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Don John</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. What magicall Illusion's this? 'tis she!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Confusion seize your charitable blindnesse!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are you a prison visiter for this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To cherish my dishonour for your merit?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. My lord, I hope my Charity workes for your honour,
Releiving him whose mercy spard your life.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. But that I'me subiect to the law &amp; know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My blowes are mortall, I would strike thee dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ignoble &amp; degenerate from Spanish bloud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Darst thou maintaine this to be charity?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy strumpett itch &amp; treason to my bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou seekst to act in cherishing this villaine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. Saints be my witnesses you doe me wrong!</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. Thou robbst my honour.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. You wound her honour and you robb yourselfe,
And me and all good Christians, by this outrage.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. Doe you prate, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Sir, I may speake; my tongue's unshackled yet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, were my hands and feete so, on free ground</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would mayntayne the honour of this Lady</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against an Hoast of such ignoble husbands.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. You are condemnd allready by the Law
I make no doubt; and therefore speake your pleasure.
—And here come those fore whom my rage is silent.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Ferdinando, Teniente, Guard</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Deliver up your prisoner to the <emphasis>Teniente</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I need not, sir, instruct you in your place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To beare him with a guard as is appointed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto the publicke tryall held at <emphasis>Sherrys</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. It shalbe done.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. How long hath he bene your prisoner?</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. 18 days.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. You &amp; the Surgeons out of the Kings pay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile see dischargd.—You have, according to the Order,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Conveyd already <emphasis>Bustamente</emphasis> thither</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To yeild account for yeilding up the Castle?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. 'Tis done, my Lord.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>, you likewise in his Maiesties name
Stand chargd to make your personall appearance
To give in evidence against this prisoner.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. I shall be ready there, my Lord.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. To <emphasis>Sherrys</emphasis>? they say the best sackes there.
I meane to take one draught of dying comfort.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cat</emphasis>. I hope you'le not deny my company
To waite on you to <emphasis>Sherris</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Jo</emphasis>. No, you shall goe to see your frend there totter.[27]</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. I have a suite, my Lord; to see an <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis>,
A merchant, prisoner here, before I goe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Call him; that done, you know your charge.</p>
<p>                                  [<emphasis>Exit Jaylor</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. And shall performe it.</p>
<p>                     [<emphasis>Ex. Fer., John, Catalina</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Jaylor &amp; Woodrow</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Oh, Mr. <emphasis>Woodrow</emphasis>, I must now take leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of prison fellowship with you. Your fortunes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May call you into <emphasis>England</emphasis>, after payment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of some few money debts; but I am calld</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unto a further tryall: my debt is life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which if they take not by extortion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I meane by tortures, I shall gladly pay it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Wo</emphasis>. I have heard, &amp; thought you by what I had heard
Free from feares passion: still continue soe,
Depending on heavens mercy.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. You doe instruct me well; but, worthy Countryman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Once more let me give you this to remember,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tis my last request:—that when your better stars</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall guide you into <emphasis>England</emphasis>, youle be pleasd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To take my Country <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis> in your way;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wheir you may find in <emphasis>Taverstoke</emphasis> (whom I left)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My wife &amp; children, wretched in my misfortunes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Commend me to them, tell them &amp; my frends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That if I be, as I suspect I shalbe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At <emphasis>Sherris</emphasis> putt to death, I dyed a Christian soldier,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No way, I hope, offending my iust King</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor my religion, but the <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> lawes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                                       [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>(SCENE 3.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Don Pedro, reading a Letter, &amp; Manuell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Dear sir, let me have power to recall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your graver thoughts out of this violent storme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of passion that thus oerwhelmes your mind.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Remember what you are, and with what strength,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What more then manly strength, you have outworne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dangers of Battaile, when your warlike lookes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have outfac'd horrour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>.               Oh, my son, my son,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Horrour it selfe upon the wings of Death,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stretcht to the uttermost expansion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Over the wounded body of an Army,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could never carry an aspect like this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This murthering spectacle, this field of paper</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stucke all with Basiliskes eyes. Read but this word,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'The ravisht <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>!'—does't not seeme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a full cloud of bloud ready to burst</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fall upon our heads?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Indeed you take too deepe a sence of it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. What? when I see this meteor hanging ore it?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This prodigy in figure of a man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Clad all in flames, with an Inscription</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Blazing on's head, 'Henrico the Ravisher!'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Good sir, avoid this passion.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. In battailes I have lost, and seene the falls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of many a right good soldier; but they fell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like blessed grayne that shott up into honour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But in this leud exploit I lose a son</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thou a brother, my <emphasis>Emanuell</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And our whole house the glory of her name:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her beauteous name that never was distayned,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is by this beastly fact made odious.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. I pray, sir, be your selfe and let your Judgement
Entertaine reason: From whom came this Letter?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. From the sad plaintiffe, <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Good;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And by the common poast: you every weeke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Receiving letters from your noble frendes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet none of their papers can tell any such tidings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. All this may be too, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Why is her father silent? has she no kindred,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No frend, no gentleman of note, no servant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom she may trust to bring by word of mouth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her dismall story.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>.           No, perhaps she would not
Text up his name in proclamations.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Some villaine hath filld up a Cup of poyson
T'infect the whole house of the <emphasis>Guzman</emphasis> family;
And you are greedyest first to take it downe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. That villaine is thy brother.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>.                                 Were you a stranger</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Armd in the middle of a great Battalion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And thus should dare to taxe him, I would wave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My weapon ore my head to waft you forth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To single combatt: if you would not come,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had I as many lives as I have hayres,[28]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'de shoot 'em all away to force my passage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through such an hoast untill I met the Traytour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To my dear brother.—Pray, doe not thinke so, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. Not? when it shall be said one of our name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Oh heaven could I but say he were not my son!)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was so dishonorable,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So sacrilegious to defile a Temple</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of such a beauty &amp; goodnes as she was!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. As beauteous is my brother in his soule
As she can be.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. Why dost thou take his part so?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Because no dropp of honour falls from him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I bleed with it. Why doe I take his part?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My sight is not so precious as my brother:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If there be any goodnes in one man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He's Lord of that; his vertues are full seas</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which cast up to the shoares of the base world</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All bodyes throwne into them: he's no drunkard;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I thinke he nere swore oath; to him a woman</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was worse than any scorpion, till he cast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His eye on <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>: and therefore, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hope it is not so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>.             Was not she so?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. I doe not say, sir, that she was not so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet women are strange creatures; but my hope</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is that my brother was not so ignoble.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good sir, be not too credulous on a Letter:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who knowes but it was forgd, sent by some foe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the most vertuous ever have the most?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I know my Brother lov'd her honour so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As wealth of kingdoms could not him entice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To violate it or his faith to her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhapps it is some queint devise of theirs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hast your journey homeward out of <emphasis>France</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To terminate their long-desired marriage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pedro</emphasis>. The language of her letter speakes no such comfort,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I will hasten home; &amp;, for you are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So confident as not to thinke his honour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Any way toucht, your good hopes be your guide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Auspiciously to find it to your wish.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Therefore my counsaile is you post before,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, if you find that such a wrong be done,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let such provision instantly be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betwixt you made to hide it from the world</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By giving her due nuptiall satisfaction,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I may heare no noise of't at my comming.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, to preserve the Reputation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of noble ancestry that nere bore stayne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who would not passe through fire or dive the mayne?</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>(SCENE 4.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Fernando &amp; Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Cease, Eleonora, cease these needles plaints,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Less usefull than thy helpe of hands was at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The deed of darkness,—oh, the blackest deed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That ever overclouded[29] my felicity!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To speake, or weepe thy sorrow, but allayes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And quenches anger, which we must now cherish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To further iust revenge. How I could wish</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But to call backe the strength of Twenty yeares!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. That I might be in that unborne againe, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. No, <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>, that I were so ennabled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With my owne hands to worke out thy wronge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon that wretch, that villaine, oh, that Ravisher!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, though my hands are palsyed with rage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Law yet weares a sword in our defence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Henrico</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Away, my Lord &amp; Father! see the monster</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Approaching towards you! who knowes but now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He purposeth an assassinate on your life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As he did lately on my Virgin honour?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Fury, keepe off me!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What life, what honour meane you? <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>,
What is the matter? Who hath lost anything?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Thou impudent as impious, I have lost—</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Doe you call me names?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. The solace of my life, for which—</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. A fine new name for a maydenhead!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. May all the curses of all iniured weomen
Fall on thy head!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Would not the curses of all good ones serve?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So many might perhaps be borne: but, pray,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tell me what moves you thus? Why stand you soe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Aloofe, my Lord? I doe not love to bee</p>
<empty-line/>

To th' very heart? Is't not enough, thou Traytour,</p>

To my poore Girles dishonour to abuse her,</p>

But thou canst yett putt on a divells visour</p>

To face thy fact &amp; glory in her woe?</p>

And twice dancd on the Sea before it, waving</p>

Flaggs of defyance &amp; of fury to it,</p>

Were nor before nor now this second time</p>

So cruell as thou. For when they first were here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now well nigh 40 yeares since, &amp; marched through</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The very heart of this place, trampled on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The bosomes of our stoutest soldiers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The weomen yet were safe, Ladyes were free</p>
<empty-line/>

And that by the especial command</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the then noble Generall: &amp; now being safe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From common danger of our enemyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou lyon-like hast broake in on a Lambe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And preyd upon her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. How have I preyd?</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>.                   Dost thou delight
To heare it named, villaine, th'hast ravisht her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. I am enough abusd, &amp; now 'tis time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To speake a litle for my selfe, my Lord.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By all the vowes, the oathes &amp; imprecations</p>

As I have a soule, as she &amp; you have soules,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I doe not know, nor can, nor will confesse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Any such thing, for all your Circumventions:</p>

By all that's good—</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. Peace, <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>; I have thought the Course.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you dare justify the accusation</p>
<empty-line/>

You shall to <emphasis>Sherrys</emphasis>, and then before the Judges</p>

Plead your owne cause.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                 And there Ile answer it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. There, if you prove the Rape, he shalbe forcd
Eyther to satisfy you by marriage
Or else to loose his periurd head.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. I am content.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And instantly I will away to <emphasis>Sherrys</emphasis>,</p>

There to appeale to the high Court of Justice:</p>

'Tis time, I thinke, such slanderous accusations</p>

Of much good sport: but I meane to looke to't.</p>

<p>

Now, sir, your newes?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. The most delicious, rare, absolute newes that ere came out
of <emphasis>France</emphasis>, sir!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What's done there? have they forsaken the Divell &amp; all his
fashions? banishd their Taylors &amp; Tyrewomen?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. You had a father &amp; a Brother there; &amp; can you first thinke upon
the Divell &amp; his Limetwiggs.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Had, <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>? had a father &amp; a Brother there? have I not so,
still, <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. No, sir, your Elder Brother is—</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What? speake, <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>: I imagine, dead.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Nay, you shall give me something by your leave; you shall pay the
poast:—good newes for nothing?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Here, here, <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>; speake quickly, crowne me with the
felicity of a younger brother: is he dead, man?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. No, he's come home very well, sir; doe you thinke I goe on dead
men's errands.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Pox on the Buzzard! how he startled my bloud!</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. But he is very weary &amp; very pensive, sir; talkes not at all,
but calls for his bed;—pray God your Father be not dead!—and desires
when you come in to have you his Bedfellow, for he hath private speech
with ye.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>, Well, sir, you that are so apt to take money for newes, beware
how you reflect one word, sillable or thought concerning <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>:
you knowe what I meane?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bus</emphasis>. Yes, &amp; meane what you know, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What's that?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Ile keepe your Counsaile</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Henrico (as newly risen)</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>! slave! <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano with Cloake &amp; Rapier</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Signior, what a buzzing you make, as if you were a fly at
Bartholomew-tyde at a Butchers stall: doe you think I am deafe?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. No, but blind; do'st sleepe as thou goest?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. No, but I goe as I sleepe, &amp; that's scurvily.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Call my brother Manuell.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Brother <emphasis>Manuell</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. How? pray (goodman rascall) how long have he &amp; you bene Brothers?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. I know not; may be ever since we were borne, for your father used
to come home to my mother, &amp; why may not I be a chipp of the same blocke
out of which you two were cutt? Mothers are sure of their children, but
no man is able to sweare who was his father.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. You are very lusty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. I eate eringoes[31] and potchd eggs last night.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Goe &amp; call him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. What?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. You hound, is he up?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. No, he's in Bed, and yet he may be up too; Ile goe see.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Stay, and speake low.—How now?</p>
<p>                                          [<emphasis>Buz. falls downe</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. I can speake no lower unlesse I creepe into the Cellar.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. I'me glad you are so merry, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. So am I; my heart is a fiddle; the strings are rozend with ioy
that my other young Mr. is come home, &amp; my tongue the sticke that makes
the fiddle squeake.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Come hither, leave your fooling &amp; tell me truely: didst sleepe
to night or no?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Sleepe? Not that I remember: Ile sweare (&amp; my eyes should come
out as 2 witnesses) that I nere slept worse; for what with ycur
<emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> flyes (the pocky, stinging musquitoes) &amp; what with your skip
Jacke fleas, the nap of my sleepe was worne off.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Didst heare nothing?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Not in my sleepe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Collect thy sences; when thou wert awake didst thou heare
nothing?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Nothing.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Twixt 12 &amp; one?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. 12 &amp; one? Then was I in my dead sleepe, cursing the fleas.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Or about one &amp; two.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. That's Three:—Now the Beetle[32] of my head beates it into my
memory that as you &amp; your brother <emphasis>Manuell</emphasis> lay in the high Bed, &amp; I
trondling[33] underneath, I heard one of you talke most stigmatically in
his sleepe—most horriferously.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Right, now thou com'st to me,—so did I.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. And then once or twice the sleepy voice cryde out, "Oh it was I
that murthered him! this hand killd him!"</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Art sure thou heardst this?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Am I sure these are my eares?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. And dar'st thou sweare thou heardst it?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Lay downe 20 oathes, and see if Ile not take them.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. And whose voice was it did appeare to thee?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Whose voice was it? Well said, yong Master! make an asse of your
fathers man!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Come, come, be serious: whose voice?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Whose voice? why then, if your windpipe were slitt now and opend,
there should the voice be found. I durst at midnight be sworne that the
Ghost of your voice appeard before me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. No; me it frighted too; up stood my haire stiffe &amp; on end.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. As a Catts does at sight of a dog.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. A cold sweat pearld in dropps all ore my body;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For 'twas my Brothers voice, &amp; were I calld</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Before a thousand Judges I must sweare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It could be no mans els.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Why, then, I must sweare so, too.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. "Oh it was I that murthered him! this hand killed him!"</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Within, Man</emphasis>] <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. He's up.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Man</emphasis>.] <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. I come.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Helpe to make him ready,[34] but not a word on thy life.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Mum.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. So let it worke; thus far my wheeles goe true.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because a Captaine, leading up his men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In the proud van, has honour above them,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And they his vassailes; must my elder brother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Leave me a slave to the world? &amp; why, forsooth?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because he gott the start in my mother's belly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be before me there. All younger brothers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Must sitt beneath the salt[35] &amp; take what dishes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The elder shoves downe to them. I doe not like</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This kind of service: could I, by this tricke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of a voice counterfeited &amp; confessing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The murther of my father, trusse up this yonker</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so make my selfe heire &amp; a yonger brother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of him, 'twere a good dayes worke. Wer't not fine angling?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hold line and hook: Ile puzzle him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Manuell &amp; Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Morrow, brother.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Oh, good morrow: you have slept soundly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Travellers that are weary have sleepe led in a string.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. So doe those that are hangd: all that travell &amp; are weary doe
not sleepe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Why, Mr. <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>, why?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Midwives travell at night &amp; are weary with eating groaning
pyes[36], &amp; yet sleepe not: shall I hooke you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Hooke me? what meanst?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. These Taylors are the wittyest knaves that live by bread.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. And why witty, out of your wisdome?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. In old time gentlemen would call to their men &amp; cry, "Come,
trusse me": now the word is "Come, hooke me"; for every body now lookes
so narrowly to Taylors bills (some for very anger never paying them)
that the needle lance knights, in revenge of those prying eyes, put so
many hookes &amp; eyes to every hose &amp; dubblet.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Well, sir, Ile not be hookd then now.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Tis well if you be not.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. <emphasis>France</emphasis> is an excellent country.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Oh, a brave one.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Your Monsieurs gallant sparkes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Sparkes? oh, sir, all fire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The soule of complement, courtship &amp; fine language;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Witty &amp; active; lovers of faire Ladyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Short naggs &amp; <emphasis>English</emphasis> mastives; proud, fantasticke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet such a pride &amp; such fantasticknes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It so becomes them, other Nations</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Especially the English) hold themselves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No perfect gentlemen till frenchifyed.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Tush, <emphasis>England</emphasis> breeds more apes than <emphasis>Barbary</emphasis>.—
How chance my father came not home with you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. He was too hard tyed by the leg with busines.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What busines?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>.               Tis but stepping into <emphasis>France</emphasis>.
And he perhaps will tell you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                        Perhaps? tis well:
What part of <emphasis>France</emphasis> did you leave him in?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. What part? why I left him at <emphasis>Nancy</emphasis> in <emphasis>Lorraine</emphasis>. No, no,
I lye, now I remember me twas at <emphasis>Chaalons</emphasis> in <emphasis>Burgundy</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Hoyda, a most loving child</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That knowes not where he left his father, &amp; yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Comes but now from him! had you left in <emphasis>France</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your whore behind you, in your Table bookes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You would have sett downe the streets very name,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yes, and the baudy signe, too.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>.                         Hum, you say well, sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now you are up to th'eares in Baudery,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pray tell me one thing, Brother; (I am sorry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To putt forth such a question) but speake truly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have you not in my fathers absence done</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A piece of worke (not your best masterpiece)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But such an one as on the house of <emphasis>Guzman</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will plucke a vengeance, &amp; on the good old man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Our noble father) heape such hills of sorrow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To beate him into his grave?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                       What's this your foolery?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Pray heaven it prove soe: have not you defac'd
That sweet &amp; matchles goodnes, <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>,
<emphasis>Fernando's</emphasis> daughter?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. How defacd her?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Hearke, sir: playd <emphasis>Tarquin's</emphasis> part and ravisht her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. 'Tis a lye.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. I hope so too.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. What villaine speakes it?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. One with so wide a throat, that uttering it
'Twas heard in <emphasis>France</emphasis>; a letter, sir, informed
My father so.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Letter? from whom?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. A woman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. She's a whore.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Twas <emphasis>Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. She's, then, a villanous strumpet so to write,
And you an asse, a coxcomb to beleeve it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Nettled? then let me tell you that I feare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall for ever blush when in my hearing</p>
<empty-line/>

Any names <emphasis>Henrico Guzman</emphasis> for my brother.</p>

In right of vertue &amp; a womans honour</p>

Panting upon my weapons point; then part us.
Oh, pray, forbeare the roome.</p>

<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>.                       Be advisd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Lay hold on him, the murtherer of my father:

Too deepe, I feare, in Law.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Pike, shackled, &amp; his Jaylour</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. Boon Coragio, man! how is't?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Not very well &amp; yet well enough, considering how the cheating
dice of the world run.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. I dare not, though I have a care of you, ease you of one Iron
unles I desire such Gyves my selfe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Las, if they were all knockt off I'me loaden with Gyves,
Shackles, and fetters enough for the arrantest theefe that ever lay in
my owne country in Newgate.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. Shackles, gyves, and fetters enough! I see none but these at your
heeles, which come on without a shoeing horne.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Yes, at my heart I weare them—a wife &amp; children (my poore
Lambes at home); there's a chaine of sighes and sobbes and sorrow,
harder then any Iron; and this chaine is so long it reaches from
<emphasis>Sherrys</emphasis> to <emphasis>Tavestock</emphasis> in <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. That's farre enough in Conscience.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Could I shake those Chaines off I would cutt Capers: poore
<emphasis>Dick Pike</emphasis> would dance though Death pip'd to him; yes, and spitt in
your Hangman's face.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. Not too much of that nayther: some 2 dayes hence he will give you
a choake peare[39] will spoyle your spitting.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Pheu!</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. For, let me see, to-day is Sunday; to-morrow the Lords sitt, and
then I must have a care—a cruell care—to have your leggs handsome and
a new cleane ruff band about your necke, of old rusty iron; 'twill purge
your choller.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. I, I, let it, let it: Collers, halters, &amp; hangmen are to me
bracelets and frendly companions.</p>
<p>                                  [<emphasis>Knocking-within</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. So hasty? stay my leasure.—(<emphasis>Enter 2 fryers</emphasis>)
Two fryers come to prepare you.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>I. Hayle, Countryman! for we, though fryers in <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis>,</p>

<p>

Were born in <emphasis>Ireland</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                 Reverend sir, y'are welcome:
Too few such visitants, nay none at all,
Have I seen in this damnable Limbo.</p>
<p>2. Brother, take heed; doe not misuse that word
Of Limbo.[40]</p>
<p>1.        Brother <emphasis>Pike</emphasis>, for so we heare,</p>

Men call you, we are come in pure devotion</p>

And charity to your soule, being thereto bound</p>

<p>1.                                  To point with our fingers</p>
<empty-line/>

Out all such rockes, shelves, quicksands, gulfes, &amp; shallowes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lying in the sea through which you are to passe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In the most dangerous voyage you ere made:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Eyther by our care to sett you safe on land,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or, if you fly from us your heavenly pilotts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sure to be wrackt for ever.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                     What must I doe?</p>
<p>2. Confesse to one of us what rancke and foule impostumes
Have bred about your soule.</p>
<p>1.                          What Leprosies
Have run ore all your Conscience.</p>
<p>2.                                What hott feavers
Now shake your peace of mind.</p>
<p>1.                            For we are come
To cure your old Corruptions.</p>
<p>2.                            We are come
To be your true and free Physitians.</p>
<p>1. Without the hope of gold, to give you health.</p>
<p>2. To sett you on your feete on the right way.</p>
<p>1. To <emphasis>Palestine</emphasis>, the <emphasis>New Jerusalem</emphasis>.</p>
<p>2.                                      Say;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will you unlocke the closet of your heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To one of us? chuse which, &amp; be absolvd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For all your blacke Crimes on a free confession?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1. To him or me, for you must dye to morrow.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Welcome!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To morrow shall I be in another country,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where are no Examiners, nor Jayles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor bolts, nor barres, nor irons. I beseech you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give me a little respite to retire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into the next roome, &amp; I will instantly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Returne to give you satisfaction.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ambo</emphasis>. Goe, brother.</p>
<p>1. A goodly man!</p>
<p>2. Well limbd &amp; strong of heart.</p>
<p>1. Now I well view his face did not we two</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At our last being in <emphasis>Plymouth</emphasis> in disguise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When there the King of <emphasis>England</emphasis> rode about</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To see the soldiers in their musterings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And what their armes were, just before this fleet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sett out, did we not see him there?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. May be we did; I know not; if he were there 'tis now out of my
memory.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Pike</emphasis>.</p>
<p>1. Are you resolvd?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Yes.</p>
<p>2. To confesse?</p>

<p>1. To whom?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. To one who is in better place</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And greater power then you to cure my sicke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Infected part, though maladies as infinite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the sea sands, the grassy spears on earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or as the dropps of raine &amp; stars in the firmament</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stucke on me he can cleare all, cleanse me throughly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2. You will not then confesse?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. No, I confesse I will not.</p>
<p>1. We are sorry for you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Countryes sake this Counsaile do I give you:</p>

<p>

When y'are before the Lords rule well your tongue,</p>

Be wary how you answer, least they tripp you;</p>

<p>

As you in <emphasis>England</emphasis>.</p>

<p>2. Prepare to dye.
                     [<emphasis>Exeunt Fryers</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. I will so.—Prepare to dye! An excellent bell &amp; it sounds
sweetly. He that prepares to dye rigges a goodly ship; he that is well
prepard is ready to launch forth; he that prepares well &amp; dyes well,
arrives at a happy haven. Prepare to dye! preparation is the sauce,
death the meate, my soule &amp; body the guests; &amp; to this feast will I goe,
boldly as a man, humbly as a Christian, &amp; bravely as an <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis>. Oh

<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. An <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis>.</p>
<p>3. A dog!</p>
<p>1. A divell!</p>
<p>2. Let's beate out his braines with our Irons.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. On, on; leave rayling, cursing &amp; lying: had you not run from the
Castle the hangman &amp; you had bene "hayle fellow! well met:" On!</p>

          [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Bustamente shackled, &amp; Jaylor</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. Whither dost lead me?</p>

nurse children.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. I have worne better <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> gaiters: thus rewarded for my
service!</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. See, Capt. <emphasis>Bustamente</emphasis>; doe you know this fellow?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. No.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. The Englishman brought prisoner into the Citty, &amp; from thence
hither.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Oh, Captaine, I saw you at the fort performe the part of a man.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. And now thou seest me acting the part of a slave. Farewell,
soldier. I did not hate thee at the first, though there we mett enemyes;
and if thou &amp; I take our leaves at the Gallowes, prithee letts part
friends.
            [_A Table out, sword &amp; papers[42]</p>

at the winning of the fort we had a brave breakfast.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bust</emphasis>. True, but I doubt not we shall have worse cheare at dinner.</p>

For his mind.</p>

<p><emphasis>Clarke</emphasis>. Silence!</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. You see how much our <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> soldiers love you
To give this brave attendance; though your Nation
Fought us &amp; came to hunt us to our deathes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. My Lords, this, which in shew is brave attendance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And love to me, is the worldes posture right,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where one man's falling downe setts up another.</p>

My sorrowes are their triumphes; so in kings courts,</p>

<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                              Yes, it
Was once mine; and drawes teares from me to think
How 'twas forced from me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>.                    How many <emphasis>Spanyards</emphasis>
Killd you with that sword?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                    Had I killd one
This Barre had nere bene guilty of my pleading
Before such Princely Judges: there stands the man.</p>

Into a thousand pieces.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>.                 My Husband speaks untruth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Sett he on you first? more coward you to suffer an enemy be
aforehand.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Indeed in <emphasis>England</emphasis> my countrymen are good at bidding stand; but
I was not now upon a robbery but a defence, sett round with a thousand
dangers. He sett upon me; I had him at my feete, sav'd him, and for my
labour was after basely hurt by him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. This was examined by me, my Lords;
And <emphasis>Don John</emphasis>, thus accusd, was much ashamd
Of his unmanly dealing.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>.                  He may be now soe.</p>

<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. 40 peeces.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>. No, sir, but 38; see here, my Lord.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Right, no more then 38.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Your fort at <emphasis>Plymouth</emphasis> strong?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Yes, very strong.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. What Ordnance in't?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. 50 Peeces.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>. Oh fye, doe not belye your country; there's not so many.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. How many soldiers keepe you in that fort?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. 200.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Much about such a number.—There is a little iland before
<emphasis>Plymouth</emphasis>: What strength is that of?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. I doe not know.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>. We doe, then.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Is <emphasis>Plymouth</emphasis> a walld Towne?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Yes, it is walld.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. And a good wall?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. A very good strong wall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>. True tis a good strong wall, and built so high
One with a leape staffe may leape over it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Why did not your good navy, being in such bravery,
As it tooke <emphasis>Puntall</emphasis> seize <emphasis>Cales</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                              Our Generall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Might easily have tane it, for he had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Almost a thousand scaling ladders to sett up;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And without mayme to's army he might loose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A thousand men: but he was loath to robb</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An almes-house when he had a richer market</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To buy a conquest in.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>.                What was that market?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. <emphasis>Genoa or Lisbon</emphasis>: wherefore should we venture
Our lives to catch the wind, or to gett knockes
And nothing else.
                                [<emphasis>They consult</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. A poast with speed, to <emphasis>Lisbon</emphasis>,
And see't well mand.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>.               One shalbe sent, my Lord.</p>
<p>                            [<emphasis>Exit. The soldiers laugh</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. How now, why is this laughter?</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. One of the soldiers, being merry among themselves, is somewhat
bold with th'<emphasis>English</emphasis>, and sayes th'are dainty Hennes.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. [<emphasis>Alq</emphasis>.?] Hens! ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Sirra, view well these soldiers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And freely telle us, thinke you these will prove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Such hens as are your <emphasis>English</emphasis>, when next yeare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They land in your owne Country.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                         I thinke they will not,
My lord, prove hens, but somewhat neere to hens.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. How mean'st thou?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                  Let my speech breed no offence:
I thinke they would prove pulletts.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>.                              Dar'st thou fight
With any one of these our <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> pulletts?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. What heart have I to fight when tis beaten flatt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To earth with sad afflictions? can a prisoner</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Glory in playing the Fencer? my life's at stake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Allready; can I putt it in for more?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our army was some 14000 men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of which more than 12000 had spirits so high</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mine never shall come neere them: would some of them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were here to feed your expectations!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet, silly as I am, having faire pardon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From all your Graces and your Greatnesses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile try if I have strength in this chayned arme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To breake a rapier.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>.              Knock off all his gyves;
And he that has a stomacke for <emphasis>Spaines</emphasis> honour
To combate with this <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis>, appeare.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. May he be never calld an <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis>
That dares not looke a divell in the face,    [<emphasis>One stepps forth</emphasis>.
Come he in face of man, come how he can.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Your name?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tia</emphasis>. <emphasis>Tiago</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. Well done <emphasis>Tiago</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Let drums beate all the time they fight.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. I pray for thee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gent</emphasis>. And I.</p>
<p>      [<emphasis>They fight: Pike disarmes &amp; tripps him downe</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Onely a <emphasis>Devonshire</emphasis> hugg, sir:—at your feete
I lay my winnings.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tia</emphasis>. Diable!</p>
<p>    [<emphasis>Exit, biting his thumb[44]; the soldiers stampe</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>. Wilt venter on oanother?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                         I beseech you
To pardon me, and taske me to no more.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Come, come, one more; looke you, here's a young Cockerell[45]
Comes crowing into the pitt.
                                 [<emphasis>Another steps in</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>.                       Prithee, fight with him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. I'me in the Lyon's gripe &amp; to gett from him
There's but one way; that's death.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. <emphasis>English</emphasis>, What say you? will you fight or no?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Ile fight.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. Give 'em roome! make way there!</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Ile fight till every Joynt be cutt in pieces</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To please such brave spectators; yes Ile fight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While I can stand, be you but pleasd, my Lords,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The noble Dukes here, to allow me choice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of my owne Country weapon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. What?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. A Quarter staffe,—this, were the head off.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Off with the head, and roome!
How dost thou like this <emphasis>Spaniard</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                             Well: he's welcome.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here's my old trusty frend: are there no more?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One! what, but one? why, I shall make no play,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No sport before my princely Judges with one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More sackes to the Mill! come, another! what, no more?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. How many wouldst thou have?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Any number under six.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. Ha, ha, sure he's mad!</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Dar'st coape with Three?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Where are they? let 'em shew their faces: so; welcome!</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. How dost thou like these chickens?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                                   When I have drest them
With sorrell sopps Ile tell you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Now guard him heaven!</p>
<p>        [<emphasis>Drums. They fight, one is killd, the other 2 disarmed</emphasis>.</p>
<p>1. Hell take thy Quarter staffe!</p>
<p>2. Pox on thy quarters!</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. The matter? why this noyse?</p>
<p>                         [<emphasis>A noyse within of Diable Englese</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Jay</emphasis>. The soldiers rayle, stampe &amp; stare, and sweare to cutt
His throat for all the Jaylors care of him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Make proclamation, my lord <emphasis>Fernando</emphasis>,
That who soever dares but touch his finger
To hurt him, dyes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. I will, sir.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. This is done nobly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Here, give him this gold.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. The Duke <emphasis>Macada</emphasis> gives you this gold.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. And this.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. The Duke of <emphasis>Medina</emphasis> this; Duke <emphasis>Gyron</emphasis> this;
&amp;, looke you, the Marquesse <emphasis>Alqueveza</emphasis> as much as all the rest.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Where's any of my men? give him your Cloake, sirra;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fetch him cleane Band and Cuffs. I embrace thee, <emphasis>Pike</emphasis>;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hugg thee in my armes: scorne not to weare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> livery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.             Oh, my Lord, I am proud of't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. He shalbe with a Convoy sent to the King.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. 4 of my gentlemen shall along with him:
Ile beare thy charges, soldier, to <emphasis>Madrid</emphasis>,
5 peeces of 8 a day in travell, &amp;
Lying still thou shalt have halfe that.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>.                                 On my knees
Your vassaile thankes heaven, you, and these Princes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Breake up the Court till afternoon: then the 2 <emphasis>Guzmans</emphasis> tryall.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. Come, <emphasis>Englishman</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Med</emphasis>. How we honour valour thus our loves epresse:
Thou hast a guard of Dukes and Marquesses.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Teniente &amp; Henrico</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. The Lords are not yett risen: let us walke &amp; talke.
Were not you better yeild to marry her
Then yeild to suffer death? know you the law?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Law! yes; the spiders Cobweb[46], out of which great flyes breake
and in which the little are hangd: the Tarriers snaphance[47],
limetwiggs, weavers shuttle &amp; blankets in which fooles &amp; wrangling
coxcombes are tossd. Doe I know't now or not?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. If of the rape she accuse you 'tis in her choise
To have you marry her or to have you hangd[48].</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Hangd, hangd by any meanes! marry her? had I
The King of <emphasis>Spaines</emphasis> 7 Kingdomes,
<emphasis>Gallicia, Navarre</emphasis>, the 2 <emphasis>Castiles,
Leon, Arragon, Valentia, Granada</emphasis>,
And <emphasis>Portugall</emphasis> to make up 8, Ide lose them
All to be rid of such a piece of flesh.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. How? such a piece of flesh? Why, she has limbes
Mad out of wax.[49]</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.          Then have her to some faire
And shew her for money.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>.                  Is she not sweet complexiond?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. As most Ladyes are that studye painting.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. What meate will downe your throat, when you scorne pheasant,
partridge, woodcocke &amp; coney? Would I had such a dish.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Woodcocke and coney take to you, my <emphasis>Don Teniente</emphasis>; Ile none; and
because you keepe such a wondering why my stomach goes against the wench
(albeit I might find better talke, considering what ladder I stand upon)
Ile tell you, signior, what kind of wife I must have or none.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. Pray let me see her picture.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                              Draw then this curtaine:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Give me a wife that's sound of wind and limbe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose teeth can tell her age; whose hand nere felt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A touch lascivious; whose eyes are balls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not tossd by her to any but to me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose breath stinkes not of sweatmeates; whose lippes kisse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Onely themselves and mine; whose tongue nere lay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At the signe of the <emphasis>Bell</emphasis>. She must not be a scold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No, nor a foole to be in love with Bables[50];</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No, nor too wise to think I nere saile true</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But when she steares the rudder. I'de not have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her belly a drum, such as they weave points on,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unles they be taggd with vertue; nor would I have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her white round breasts 2 sucking bottles to nurse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Any Bastards at them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>.                I believe you would not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. I would not have her tall, because I love not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To dance about a May pole; nor too lowe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Litle clocks goe seldome true); nor, sir, too fatt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Slug[51] shipps can keepe no pace); no, nor too leane,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To read Anatomy lectures ore her Carcas.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor would I have my wife exceeding faire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For then she's liquorish meate; &amp; it would mad me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To see whoremasters teeth water at her,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Red haird by no meanes, though she would yeild money</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sell her to some Jew for poyson. No,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My wife shall be a globe terrestriall,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Moving upon no axeltree but mine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which globe when I turne round, what land soever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I touch, my wife is with me, still Ime at home.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. But where will you find such a wife on earth?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. No, such a wife in the Moone for me doth tarry:
If none such shine here I with none will marry.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ten</emphasis>. The Lordes are come.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. I care neyther for Lords nor Ladies.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter the Nobles as before; Fernando, Manuell, Clarke, Jaylor</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Where are these gentlemen? sett 'em both to a Barre</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And opposite, face to face: a Confrontation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May perhaps daunt th'offender &amp; draw from him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More then he'de utter. You accuse your Brother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As murtherer of your father: where's the proofe?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. First call my fathers man in.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clark</emphasis>. What's his name?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clark</emphasis>. Call <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis> in!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. Here I am, here.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clark</emphasis>. Stand out: whither goe you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. To stand out.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clark</emphasis>. Stand there.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Now what can he say?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. First, my Lord, heare mee:
My brother &amp; I lying in one bed together,
And he just under us—</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. In my fleabitten Trundle bed.[52]</p>
<p><emphasis>Clark</emphasis>. Peace, sirra.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. About midnight I awaking,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this <emphasis>Buzzano</emphasis> too, my brother in his sleepe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus cryde out, "Oh, twas I that murtherd him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This hand that killd him"!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>. Heard you this, sirra?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. As sure as I heare you now.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. And you'le be sworne 'twas he that so cryde out?</p>
<p><emphasis>Buz</emphasis>. If I were going to be hangd Ide sweare.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clark</emphasis>. Forbeare the Court.
                                  [<emphasis>Exit Buzzano</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. All this is but presumption: if this be all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The shott you make against him your bullets stick</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In a mud wall, or if they meete resistance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They backe rebound &amp; fly in your owne face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Med</emphasis>. Bring your best forces up, for these are weak ones.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Then here I throw my glove &amp; challenge him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To make this good upon him: that at comming home</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He first told me my father dyed in France,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then some hours after that he was not dead</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But that he left him in <emphasis>Lorraine</emphasis> at <emphasis>Nancy</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then at <emphasis>Chaalons</emphasis> in <emphasis>Burgundy</emphasis>, &amp; lastly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He said to <emphasis>Don Fernando</emphasis> he was in <emphasis>Paris</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. He did indeed.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. What then?</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Then, when in's chamber we were going to bed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He suddenly lookd wild, catchd me by the hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, falling on his knees, with a pale face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And troubled conscience he confessed he killd him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, swore he basely murtherd him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. What say you to this?</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Now he comes close up to you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. He is my murtherer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I am none, so lett my Innocence guard me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I never spake with a distracted voice;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nere fell to him on my knees; spake of no father,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No murtherd father. He's alive as I am,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And some foule divell stands at the fellowes elbow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Jogging him to this mischefe. The Villaine belyes me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And on my knees, my lord, I beg that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And my white Innocence may tread the path</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beaten out before us by that man, my brother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Command a case of rapiers to be sent for,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lett me meete his daring. I know him valiant;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I am doubly armd, both with a Courage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fiery as his can be, and with a cause</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That spitts his accusation full in the face.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. The combate in this case cannot be granted,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And here's the reason: when a man accuses</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A frend, much more a brother, for a fact</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So foule as murther (murther of a father),</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Law leapes straight way to the Challenger</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To take his part. Say he that doth accuse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should be decrepitt, lame and weake, or sickly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The other strong and lusty; thinke you a kingdome</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will hazard so a subject, when the quarrell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is for a kingdomes right? If y'are so valiant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You then must call the law into the field</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But not the man.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>.           I have done; let law proceed.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. This cannot serve your turne, say he does belye you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He stakes against your body his owne soule.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Say there is no such murther, yet the Law</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fastens on you; for any man accusd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For killing of his father may be rackd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To draw confession from him. Will you confesse?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. I cannot, must not, will not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Jaylour, take &amp; prepare him for the racke:
Wele see it done here.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. You are righteous Judges.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Oh villaine, villaine, villaine!</p>
<p>                      [<emphasis>Exit with the Jaylour</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Med</emphasis>. Where's the wrongd Lady?</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Stand you still at the Barre.
You are now another man, sir; your scale turnes.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Fernando fetches in Eleonora</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Looke on the prisoner: doe you know him, Lady?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. Would I had nere had cause to say I know him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Of what doe you accuse him?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>.                             As the murtherer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Both of my name and honour. In the hurry,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When the Citty (they said) was ready to be taken,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I being betrothed to this young gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My father brought me to his father's house,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Telling me their dwelt safety.—There dwelt villany,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Treason, lust, basenes! for this godlesse man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(The storme being ore) came in &amp; forcd from me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Jewell of my virgin honour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>.                          False!</p>
<p><emphasis>Fer</emphasis>. I would not have thee thinke (thou graceles wretch)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She, being contracted to thee, loving thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Loving thee far more dearly then her selfe,</p>

And bring a scandall on my house &amp; me,</p>

Were not the fact most true.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Most false by all that ever man can sweare by.
We falling out, I told her once I nere
Would marry her; &amp; soe she workes this mischiefe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Gyr</emphasis>. You here stand chargd for ravishing her, &amp; you
Must marry her or she may have your life.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Lady, what say you? which had you rather have,
His life or him?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ele</emphasis>. I am not cruell; pay me my first Bond
Of marriage, which you seald to, &amp; I free you
And shall with Joy run flying to your armes.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. Law you?[53]</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. That's easy enough.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. Rackes, Gibbetts, wheeles make sausages of my flesh first!
Ile be ty'd to no man's Strumpet.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. Then you muste look to dye.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Lady, withdraw.</p>

<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Pray, give me privacy a little with my brother.</p>
<p><emphasis>All</emphasis>. [<emphasis>Alq</emphasis>.?] Take it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. O brother your owne Conscience knowes you wrong me:</p>

Ile rather suffer on the Gallow Tree</p>

<p>

Then thus be torne in pieces. Canst thou see mee</p>

For heavens sake, for thine owne sake pitty mee.</p>

In my eare he confesses all again and prayes me
To speake to you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Will you openly confesse?</p>
<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. No, no, I cannot. Caytiffe, I spake not soe:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I must not wound my Conscience to lay on it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A guilt it knowes not. Ile not so dishonour</p>
<empty-line/>

I doe confesse the murther; I killd my father.</p>

<p><emphasis>Man</emphasis>. Neere <emphasis>St. Germains</emphasis>
In <emphasis>Paris</emphasis>, in a darke night, &amp; then I fled.</p>

<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Did you see't, sirra?</p>

her cry out "helpe! helpe!" &amp; the Gamboll being ended she came in like
a mad woman, ruffled &amp; crumpled, her haire about her eares; &amp; he all
unbrac'd, sweating as if he had bene thrashing; &amp; afterwards he told me,
my lords, that he had downe diddled her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hen</emphasis>. I now am lost indeed, &amp; on my knee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beg pardon of that goodnes, that pure Temple</p>

And courted him to kisse it; therefore now
Ile have his life.</p>

You both must die next morning.</p>

You would have savd him, then you made your choyce</p>

To marry him: will you then kill your husband?</p>

Why, then, because the Law makes me his Judge,</p>

That though your Nation came in Thunder hither
Yet he holds out to you his Enemy
2 friendly proffers: serve him in his dominions
Eyther by land or sea, &amp; thou shalt live
Upon a golden pension, such a harvest

There is another obligation,</p>

A hundred pistoletts to beare you home.</p>

Which from the <emphasis>Lady Marquesse Alquevezze</emphasis></p>

<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. What did she to thee?</p>

<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. Rarely; it is a brave, bounteous, munificent, magnificent
Marquezza! the great Turke cannot tast better meat then I have eaten
at this ladies Table.</p>
<p><emphasis>Alq</emphasis>. So, so.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. And for a lodging, if the curtaines about my bed had bene cutt
of Sunbeames, I could not lye in a more glorious Chamber.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. You have something, then, to speake of our weomen when y'are in
<emphasis>England</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pike</emphasis>. This Box, with a gold chaine in't for my Wife &amp; some pretty
things for my Children, given me by your honourd Lady would else cry
out on me. There's a <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> shirt, richly lacd &amp; seemd, her guift
too; &amp; whosoever layes a foul hand upon her linnen in scorne of her
bounty, were as good flea[54] the Divells skin over his eares.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mac</emphasis>. Well said: in <emphasis>England</emphasis> thou wilt drinke her health?</p>

But now to cutt you off.</p>

But on my knees I beg this marginall note</p>
<empty-line/>

May sticke upon the paper; that no guilt,</p>

But feare of Tortures frighted me to take</p>

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO <emphasis>THE LADY MOTHER</emphasis>.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The authorship of this anonymous play, now printed for the first time
(from Eg. MS. 1994), is not difficult to discover. Any one who has had
the patience to read the Plays of Henry Glapthorne cannot fail to be
amused by the bland persistence with which certain passages are
reproduced in one play after another. Glapthorne's stock of fancies was
not very extensive, but he puts himself to considerable pains to make
the most of them. In <emphasis>The Lady Mother</emphasis> we find the same ornaments spread
out before us, many of them very tawdry at their best. Glapthorne's
editor has striven to show that the weak-kneed playwright was a
fellow-pupil of John Milton's at St. Paul's. One cannot think of the two
names together without calling to mind the "lean and flashy songs" and
"scrannel pipes of wretched straw" in <emphasis>Lycidas</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Yet Glapthorne was a man of some parts. He had little enough dramatic
power, but he writes occasionally with tenderness and feeling. In his
poetical garden rank weeds choke up the flower-beds; but still, if we
have patience to pursue the quest, we may pick here and there a
musk-rose or a violet that retains its fragrance. He seems to have taken
Shirley as his master; but desire in the pupil's case outran
performance. It is, indeed, a pitiful fall from the <emphasis>Grateful Servant</emphasis>,
a honey-sweet old play, fresh as an idyl of Theocritus, to the paltry
faded graces of the <emphasis>Lady's Privilege</emphasis>.</p>
<p>A note at the end of <emphasis>The Lady Mother</emphasis> in the hand-writing of William
Blagrave, acting for the Master of the Revels, shows that the play was
licensed in October, 1635. From a passage in II., 1, it would seem to
have been produced at the Salisbury Court Theatre in Whitefriars. In the
same year Glapthorne's comedy of the <emphasis>Hollander</emphasis>, according to the
title-page, was being acted at the Cockpit, Drury Lane. His other pieces
were produced rather later. I am inclined to think that <emphasis>The Lady
Mother</emphasis>, in spite of the wild improbability of the plot and the poorness
of much of the comic parts, is our author's best work. In such lines as
the following (IV., 1) there is a little flickering of pathos:—</p>
<p>    "Enough, good friend; no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Had a rude <emphasis>Scythian</emphasis>, ignorant of tears,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Unless the wind enforced them from his eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Heard this relation, sure he would have wept;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And yet I cannot. I have lost all sense</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of pitty with my womanhood, and now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That once essentiall Mistress of my soule,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Warme charity, no more inflames my brest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then does the glowewormes uneffectuall fire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The ha[n]d that touches it. Good sir, desist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The agravation of your sad report;    [<emphasis>Weepe</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ive to much griefe already."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The "glowewormes uneffectuall fire" is of course pilfered from Hamlet,
but it is happily introduced. There is some humour in the scene (I., 2)
where the old buck, Sir Geoffrey, who is studying a compliment to his
mistress while his hair is being trimmed by his servant before the glass,
puts by the importunity of his scatter-brain'd nephew and the blustering
captain, who vainly endeavour to bring him to the point and make him
disburse. On the whole I am confident that <emphasis>The Lady Mother</emphasis> will be
found less tedious than any other of Glapthorne's pieces.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Thorowgood, Bonvill &amp; Grimes</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. What? will it be a match man?
Shall I kneele to thee and aske thee blessing, ha?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Pish! I begin to feare her, she does
Dally with her affection: I admire itt.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Shee and her daughters</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Created were for admiration only,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And did my Mistress and her sister not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Obscure their mothers luster fancy could not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Admitt a fuller bewty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Tis easier to expresse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where nimble winds lodge, ore investigate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An eagles passage through the agill ayre</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then to invent a paraphrase to expresse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How much true virtue is indebted to their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unparaleld perfections.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Nay[56], but shall I not be acquainted with your designe? when we
must marry, faith to save charges of two wedding dinners, lets cast so
that one day may yeild us bridegroome,—I to the daughter and thou to
the mother.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. She falls off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With such a soddaine ambiguitie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the strong heate of her profesd[57] love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I conceive she intends a regular proofe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of my untainted Faith.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Soe I thinke, too: when I was young the plaine downe-right way
serv'd to woe and win a wench; but now woing is gotten, as all things
else are, into the fashion; gallantts now court their Mistress with
mumps &amp; mows as apes and monke[y]s doe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. But cannot all your fluent witt interpret</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why she procastinatts your promisd match?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By this light, her daughter would be married tomorrow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If her mother and I had concluded on the Joynture.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. The most evident reason she will give me of this unwellcome
protraccon is she has some new employment to put on me, which performd
she has ingaged her selfe to certainty of her designing me an answerare
[<emphasis>sic</emphasis>].</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Lovell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Here comes your Rivall, Mr. <emphasis>Thorowgood</emphasis>,—<emphasis>Alexander</emphasis> the
<emphasis>Great</emphasis>, her Ladishipps loving Steward.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. But does he affect the lady; what's his character?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. He was by trade a taylor, sir, and is the tenth part of the
bumbast that goes to the setting forth of a man: his dealing consists
not much in weight but in the weight of his pressing Iron, under whose
tyranny you shall perceave no small shrinking.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Well said, <emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. On!</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. He has alterd himselfe out of his owne cutt since he was
steward; yet, if you saw him in my ladyes Chamber you would take him
for some usher of a dancing schoole, as being aptest in sight for a
crosse cap.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Excellent <emphasis>Grimes</emphasis> still!</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. By his cloathes you might deeme him a knight; but yet if you
uncase him, you will find his sattin dublett naught but fore sleaves &amp;
brest, the back part buckram; his cloake and cape of two sorts; his
roses and garters of my ladyes old Cypres: to conclude, sir, he is an
ambodexter or a Jack-of-all-sides &amp; will needs mend that which Nature
made: he takes much upon him since the old Knight dyed, and does fully
intend to run to hell[58] for the lady: he hates all wines and strong
drinks—mary, tis but in publique, for in private he will be drunke, no
tinker like him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Peace, sirrah; observe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. So, let me see the <emphasis>summa totalis</emphasis> of my sweet ladies
perfections.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Good, he has her in whole already.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Peace, <emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. <emphasis>Imprimis, her faire haire; no silken sleave</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Can be so soft the gentle worm does weave.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

It[em], noe Plush or satten sleeke, I vow,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

May be compard unto her velvet brow.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

It[em], her eyes—two buttons made of iett;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Her lipps gumd taffety that will not frett;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Her cheeks are changeable, as I suppose,—</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Carnation and white, lyllie and rose</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. I, there it goes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. I protest I comend him; he goes through stitch with her like
the Master of his trade.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. <emphasis>It[em] her brests two bottomes[59] be of thred,
By which love to his laborinth is led.
Her belly</emphasis>—</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. I, marry, sir, now he comes to the purpose.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. <emphasis>Her Belly a soft Cushion where no sinner
But her true love must dare stick a pin in her</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. That line has got the prick and prayse from all the rest.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. <emphasis>Butt to that stuff of stuffs, that without scoff
Is Camills haire or else stand further off</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. How many shreads has he stoale here to patch up this lady?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. <emphasis>The totall some of my blest deity
Is the magazine of Natures treasury</emphasis>.—
Soe, this made up, will I take an occasion to dropp where she may find
it. But, stay; here's company.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Mr. <emphasis>Lovell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. And see, I shall divulge myselfe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. A foole, I doubt not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Is your lady stirring?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. She is risen, sir, and early occupied in her occasions spiritual,
and domesticke busines.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Lady &amp; Magdalen</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Sweet Mr. <emphasis>Bonvil</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The simple entertain[m]ent you receave here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I feare will scare you from us: you're so early</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Up, you do not sleepe well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I cannot looke on her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Ime as violent as a high-wrought sea</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In my desires; a fury through my eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At every glance of hers invades my heart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. What ayles you, servant? are you not well?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. 'Tis his humour, Madam; he is accustomed, though it be in
company, to hold a dialogue with his thoughts. Please you, lady, to
give his fever libertie; the fit will soon be overpasd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. She bears her age well, or she is not sped</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Far into th'vale of yeares: she has an eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Piercing as is an Eglets when her damme,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Training[60] her out into the serene air,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Teaches her face the Sunbeames.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Madam, I fear my friend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath falne againe in love; he practises</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To himself new speeches; you and he are not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Broke off, I hope.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. O, sir, I value my servant at a higher rate:
We two must not easily disagree.
Sir <emphasis>Alexander</emphasis>, attend in Mr. <emphasis>Bonvill</emphasis>.
My daughter's up by this time, and I would have him give her the first
salute. You had best be wary, <emphasis>Bonvill</emphasis>; the young cittizen or the
souldier will rob you of her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. O, we feare not them: shall we goe, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Nay, Ile detaine my servant.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Harke you, sir, strike home; doe you heare?</p>
<p>          [<emphasis>Exeunt Bonvill, Grimes, Lovell &amp; Mag</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Servant, have you leasure
To hear what I inioyne you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Your good pleasure.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. What shall I doe? I can no longer beare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This flame so mortall; I have wearid heaven</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With my entreaties and shed teares enough</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To extinguish <emphasis>Aetna</emphasis>, but, like water cast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On coales, they ad unto my former heate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A more outragious fervor. I have tried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All modest meanes to give him notice of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My violent love, but he, more dull then earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Either conceives them not or else, possessd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With full affection of my daughter, scornes me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Madam, wilt please you to deliver your pleasure?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. <emphasis>Thorowgood</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not clouds of lightning, or the raging bolt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heavens anger darts at the offending world,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can with such horrid rigor peirce the earth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As these sad words I must demonstrate to you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doe my afflicted brest.—Ime lost; my tongue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I would speake, like to an Isicle</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Disturbd by motion of unruly winds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shakes to pronounce't, yet freezes to my roofe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Faster by th'agitation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Your full Judgment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could not have found an apter instrument</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For the performance of what you designe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then I experience how much any man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May become passive in obedience</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To the intent of woman, in my truth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Set the abstrusest comment on my faith</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Imagination can resolve, my study</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall mak't as easie as the plainest lines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which hearty lovers write.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Timothy</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tim</emphasis>. Madam, this letter and his humble vowes
From your deserving sonn.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. He writes me here he will be here tomorrow.
Where left you him?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tim</emphasis>. At your right worthy Cosens.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. What manner of man is this Mr. <emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>
He brings with him?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tim</emphasis>. A most accomplishd gentleman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. 'Tis well: Mr. <emphasis>Thoroegood</emphasis>,
Weele walke into the Gallery, and there
Discourse the rest.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I long till I receive the audience of it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tim</emphasis>. Your ladiship will vouchsafe to meete
The Gent[lemen] in your Coach some two miles hence?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Ile thinke of it.</p>
<p>                                   [<emphasis>Exeunt omnes</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>(SCENE 2.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    _Enter Sucket and Crackby[61].</p>
<p>Suc_. Come, deport your selfe with a more elated countenance: a
personage of your rare endowments so dejected! 'tis fitt for groomes,
not men magnanimous, to be so bashfull: speake boldly to them, that like
cannon shott your breath may batter; you would hardly dare to take in
townes and expugne fortresses, that cannot demolish a paltry woman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Pox of this Country, it has metamorphisd me. Would I were in my
native Citty ayre agen, within the wholesome smell of seacole: the
vapor[s] rising from the lands new dunged are more infectious to me then
the common sewer ith sicknes time. Ime certaine of my selfe Ime impudent
enough and can dissemble as well as ere my Father did to gett his
wealth, but this country has tane my edge of quite; but I begin to sound
the reason of it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. What may it be imagind.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Why, here are no Taverns where for my crowne I can have food
provocative, besides the gaining of many precious phrase[s] for (from?)
divers gallants new frenchefied. Theirs nothing to excite desire but
creame and eggs, and they are so common every clowne devoures them. Were
each egge at twelve pence, or as deare as lobsters, I could afford to
eate them, but I hate all that is vulgar; 'tis most base.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. Pish, tis dificience in your resolution:
Suppose your mistress were an enemy
You were to encounter in sterne duell.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. 'Tis well my Enemie is a woman; I should feare else to suppose
the meeting. Resolution! how can a man have resolution that drinkes
nought but ale able to kill a Dutchman? Conduit water is nector to it,</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. Nay, but I say, suppose—</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Suppose! Why here are no wenches halfe so amorous as Citty
tripennies[62]: those that are bewtifull the dew is not so cold. I did
but begg a curtesie of a chambermaide, and she laughd at me! Ile to the
Citty againe, that's certaine; where for my angell I can imbrace
pl[enty]. If I stay here a little longer, for want of exercise I shall
forget whether a woman be fish or flesh: I have almost don't already.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. O, heeres your uncle, move him; you conceive me;
He must disburse.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. And 'tis as hard to wrest a penny from him as from a bawd.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Gefferie and Bunche</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Erect that locke a little; theres a hayre</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which, like a foreman of a shop, does strive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be above his fellowes. Pish! this glasse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is falsly silverd, maks me look as gray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As if I were 4 score.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bun</emphasis>. What does he want of it?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Combe with more circumspection, knave; these perfumes
Have a dull odor; there is meale among them,
My Mrs. will not scent them.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Uncle, my friend,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My martiall fellow is deficient</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In this ubiquitarie mettall, silver:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You must impart.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. This garter is not well tide, fellow: where</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wert thou brought up? thou knowest not to tie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A rose yet, knave: a little straiter: so,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now, tis indifferent. Who can say that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Am old now?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bun</emphasis>. Marry, that can I or any one which sees you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. Death to my reputation!
Sir, we are gent[lemen] and deserve regard:
Will you not be responsible?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Alas, good Captaine, I was meditating how to salute my lady
this morning. You have bin a traviler: had I best do it in the <emphasis>Italian</emphasis>
garbe or with a <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> gravity? your <emphasis>French</emphasis> mode is grown so common
every vintners boy has it as perfect as his <emphasis>anon, anon, sir</emphasis>. Hum, I
must consider on it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Nay, but uncle, uncle, shall we have answeare concerning this
mony, uncle? You must disburse; that is the souldiers phrase. You see
this man; regard him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. Death of vallor! I can hold no longer; I shall rise in wroth
against him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Dee heare, Uncle? you must furnish him; he wilbe irefull
presently, and then a whole bagg will not satisfie him; heele eate your
gold in anger and drinke silver in great sack glasses.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Pox o'this Congee; 't shalbe thus, no thus;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That writhing of my body does become me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Infinitly. Now to begett an active</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Complement that, like a matins sung</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By virgins, may enchant her amorous ear.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>Spanish Basolas[63] manos</emphasis> sounds, methinks,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As harsh as a Morisco kettledrum;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The <emphasis>French boniour</emphasis> is ordinary as their</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Disease: hees not a gent that cannot parlee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I must invent some new and polite phrases.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Shall I have answeare yet, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Pish, you disturbe me.—Gratulate her rest,
Force an encomium on her huswifry
For being up so early.—<emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>, where is my nephew?</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. I have bin here this halfe hower and could not get answere.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>, To what, good nephew?—I was meditating a little seriously.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Concerning this white earth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Youde know the nature of it? If it be marle 'tis good to
manure land; if clay, to make tobacco pipes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. I meane mony.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. O mony, Nephew: Ide thought youde learnd ith Citty
How to use mony: here we do imploy it
To purchase land and other necessaries.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. Infamy to fame and noble reputation!
Old man, dost thou disdaine valour? I tell thee, Catterpillar,
I must have mony.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. 'Tis reason good you should; it is fitting to cherish men
of armes. There is a treasurer in the county, Captaine, pays souldiers
pensions: if any be due to you Ile write my letter, you shall receive
it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bun</emphasis>. Faith, there he mett with you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. I see a storme a coming. Uncle, I wilbe answerable upon account:
my souldier must have mettall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Iron and Steele is most convenient for Souldiers; but, since
you say it, Nephew, he shall have it: how much must it be?</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. A score of Angells shall satisfie for the confrontment you have
offred me in being dilatory.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. <emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>, deliver him ten pounds;—but, dee heare.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>, let be in light gold; 'twill serve his turn as well as heavier:
it may be he is one of those projectors transports it beyond sea.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Magdalen</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mag</emphasis>. Sir, I come to give you notice my ladyes walkd into the garden.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Life! is she upp so early?</p>
<p><emphasis>Mag</emphasis>. An hower since, beleeve it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Is my Mistress stirring?</p>
<p><emphasis>Mag</emphasis>. In truth, I know not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Nephew, demeane your selfe with[64] all respect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Toward the gentlewoman you affect.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You must learne with here since the citty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could spare you none.—Ile to the lady.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                         [<emphasis>Exeunt Bunch, Sir Geff. and Mag</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Captaine, shalls into th'Celler, Captaine?</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. I like the Motion.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Come away, then: there is indifferent liquor in this house,
but that ith towne is most abominable. Weele drinke our owne healths,
Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. Well considered; 'tis for our reputation.</p>
<p>                                 [<emphasis>Exeunt omnes</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>(SCENE 3.)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Bonvill, Clarinna, Belizea and Grimes</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Come, you are wantons both: If I were absent,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You would with as much willingness traduce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My manners to them. What Idiots are wee men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To tender our services to women</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who deride us for our paines!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Why can you great wise men who esteeme us women</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But equall with our parrets or at best</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But a degree above them, prating creatures</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Devoid of reason, thinke that when we see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A man whose teeth will scarce permitt his tongue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To say,—(he is soe like December come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A woing to the Spring, with all the ensignes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of youth and bravery as if he meant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To dare his land-lord Death to single rapier)—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have not so much spleene as will engender</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A modest laughter at him?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Nay, theres his Nephew, <emphasis>Crackby</emphasis>, your sweet servant.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clar</emphasis>. My Servant! I do admire that man's impudence,
How he dare speake to any woman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Why, is he not flesh and blood?</p>
<p><emphasis>Clar</emphasis>. Yes, but I question whether it be mans or no.
They talk of changlings: if there be such things
I doubt not but hees one of them.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Fie,[65] Sister; 'tis a prettye gent, I know you love him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clar</emphasis>. You hitt it there, I faith,[66]—You know the man?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Yes, very well.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clar</emphasis>. Have you then ever seene such another monster?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was begott surely in the wane of the moone,</p>
<empty-line/>

When Natures tooles were at laime Vulcans forge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A sharpning, that she was forced to shake this lumpe together.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. What man for heavens sake could your nicenes fancy?</p>
<p><emphasis>Clar</emphasis>. Not you of all that ever I beheld.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. And why, good wisdome?</p>
<p><emphasis>Clar</emphasis>. Nay, do not scratch me because he is your choyse, forsooth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Well, we shall see the goodly youth your curiositie has elected,
when my brother returnes, I hope.</p>
<p><emphasis>Clar</emphasis>. I hope soe, too; I marvill where this Cub is,
He is not roaring here yet.</p>

And to our chambers.

Ere I begin my story I would wish you</p>

Invoake your patience, all thats man about you</p>

The newes I bring will like a palsie shake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your soules indifferenst temper.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Prethee, what is't which on the soddaine can
Be thus disastrous? 'tis beyond my thoughts.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Nay, slight it not: the dismall ravens noate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or mandrakes screches, to a long-sick man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is not so ominous as the heareing of it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will be to you; 'twill like a frost congeale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your lively heate,—yet it must out, our frendship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forbids concealment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Do not torture me;
Ime resolute to heare it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Your soe admired Mistress
Who parted from you now, <emphasis>Belisea</emphasis>,—</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. You have don well before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your sad relation to repeat that sound;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That holy name whose fervor does excite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A fire within mee sacred as the flame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

As if it meant to combat with the sunn</p>

<p>

For heats priority! Ime arm'd gainst death,</p>

Could thy words blow it on me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Here me, then:
Your Mistress—</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. The Epitome of virtues,
Who like the pretious reliques of a Saint
Ought only to be seene, not touchd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Yet heare me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cease your immoderate prayses: I must tell you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You doe adore an Idoll; her black Soule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is tainted as an Apple which the Sunn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Has kist to putrifaction; she is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Her proper appelation sounds so foule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I quake to speake it) a corrupted peice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A most lascivious prostitute.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Howes this?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Speake it agen, that if the sacrilege</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou'st made gainst vertue be but yet sufficient</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To yeild thee dead, the iteration of it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May damne thee past the reach of mearcye. Speake it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While thou hast utterance left; but I conceit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A lie soe monstrous cannot chuse but choake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The vocall powers, or like a canker rott</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy tung in the delivery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Sir, your rage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cannot inforce a recantacion from me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I doe pronounce her light as is a leafe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In withered Autumne shaken from the trees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By the rude winds: noe specld serpent weares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More spotts than her pide honor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. So, no more:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy former words incenst me but to rage;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These to a fury which noe sea of teares,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though shed by queenes or Orphants, shall extinguish;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay, should my mother rise from her cold urne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And weepe herself to death againe to save</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thee from perdition, 't should not; were there placd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Twixt thee and mee a host of blasing starrs,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thus I would through them to thee!    [_Draw.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Tho_. Had I knowne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your passion would have vanquishd reason thus,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You should have met your ruine unadvisd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hugd your destruction; taken what the lust</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of other men had left you. But the name</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And soule of friendship twixt us I had thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would have retain'd this most unmanly rage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gainst me, for declaration of a truth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By which you might be ransomed from the armes</p>
<empty-line/>

Of her adulterate honor.</p>

Into the ocean and obtaind a pearle,</p>

<p>

To make me creditt my <emphasis>Belissia</emphasis> false.    [<emphasis>Kneele</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forgive me, holy love, that I delay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So long to scourge the more than heathnish wrongs</p>

<p>

Of this iniurious villaine, whome me thinks—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Blow him hence to hell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With his contagious slander! yet before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou doest fall by me as, if heaven have not</p>

Lost all its care of Innocence, thou must doe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tell me what Divell urgd thee to detract</p>

From virtue thus, for of thy selfe thou couldst not</p>

Without some information: whoes the Author</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of this prodigious calumnie?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Her mother.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Ha! her mother?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Yes, she; that certaine Oracle of truth,</p>

<p>

That pretious mine of honor, which before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She would exhaust, or yeild your innocence</p>

A spoyle to vice, chose rather to declare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her daughter's folly; and with powerfull teares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Besought me, by the love I bore to goodnes,</p>

Which in her estimation had a roome</p>

Higher than Nature, to reveale it to you</p>

And disingage you from her.</p>

In the defence of women; who,[67] but that</p>

The mothers virtues stands betweene heavens Justice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would for the daughters unexampled sinne</p>
<empty-line/>

Be by some soddaine Judgment swept from earth</p>

As creatures too infectious. Gentle freind,</p>

In <emphasis>Lethe</emphasis>, seases on me and I feare</p>

My passion will inforce me to transgresse</p>

Young <emphasis>Crackby</emphasis> and his friend are newly up</p>

And have bin with us. My sister has had</p>

The modest bout with them: 'tis such a wench.</p>

<p>

Are you a sleepe? why doe you not looke up?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What muse you on?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Faith, I was thinking where
In the whole world to find an honest woman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. An excellent meditation! What doe you take me for, my Mother
and my Sister?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. You alway excepted; tis but melancholly;
Prethee bestow a kisse upon me, love;
Perchance that will expell it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. If your cure be wrought soe easily, pittie you should perish
for want of physick.    [<emphasis>Kiss him</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. She kisses as sheed wont; were she unchast,</p>

Surely her breath would like a <emphasis>Stigian</emphasis> mist</p>

Or some contagious vapor blast me; but</p>

'Tis sweet as <emphasis>Indian</emphasis> balme, and from her lips</p>

That such a goodly building as this same
Should have such vild stuff in itt.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. What meanes this language?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Nothing, but only to informe you what
You know to well alreadie: <emphasis>Belisia</emphasis>, you are
—(I cannot call her whore)—a perjurd woman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Defend me innocence! I scarce remember
That ever I made oath and therefore wonder
How I should breake on.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Have you not with imprecations beg'd
Heavens vengeance if you ere lovd man but me?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. And those same heavens are vouchers[69]
I've kept my vowes with that strict purity
That I have done my honor.</p>

So infinitly worthles that you thought</p>

The fragments of thy honour good enough</p>
<empty-line/>

To sate my appetite, what other men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had with unhallowd hands prophaind? O woman,</p>

<p>

Once I had lockd in thy deceiving brest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A treasure wealthier then the <emphasis>Indies</emphasis> both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can in their glory boast, my faithfull heart,</p>

<p>

Which I do justly ravish back from it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since thou art turnd a strumpet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Doe you thinke
I am what you have term'd me?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Doe I thinke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When I behold the wanton Sparrows change</p>
<empty-line/>

Their chirps to billing, they are chast? or see</p>

From wild concupiscence? I prithee tell me,</p>

<p>

Does not the genius of thy honor dead</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Haunt thee with apparitions like a goast</p>

<p>

Of one thou'dst murdrd? dost not often come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To thy bed-side and like a fairy pinch</p>

Thy prostituted limbs, then laughing tell thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis in revenge for myriads of black tortures</p>

Thy lust inflicted on it?</p>

Give me a little leave then ere my greife</p>

and to be druncke in publicke, I say and I sayt, were to give ill
examples. Goe to, I, and goe to; tis good to be merry and wise; an inch
in quietness is better than an ell of sorrow. Goe to and goe to agen,
for I say and I sayt, there is no reason but that the parson may forget
that ere he was clerke[71]. My lady has got a cast of her eye since she
tooke a survey of my good parts. Goe to and goe to, for I say and I
sayt, they are signes of a rising; flesh is frayle and women are but
women, more then men but men. I am puft up like a bladder, sweld with
the wind[72] of love; for go to and go to, I say and I sayt, this love
is a greife, and greife a sorrowe, and sorrows dry. Therefore come
forth, thou bottle of affection[73]; I create thee my companion, and
thou, cup, shalt be my freind. Why, so now,—goe to and goe to: lets
have a health to our Mrss, and first to myne; sweet companion, fill to

to my Mrs! Soe, now my hands in: companion, fill, and heres a health to
my freinds Mrs. Very good, and now I will conclude with yours, my deare
companion: stay, you shall pledge me presently, tis yet in a good hand;
I will pledge both your Mrss first. Goe to and go to,[74] freind; thou
alwayes lookst on me like a dry rascall; give him his liquor; and soe
with my Mrs I conclude. What say you, Companion? ha, do you compare
your Mrs with myne? howes that? such another word and thou darst,
Sirrah! off with your Capp and doe her Reverence! wilt tell me soe? goe
to, I say and I sayt; Ile make better languadge come out of that mouth
of thine, thou wicked Carkasse. Freind, heres to thee:[75] Ile shake
thee, thou empty Rascall, to peeces, and as <emphasis>Hector</emphasis> drew <emphasis>Achilles</emphasis>
bout the walls of Troy at his horse tayle, so shalt thou at a doggs
tayle be dragd in vild disgrace throughout the towne. Goe to and goe to,
I say and I sayt; Ile have the dragd, sirr, ah I[le] have the dragd;
perswade me not, good friend; let him yeild me a reason[76] if he can.
I, I, he had need to be squeezd; why tis true, this is one, but not to
purpose. Oh, would you whisper with me? umh, umh, umh, away, Ile heare
no more: why, how now frend? ha, ha, ha, you have got a Cup to much;
umh, goe to and goe to, you can hold no more, I see that, at this time;

plaistered and bound up? bloody? how comes this? goe too and goe to; if
I have done any mischiefe or bene over valiant in my drinke to kill a
man or soe, why 'twas in my drinke, not I, and let my drinke be hangd
for't; or, I say and I sayt, let um stay till I am drunke againe and
then hange me; I care not, I shall not be sensible of it. Oh this sack!
it makes a coward a <emphasis>Hector</emphasis>: the <emphasis>Greekes</emphasis> and <emphasis>Troians</emphasis> drinke no
other; and that and a wench (for theres the divell out) made um cuffe
ten yeares together, till at length when they had bled more than they
coulde drinke they grew sober, the contented Cuckold tooke his wife home
againe and all were good frends[89]. [<emphasis>Sease Musicke</emphasis>] But stay, the

<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Ha, alive? in the name of drinke what have I don? where did you
find me, ha?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Why, sir, comming out—umh, umh—</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Out with't, man.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Out of a bad-house, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. A Bawdie house, I warrant.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Yes sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Why, now its out.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. I, and tis well your worships out.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Noe, noe, it had bin better had I never gon in; but on, on.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. You were, sir,—as they say, sir—you had gotten a Cup to
much.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Hang Cupps, my friend excepted; goe to; speake plaine; I was
drunke was I?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Yes, sir; you were not able to stand when you came out, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Out of the Bawdy-house? I beleave thee; nay, I am a right
<emphasis>Lovell</emphasis> I, I look like a shotten herring now for't. <emphasis>Jone's</emphasis> as good
as my lady in the darke wee me. I have no more Roe than a goose in me;
but on to the mischiefe, on.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. You beate the Bawd downe with the Chamber dore and bade her
keepe that for the Reckoning.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Umh, there was witt in my drinke, I perceive; on.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Then, sir, you tooke up a Spitt.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. A Spitt?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Yes, sir, and broacht one of the wenches out.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. How?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Oh, sir, you made such a hole in her bakside[91] you might
have turnd—
                [<emphasis>Blows his nose</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. What? thy nose int?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Had I been there it had been at your service.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Thanke thee; thou shouldst have lost nothing by it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Then went Tobackoe pipes to wrack, and oh the black potts
sufferd without measure; nay, you swore (and for it paid your twelve
pence) that if you were maior youd come disguisd on purpose to
confou[nd] 'um.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Ist possible I could doe this?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. This, sir? Why you kickd one flat-nosd wench that snuffled,
and swore she was a puritan.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Did not I pay for that oath too?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. No, sir; you bid the Constable keepe reckoning till it came to
a some and you would pay him in totall. So, sir, with the spit in your
hand away you runn, and we after yee, where you met with a roaring
Captain.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Ha, now, now comes the misfortune.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Then you stopt and stood a while waving to and froe, as in
suspense; at length you fell, with a forward thrust, quite through his
heart.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Ha, through his heart? the Captaines dead then?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. No sir, twas through a silver heart he weares in memory of
his Mrs.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Ime glad of that: thou strukst me through the heart with thy
newes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. You being downe, on fell the Captain like a tyrannicall
<emphasis>Dutch</emphasis> man of war that shewes no mercy to the yeelding enemy, and ere
we could bring succor gave you these wounds, which being dark we brought
you home as privately as possible, sett you to sleepe and here stayd
till your waking.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Yare honest fellowes; goe to and go to, I say and I sait agen,
yare honest fellowes and shall not be unrewarded: looke you, theres for
you—and be but sylent in't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. As is my instrument, Sir. Coods me! what, have they torne away
the back of your satteen Doublet? the Canvas is seene.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Umh, no, but they have stolne my velvet Jerkin.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. I, and dam'd your Dublet.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Tis well; goe; thanks; goe, Ile see you shortly; you and your
Companie shall play at my ladyes wedding. I say no more, goe to; I love
you and I thanke you,</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. I thanke you, good Mr. Steward.    [<emphasis>Discovers</emphasis></p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Whoes this? <emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Even he that has thus begrimd yee, my fine drunken Steward. I
can cure you, toe; come, let me be your Surgion.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Thou shalt be my hangman first, Rascall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. You wonnot murder? helpe Captain, Mr. <emphasis>Crackby, Tim</emphasis>!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Omnes</emphasis>.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Geffry and Lady</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. But I beseech you, Madam; what greater accession[93] can you
wish then me for husband? I have it here thats sattisfaction for the
lustiest widdow twixt this and London. Say, will you love me? Ime in
hast and hate demurrs; if you refuse I must seeke out: I have a little
moysture and would be loth to hav't dride for want of exercise.—What
say you, lady?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Sir, for your love I thanke you; for your wealth
I want it not; but yet I doe not find
A disposicon in my selfe to marriage.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. That will not serve my turne; I am no knight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who weares the spurr of honour without Rowells</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To prick a woman forwards: I ride post</p>
<empty-line/>

To Marriage and resolve at the next stage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To take my Inn up. You have here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two beautifull young gallants to your daughters:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since youle not be my wife yet be my mother;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile marry any of them, which you please,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And hood her with the bagg [badge?] of honor. Lady,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What say you to this motion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. My daughters wills are not in my command:
If you can purchase either of their hearts,
My free consent shall follow.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Geff</emphasis>. Nay, then, they will fall out for me, Madam,
I am most fortunate in atcheiving virgins.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Bonville</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Save you, sweet youth, the bewties of your Mrs.</p>

Crowne your desires. Are you a suiter?</p>

<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Madam, I have occasions of importance
Wishes a little privacy with you.</p>

Pray you vouchsafe your absence; at more leasure
We shall discourse.</p>

<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. You did desire we should.</p>

<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Unles we be to loud:
What mooves you to require this secresie?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. I come to aske a question, which the winds;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I could deafe them, should not heare for feare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their repercussive Eccho should declare it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To all our infamies.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. What ist, I pray you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Your daughter whom I was a servant to,
—I must deliver it in the homeliest phrase—
Is she dishonest?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. You urge a repetition, gentle sir,
Of a sad truth: she is.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. It cannot be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In reason comprehensible a mother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should for a stranger blurr her daughters fame,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were it untruth. I am confirmd; this favor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Transcends requitall: if a man misled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By error gainst the diety, gross enough</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For his damnation, owe a gratitude</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To his converter, I am engag'd to you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For my delivery from her.</p>
<empty-line/>

Then what my honor obligd me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And my respect to vertue, which in you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I should have murdred by my silence; but</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have not greife enough left to lament</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The memory of her folly: I am growne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Barren of teares by weeping; but the spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is not yet quite exhausted.    [<emphasis>Weeps</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Keepe your teares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lest the full clouds, ambitious that their drops</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should mix with yours, unteeme their big wombd laps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And rayse a suddeine deluge. Gratious madam,</p>
<empty-line/>

The oftner you reherse her losse the more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You intimate the gaine I have acquird</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By your free bounty, which to me appeares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So farr transcending possibility</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of satisfaction that, unles you take</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My selfe for payment, I can nere discharge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A debt so waytie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Ist come to this?
You speake misteriously; explaine your meaning.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. To consecrate, with that devotion
That holy Hermits immolate[94] theire prayers,
My selfe the adorer of your vertues.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Are you serious?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. No scrupulous penitent, timerous that each thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should be a sinn, does to the priest lay ope</p>
<empty-line/>

With halfe that verity his troubled soule</p>

Include all ceremony. No sooner had</p>

Your information disingagd my heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of honoring your daughter, but amazd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At the immensnesse of the benefit</p>

<p>

Your goodness had cast on me, I resolvd</p>
<empty-line/>

This way to show my gratitude.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. But dare you,
Knowing the daughter vicious, entertaine
Affection to the mother?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Dare I when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have bin long opresd with a disease,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wish pleasing health? theres vertue enough here</p>
<empty-line/>

To excite beleife in <emphasis>Moores</emphasis> that only women</p>
<empty-line/>

Have heavenly soules.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. This is admirable:</p>

Did my intention tend to love, as soone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I should embrace your motion in that kind</p>
<empty-line/>

As any others, wert but to afford</p>

Some small lustracon for the wrong my daughter</p>
<empty-line/>

Intended you; nay, to confesse my thought,</p>

I feele a strong propension in my selfe</p>

Then to beleive them.</p>

So manifestly [in]constant.</p>

Orewhelme my dull capacity with horror:
Inconstant!</p>

Can more abhorre the Error he has left</p>

Than I do mine. I do beleive thee chast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the straight palme; as absolute from spots</p>

As the immaculate Ermine, who does choose,</p>

When he is hunted by the frozen <emphasis>Russe</emphasis>,</p>

To meete the toyle ere he defile the white</p>

To expiatt the scandall I have throwne</p>

On holy Innocence?</p>

This as a pennance: you shall now declare</p>

The author of your wrong report.</p>

Could have inducd me to such a madnes.</p>

Not desperate of remission, that without</p>

Sense of compu[n]ction dares imagine lies</p>

Soe horrible and godlesse? My disgrace</p>

Was wrong sufficient to tempt mercie, yet</p>

Inferd toth piety of my guiltless mother</p>

Stops all indulgence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bon</emphasis>. Will you not heare me out?</p>

I doe renounce my affection to you; when
You can speake truth, protest you love agen.

From an uniust suspition your conceite</p>

<p>

In the unlucky message that pronouncd you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Empty of honor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Has your worthles freind
Hird you to sweare this?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I'me none that live

With all his cunning policie regaine</p>
<empty-line/>

My good opinion of him. Sir, you cannot</p>

Doe a more pleasing office then to leave me:</p>

I do not love to heare of him.</p>

Not to heare out the Gent[leman].</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Prethe why?</p>

His owne confession does appeach him one</p>
<empty-line/>

In the conspiracy against my honor.</p>

He sayes my mother was the originall</p>

Twere for a child to thinke so, filiall duty</p>

Your piety may misleade you. Though your mother,</p>

We have some conference will admit no audience</p>

<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Why, that you would with Judgment overlooke
This lovely countenance.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. The hangman shall doe't sooner.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. If you knew
How many bewtious gentlewomen have sued
To have my picture—</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. To hang at their beds head for a <emphasis>memento mori</emphasis>—</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. You would regard it with more curiosity.
There was a merchants daughter the other day
Runn mad at sight of itt.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. It scared her from her witts: she thought the

<p><emphasis>Suc</emphasis>. Valour deserves regard, myne shall propugne

<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Alasse! mine is so meane,
None will contend with it, it needs no champions.</p>

<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Most nobly propagatted; my father was a man
Well fu[rnish'd] with white and yellow mettall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. I lay my life a Tinker.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. And in his parish of account.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. A Scavenger.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bel</emphasis>. Is it a badge of your profession
To be uncivell?</p>

Goe, get you home toth Cittie; goe solicitt</p>

And tell thy mother how thou has't sped i'th country,</p>
<empty-line/>

And let her moane thee.</p>

I have perform'd, to have some salary?</p>

Noe labourer works without his hier; I would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be satisfied when you determine we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall end our hopes in marriage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. I have lookt for this month in my Calender
And find that marriage is prohibited.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. It is not Lent nor Advent;[101] if it were
The Court is not so strickt but 'twill dispense
With freinds, and graunt a licence.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Whole be bound
With you that theres no hindrance but we may
Be lawfully espoused?</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Ime not so barren
Of freinds but I shall find security
For what will nere be question'd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. It may be soe; but one who calculated
My birth did warne me to abstaine from marriage
Til I was twenty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. You're no <emphasis>Atlanta</emphasis>; if you be, Ile play
<emphasis>Hippomanes</emphasis> and over runn you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. You'd scarce catch me,</p>

Though you had <emphasis>Venus</emphasis> apples to seduce</p>

<p>

My covetous eyes. Henceforth Ide have you leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your love to me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. I must leave to live then.
Why doe you say soe?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Cause it is [un]iust
You should mispend affection on her
Who is incapeable of it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. You'd faine wrest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A new expence of complement from me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you delight to heare your praise, Ile hire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some mercenary [poet][102] to comend</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In lofty verse your bewty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. You are merry:
My humor is not specious; we must know
A further distance.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Wherefore, pray?
Our eyes are no more poysonous then they were.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Yes, they infect reciprocall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. This language</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is not accustomd; pray, tell me how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My presence is offensive, and Ile shun you[103]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As I would doe my fate. You are not serious:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My innocence assures me my deserts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can chalenge no such usage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Tis confest; but we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are like thinne christall glasses that will crack</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By touching one another: I coniure thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By all our past love, from this parting minute</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nere to behold me more. I dare not venter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My frailty with thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. What immodesty
Has my demeaner uttred you should doubt
Ravishing from me?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Thats not it, but cause</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not tempt my destinie: thy sight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would inflame marble, much more me whose heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is prompt enough to fly into thy breast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And leave mine empty. But 'tmust not remaine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In that lone habitation, least a curse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A fearefull one, sease on mee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Can there be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Curses more horrid, incident to earth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For its past Sinns, then would depend on you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For such a bold presumption as your breatch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of faith would be.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Our tyrant fate has found</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet uninvented torments to expresse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our loyall soules. O, <emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>, thou wert never</p>

—Not when our mutuall freindships might have taught</p>

The constant turtles amity—more deare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To me then now. I could, as well as then,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Peruse love's dictats in thy amorous cheeks,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enioy the pressure of thy modest lipp;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But Ime enioynd by powerfull menaces</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'infring my wonted use and to disclaime</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My vowes to thee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. If this be possible,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What will become of earth? men will no more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Respect Society or strive to save</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Humanity alive: henceforth theyle seeke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For lost fidelity on Caves or topps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of untrodd Rocks, and plight their trothes to beasts;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Commix with them and generate a race</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of creatures, though less rationall, yet more</p>
<empty-line/>

Indude with truth. O <emphasis>Clariana</emphasis>, can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There be a motive able to convert</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This pretious Christall temple, built for purity</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And goodnes adoration, to a faine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For Idoll falshoods worship? But I cannot</p>
<empty-line/>

Labour my wandring Judgment to beleife</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou speakst thy meaning. If I have not lovd</p>
<empty-line/>

With that essential perfectnes thy worth</p>

That man could doe, in charity declare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My Ignorant defect, and Ile amend it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With more then zealous industry.</p>
<empty-line/>

You may as easily penetrate the cloudes</p>

With a soft whisper, as my eares, then which</p>

I have in the intemperate heate of blood</p>

Given up my soule to a new choyce, that breeds</p>

This soddaine mutability: I will</p>

Preserve my affection as inviolate to you</p>

As Anchorites their vowes, and in my grave</p>

<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Tis above wonder: could I as well rule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her will as her exterior actions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She should not thus reject you; but I cannot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Limitt her mind, compell her to affect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against her liking. If perswations may</p>
<empty-line/>

Reduse her, Ile endevour it.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>

I am resolvd to meet her in revolt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hug infidelity with as strong a faith</p>

As she can possible; and if mans mallice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can passe a womans, my dispight shall winne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Preheminence. I will inquire out one</p>

By nature framd in scorne of bewty, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In your perfidious daughters presence give her</p>
<empty-line/>

That heart which she reiected.</p>

In worth's inferior to you, yet I doubt not</p>
<empty-line/>

But my perswasive oratorie may gaine you</p>

Her forfeited affection.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Let her reserve it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For them who sue to inioy it; Ile conferr</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My fancy on a Negro new reclaim'd</p>

From prostitution; sacrifice my youth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bedridd age, ere reinthrall my heart</p>

<p>

To abjure a certaine and a pleasing good</p>
<empty-line/>

For an uncertaine harme you would impose</p>

In malice on another. Yo'are a man</p>

In whome the glorious soule of goodnes moves</p>

With such a spacious posture that no woman,</p>
<empty-line/>

Your affirmation: could you love me?</p>

What others might doe, but not argument</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I meant to love you.</p>

Presages mercy; and those eyes, whose lustre</p>

The light (that scornes privation) cannot equall,</p>
<empty-line/>

Darts beames of comfort on me.</p>
<empty-line/>

Could you perswade me to't, I can find</p>
<empty-line/>

No such propension in my selfe; beware</p>

You are not well.</p>

Exceeding well yett; all my faculties</p>

Retaine their wonted motion; but Ime like</p>
<empty-line/>

A new recoverd patient, whose relapse</p>

Admitts no helpe of phisick: in your love</p>

Consists my hope, futurity of health;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And you have too much charity to suffer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perdition overwhelme me.</p>

Workes much uppon my lenity; but twould</p>

Occasion scandall; every one would judge</p>
<empty-line/>

Those who imagine such prodigious mischiefes</p>

Participation in me of that spiritt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I most detest, a womans.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Please your good Ladyship.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Yes, that you depart.—    [<emphasis>Exit Alexander</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What can he see in her more worthy love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then is in me? shees but a picture drawne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By my dimensions, and men sooner fancy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Substance then the Shaddow. Oh, but shee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is the true image not of what I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But what I was, when like the spring I wore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My virgin roses on my cheeks.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. Madam, you seeme—</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Angry at your impertinency; learne manners, leave me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lov</emphasis>. She has coniurd downe my spirit: these are immodest devills that
make modest ladyes become strickers[118]. Ile out oth storme, take
shelter in the cellar. Goe to and goe to; tis better venter quarriling
mongst those hogesheads.
                            [<emphasis>Exit Alexander</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Maudlin [and Timothy.]</emphasis></p>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. Madam, your daughter—</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Where is she? Who? <emphasis>Clariana</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ma</emphasis>. The faire <emphasis>Belisea</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Clariana</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Did you call me, madam.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Noe: were you soe neere? begon againe,—
Yet stay.—<emphasis>Maudlin</emphasis>, avoid the Roome, and if you see
Mr. <emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>, entreat him hither. <emphasis>Timothy</emphasis>,
Find out my son and charge him to delay
The execution of my late comaund
Till I next speake with him.    [<emphasis>Exeunt Mag. and Tim</emphasis>.
<emphasis>Clariana</emphasis>, you did what I comanded?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Yes, on my Soule.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. But thou art ignorant
Why with such violence I inioyn[e]d thee
To leave thy <emphasis>Thurstons</emphasis> love?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Were I not sure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Theres nought in him that can be titled ill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I should have thought your circumspective Judgment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had spide some error in him, and in care</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of me your child forbidden me his love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But whatsoer's the cause, though your comaund</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was like perdition welcome, my obedience</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fullfild it truly, without questioning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The reason why or the unlimited power</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of you my mother.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. You did very well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now thou shalt know the reason, which before</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I doe relate, afford me leave to weepe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To save thy teares, which at the hearing of it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will, like the dew on lillies, pearle thy cheekes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have beheld thee with a Rivalls eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In <emphasis>Thurstons</emphasis> love; my penetrable heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a moist cloud, has opened and receivd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Loves fine bolt into it. Now thou knowst it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Methinks I see confusion in thy lookes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prepard to blast me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Heaven forbid it I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should ere conceive the meanest thought of ill</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of you, my parent. Since you love him, here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To heaven and you I give my interest up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And would I could as well commaund his heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As he might mine, beleive me you should then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Affect you with as true and deare a zeale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As ever I did him: I should be happie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In making you soe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Charitable girle,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forgive thy cruell mother, who must yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Impose a stronger penance on thy duty:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou must go to thy <emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>, and obtaine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. A little labour will serve for that.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Not for thy selfe but for thy haplesse mother,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who am, without it, nothing. Woe him for me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Use the inchanting musicke of thy voice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On my behalfe, who, though thy Rivall, yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Remember I'm thy mother; nor canst thou</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Consigne thy breath to a more holy use</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Though thou shouldst spend it in religious prayers)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then to redeeme thy parent. Weepe for me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in requitall for each drop thou shedst</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I'll pay to heaven a Hecatombe of teares</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thy successe. But take good heede, deare child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While thou art weeping, thou dost not disclose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That face of thine; for, were he mine by vow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Loves powerfull Retorick uttered [in?] thyne eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would winn from me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Thurston and Thorowgood</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Here comes the Gentleman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Be earnest, <emphasis>Clariana</emphasis>, I shall heare you.
                                           [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Sir, you must iuistifie this.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Feare it not; yonder she goes; I'll tell her of it, sheele not
denie it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Mr. <emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>, whether do you walke soe fast?</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. O, <emphasis>Clarianna</emphasis>, are you there?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Nay, stay, I have a suite to you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. I would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be loth to offend your eyes; when we last met</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You chargd me never to behold you more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. I did indeed, but on mature advice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have reclaimd that imposition.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You shall behold me dayly, talke with me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doe all the acts that love with Innocence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can suffer, if youle but overrule your will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To graunt me one request.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. You wrong my faith</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In questioning my graunt of any thing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You can desire wer't to undoe my selfe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or combate miseries as yet unheard of,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You[r] least breath may expose me to them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Nay, in this theres no danger; if there be
A real happines on earth, this way
You shall arrive to it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. He were unwise
Would he not graunt it then.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Please you declare it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. There is a lady,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of such a perfect virtue, grace and sweetnes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That Nature was to all our sex beside</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A niggard, only bountiful to her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One whose harmonious bewtie may intitule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All hearts its captive: yet she doats on you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With such a masculine fancy that to love her</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is duty in you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. It is herselfe, Ime sure.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. It surely is no other.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. No, tis one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So farr transcending me, that twere a sinne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should I deprive you, the most perfect man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of her, the perfectest woman. She will weepe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Even at your name; breath miriads of sighes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wring her hands thus; demonstrate all the signes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of a destracted lover; that in pitty,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though I did love you well, I have transferd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My right to her, and charge you by all ties</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That you affect her with the same true zeale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which you did me, and ift be possible,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Purer and better.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. This is the strangest madnes I ere heard of.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Is it you, <emphasis>Clariana</emphasis>, that speake all this?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. You know and heare it is.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. But I doe scarce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Credit my hearing, or conceive I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Mortall, for surely, had I bin, your words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like the decree of heaven had struck me dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What strong temptation lay you on my faith!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, <emphasis>Clariana</emphasis>, let me but decline</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Passion, and tell you seriously that this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is cruel in you, first to scorne my love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Next to admitt a scruple of beleife,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Though you can be perfidious to your selfe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I can be soe. Noe; since you are lost,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile like the solitary turtle mourne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cause I must live without you. But, pray, tell me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What is she you would have me love?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. My Mother.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Ha, your Mother!</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Ist possible, lady? you much doe wrong</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your innocence in laboring to enforce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That upon him which is my interest. Heaven</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Smild at the contract twixt us; quiers of Saints</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Receivd our mutuall vowes, and though your Mother</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May in her passion seeme to have forgott</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her pretious faith, yet when I shall awake</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her sleeping reason with the memory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of that has past betwixt us, my strong hope</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tells me I shall induce her to the spheare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which she has movd from.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. Would heaven you could! How coldly in this cause</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doe I perswade! when I would speake, my heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Checks its bold orator, my tongue, and tells it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tis traitorous to its Mr.—Noble Sir,    [<emphasis>kneele</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I doe conceit you infinitly good,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So pittiful that mercy is in you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Even naturally superlative, (forgive me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I offend) you doe in this transgresse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Humanity, to let a lady love you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without requitall. But I must professe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To heaven and you, that here Ile fix to earth,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Weepe till I am a statue, but Ile gaine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your pitie for her: pray consider ont.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Consider ont? wonder has soe engrossd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To its wild use all corners of my heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That there remaines scarce one poore concave left</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To hold consideration. I must either</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Love her I hate or see her whome I love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wilfully perish. See, shee kneeles and weeps,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prays as she meant to expiate all the sinns</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Earth ere committed. One of those pure drops</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Does (as my lives blood in a soddaine trance)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Surround my heart. You have prevaild, arise:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At your request I will performe an act,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which may no story hold least all who love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hereafter curse the president,—Ile love her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That deathfull word comes from my torturd soule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As a consent doth from a timorous maid</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For an enforcing ravisher.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. You are not mad, sir? what doe you meane?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cla</emphasis>. I thanke you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But love her dearely, <emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>, sheele deserv't:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I doe remember, when my Father livd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How he would praise her goodnes. Think on me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As one that lovd you well, but neer like her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, if you please, bestow each day a kisse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Uppon her in my memory. Soe, farewell.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sorrows flow high: one griefe succeed another;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I die in piety to redeeme my Mother.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. But, harke you, sir, do you intend to love her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Good sir, torment me not.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Grimes</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. By your leave, gentlemen: good Mr.
<emphasis>Thorowgood</emphasis>, a word or two in private.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Compeld to love my enemy! what man,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That had but so much spiritt as a mule,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Could suffer this! Lay nice prescriptions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ambiguous bookmen, on submissive slaves;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Affright with terror of a wilfull death</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Those whom black murders of inhumane sin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Has living damnd; Ime yet in my owne heart</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

White as a babe, as Innocent as light</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From any mortall guilt; and were my soule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Drawn fro this mew[119] of flesh twould quickly streatch</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a swift Falkon her aspiring wings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And soare at heaven. Nature instructs us Death</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is due to all: how can't be then a Sinn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To die, or he more guilty of offense</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That kills himselfe or [than?] he who in his bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some shivoring ague murders? Ime resol[v']d;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile rather chuse to immolate my life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In Martirdome to virtue then reserve't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Till it be staind with mischiefes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Lady</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. How doe you, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. Oh, oh, my head, my head!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stand further of, good nightcrow: if thou comst</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As a presaging harbinger of death,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Howlt in thy direfulst and most horrid notes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And ['t] will be wellcome as choyse musick to me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Ile adore thee fort, with teares of ioy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make thy black feathers white.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Good sir, mistake me not, I am your friend.</p>
<p><emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. I cry you mercy, lady; you are shee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whom I had vowd to love;—a wild conceite</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had seasd my fancy. Pardon me, I must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Proclaim to heaven and to the world a truth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which I should study to forget: you are</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A Creature so suparlatively bad</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That, were the earth as absolute from sinn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As in its first creation, youre sole crimes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would pull a curse upon it. I should tell you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The specialties wherein you're foule, but dare not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Breath in the same ayre with you; I begin</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To feel infection:—fare you well.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Contemnd againe! deprive me of the name
And soule of woman! render me a scorne
To the most base of our revengefull sex!
If I beare this while there be knives or swords,
Poyson or ought left to extinguish life
That womans spleene can compasse—
<emphasis>Alexander</emphasis>! within there!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Alexander</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Goe to my sonn; inioyne him by all rights</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of naturall duty to accomplish that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which in youre hearing I comanded him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beare him this Jewell and this gold, that when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tis don he may escape; be carefull,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As you expect my favour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Alex</emphasis>. I shall inculcate your desires unto him.
—Her favour! goe to, theres comfort.
                                          [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Thorowgood</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Madam, theres one brings a sad message to you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. From whome, I pray you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. From two friends of yours
Your cruelty has murdred,</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. My cruelty
Never extended to that horrid height,
Not to my foes. Who are they?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Your daughter,
The innocent <emphasis>Belisia</emphasis>, and my friend,
Her worthy suiter, <emphasis>Bonvill</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Your freind and my daughter dead and by my meanes!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This cannot be; my daughters sure in the house.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good sir, unfould this ridle, it begetts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wonder and terror in me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Madam, you know with what a cruel messuage</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You sent me to my friend, which provd as false</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As your faire daughter virtuous. Why you did it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not question, nor upbraid you with</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This violation of your faith.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. This story
Conduces nothing to the deathes you talkd of.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Yes, since then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A iust mistrust that you would crosse their match</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Causd them last night privatly to steale hence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With an intention to have reacht the house</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where <emphasis>Bonvills</emphasis> mother lives; but see the fates</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How they dispose of men! crossing the River</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That runns beneath your orchard, and ith darke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Their headstrong horses missing the ford overthrew them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, which I cannot without true griefe utter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There drownd them both.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was it not soe, <emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Tis too sad a truth; and I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

After all meanes to save their life was past,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lookd to my owne and got the shore: their bodies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I feare the violence of the tide has carried</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Into the Sea by this time.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Enough, good friend; no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Had a rude <emphasis>Scythian</emphasis>, ignorant of teares,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unlesse the wind enforcd them from his eyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heard this relation, sure he would have wept;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And yet I cannot. I have lost all sense</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of pitty with my womanhood, and now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That once essentiall Mistress of my soule,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Warme charity, no more inflames my brest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Than does the glowewormes ineffectual fire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The ha[n]d that touches it. Good sir, desist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The agravation of your sad report;    [<emphasis>Weepe</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ive to much greife already.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. It becomes you:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You do appeare more glorious in these t[ears]</p>

perceive me sir: as Ime a gentleman I lov'd the lady; but she, out of
her pride, I thinke, or else I were to b[lame] to say soe, scornd me.
Marke you that, sir? understand you that?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. You question my understanding very much, good Sir
<emphasis>Geffe[rey]</emphasis>. But pray you, sir, being here more conversant then I,
c[ould] you informe me how this quarrell grew twixt her [and Mr.]
<emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Yes, yes, I can;—but let me see, I have almost forgott;
to say truth, I never heard the reason, but as the wisest guess—hum,
hum—he should have had her daughter.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. I might have had her my self, you know, uncle.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Peace, Nephew, peace, give Justice leave to speake.—As I

<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. You did; but what does that conduce to their dissention?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Oh sir, the originall efficient cause,—you understand me?
for suspition whispers he had given her a foule blow and would have left
her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Nay, by my birthright, uncle, the child was not his alone, for I
dare sweare I had a hand at least in it. I did endevor fort, did I not,
Captaine?</p>

to write their confessions quickly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>. They are not come yet to confession, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Noe matter for that, <emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>; with the Judges leave weele
here their confession before they come, that we may know the better to
state the cause when they doe come. Ist not best, thinke you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. Who shall speake for them, thinke you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. No matter whether any man speake nor noe: we know he killed
the man, and she comanded him, ergo they are guilty; ergoe that must be
their confession, scilicet that they are guilty. Write this, <emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>,
and then we will perpend, as law and Judgment guides us, whether we will
save or condemne. How say you, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. Oh well don, uncle! I knew[128] he would prove what he said,
otherwise I would have venturd a sillogisme in Baraly[p]ton to have made
it evident.</p>

<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Marke that, Sir: shee that slew him! do you hear?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. Pray disturbe her not.—How comes it then, Madam, to be
affirmd your Sonn did kill him?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. I, lets heare that, how it comes: well remembred, you did
even speake before me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Crac</emphasis>. O how learnedly could I speake now, might I have licence!</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Pray, Sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me not be oppresd with noyse; my cause</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beares not so slender waight. For my owne life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So many reasons forfeit it to death</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That 'twere a Sinn, had I a will to live,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To plead to save it; but for this my sonn</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I do beseech a hearing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. Speake freely, lady.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Thus then:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Suppose the wrested rigor of your lawes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Uniustly sentenc'd any here to death,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And you enforce on some unwilling man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The present execution of your act,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You will not after cause the instrument</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of your decree, as guilty of his blood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To suffer as a Homicide: how then</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Can your impartiall Judgment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Censure my sonn for this which was my fact?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Thurston</emphasis> the malice of my will wishd dead:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My instigation and severe comaund</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Compeld him to atcheiv't, and you will graunt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Noe princes lawes retaine more active force</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To ingage a subiect to performe their hests</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then natures does astring a dewtious child</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To obey his parent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Pish, all this is nothing: there is a flat statute against
it,—let me see,—in Anno vigessimo tricessimo, Henerio octavo be it
enacted,—what followes, <emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. Nay, good Sir, peace—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Madam, these are but wild evasions</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For times protraction; for your paritie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It cannot hold; since Nature does enforce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Noe child to obey his parent in an act</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That is not good and iust.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Why, this seemd both</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To his obedience; but relinquish that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And come to Conscience: does it not comaund</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In its strict Canons to exact no more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then blood for blood, unlesse you doe extort</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Worse then an usurer. For <emphasis>Thurstons</emphasis> life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I offer myne, which if it be to meane</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To appease your Justice, let it satisfie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your mercie. Spare my Sonn and I shall goe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As willingly to death as to my rest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

After a painfull child birthe. Looke on him!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How fitt the subiect is to invite your pittie!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What Tyrant hand would cut this Cedar up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ere its full groath (at which it stately head</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would give a shade to heaven), or pluck this Rose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As yet scarce blossomd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Hum, what says <emphasis>Bunch</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Mercy wilbe proud</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'infold him gently in her Ivory armes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And, as she walkes along with him, each word</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He speakes sheele greedily catch at with a kisse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From his soft lipps such as the amorous Fawnes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enforce on the light Satyrs. Let[130] me dy</p>

Of fruite and moysture, prostratly doe begg</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A Charitable headsman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. So bad a cause</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Deserves not to be pleaded thus. Deere madam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Greife overwhelmes me for you, that your guilt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Has damp'd the eyes of mercy and undone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All intercession. Please you desist:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We must proceed to th'examination</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the other prisoners.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir <emphasis>Geffrey</emphasis>, we shall need your grave assistance:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sir <emphasis>Geffrey</emphasis>, be more attentive.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Tis very necessary. I wilbe sworne she did bewitch me; I
thinke I was almost asleepe. But now to yee, I faith; come on, what can
you say that Judgment shall not passe against you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Sir, you are the Judge here?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Hu</emphasis>. Yes, sir, why question you my power?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Noe, scarlett man, I question thy witt,</p>

At least thy Humanity and the Conscience</p>

Gray bearded miscreant, whose best acts compard</p>
<empty-line/>

<p>[<emphasis>Suc</emphasis>.[131] The man speaks home and boldly.]</p>

<p><emphasis>Sir Gef</emphasis>. Yes, what are you, Sir. I aske to, though

<p><strong>INTRODUCTION TO THE TRAGEDY OF SIR JOHN VAN OLDEN BARNAVELT.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I have never met anywhere with the slightest allusion to this fine
historical play, now for the first time printed from a MS.[140] in the
British Museum (Add. MS. 18,653). It is curious that it should have been
left to the present editor to call attention to a piece of such
extraordinary interest; for I have no hesitation in predicting that
Barnavelt's Tragedy, for its splendid command of fiery dramatic
rhetoric, will rank among the masterpieces of English dramatic
literature.</p>
<p>On a first rapid inspection I assumed, with most uncritical
recklessness, that Chapman was the author. There are not wanting points
of general resemblance between Chapman's Byron and the imperious,
unbending spirit of the great Advocate as he is here represented; but in
diction and versification, the present tragedy is wholly different from
any work of Chapman's. When I came to transcribe the piece, I soon
became convinced that it was to a great extent the production of
Fletcher. There can, I think, be no reasonable doubt about the
authorship of such lines as the following:—</p>
<p>    "<emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>. My noble Lords, what is't appeares upon me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So ougly strange you start and fly my companie?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What plague sore have ye spide, what taynt in honour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What ill howre in my life so cleere deserving</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>Such a verse as,—</p>
<p>    "In every Princes Court highly esteemd of,"</p>
<p>or,—</p>
<p>    "Now in the time you ought to fix your faith fast,"</p>
<p>can belong only to Fletcher. The swelling, accumulative character of the
eloquence is another proof; for Fletcher's effects are gained not by a
few sharp strokes, but by constant iteration, each succeeding line
strengthening the preceding until at last we are fronted by a column of
very formidable strength. Let us take another extract from the same
scene:—</p>
<p>    "<emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>. When I am a Sychophant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And a base gleaner from an others favour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shame take that smoothness and that sleeke subjection!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I am myself, as great in good as he is,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As much a master of my Countries fortunes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And one to whom (since I am forc'd to speak it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Since mine own tongue must be my Advocate)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This blinded State that plaies at boa-peep with us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    This wanton State that's weary of hir lovers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And cryes out 'Give me younger still and fresher'!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Is bound and so far bound: I found hir naked,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Floung out a dores and starvd, no friends to pitty hir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The marks of all hir miseries upon hir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    An orphan State that no eye smild upon:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And then how carefully I undertooke hir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How tenderly and lovingly I noursd hir!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But now she is fatt and faire againe and I foold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And I must sue to him! be witnes, heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    If this poore life were forfeyt to his mercy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    At such a rate I hold a scornd subjection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I would not give a penney to redeeme it.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>The whole scene is singularly fine and impressive; it shows us Fletcher
at his highest.</p>
<p>But in other passages we find a second hand at work. In the second scene
of the third act there is far less exuberance of language and a
different style of versification, as may be seen in the following
lines:—</p>
<p>    "<emphasis>Orange</emphasis>. My grave Lords,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That it hath byn my happines to take in,</p>
<empty-line/>

    That were falne off, is a large recompence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For all my travell; and I would advise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That (since all now sing the sweet tunes of Concord,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No Sword unsheathd, the meanes to hurt cut off</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all their stings pluckd out that would have usd them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Against the publique peace) we should end here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And not with labour search for that which will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Afflict us when 'tis found. Something I know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That I could wish I nere had understood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which yet if I should speake, as the respect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And duty that I owe my Country bids me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    It wilbe thought 'tis rather privat spleene</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then pious zeale. But that is not the hazard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which I would shun: I rather feare the men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    We must offend in this, being great, rich, wise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sided with strong friends, trusted with the guard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of places most important, will bring forth</p>
<empty-line/>

    Rather new births of tumult, should they be</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

    In their just punishment; and in doing Justice</p>
<empty-line/>

    On three or four that are delinquents, loose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So many thousand inocents that stand firme</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>

    To the scourge of their owne consciences: perhaps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Th'assurance that they are yet undiscoverd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Because not cyted to their answeare, will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    So work with them hereafter to doe well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That we shall joy we sought no farther in it."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Here we have vigorous writing, staid and grave and unimpassioned, and a
more regular metre. In determining questions of authorship I have so
often found myself (and others, too) at fault, that I shrink from
adopting the dictatorial tone assumed in these matters by learned
Germans and a few English scholars. But I think in the present instance
we may speak with tolerable certainty. Before my mind had been made up,
my good friend, Mr. Fleay, pronounced strongly in favour of Massinger.
He is, I think, right; in fact, it is beyond the shadow of a doubt that
Massinger wrote the speech quoted above. In all Massinger's work there
is admirable ease and dignity; if his words are seldom bathed in tears
or steeped in fire, yet he never writes beneath his subject. He had a
rare command of an excellent work-a-day dramatic style, clear, vigorous,
free from conceit and affectation. But he is apt to grow didactic, and
tax the reader's patience; and there is often a want of coherence in his
sentences, which amble down the page in a series of loosely-linked
clauses. I will not examine scene by scene in detail; for I must frankly
confess that I feel myself sometimes at a loss to determine whether a
particular passage is by Fletcher or Massinger. Most of the impassioned
parts belong, I think, to the former. I would credit Massinger with the
admirably conducted trial-scene in the fourth act; but the concluding
scene of the play, where Barnavelt is led to execution, I would ascribe,
without hesitation, to Fletcher. In the scene (v. 1) where the French
ambassador pleads for Barnavelt we recognise Massinger's accustomed
temperance and dignity. To the graver writer, too, we must set down
Leydenberg's solemn and pathetic soliloquy (iii. 6), when by a voluntary
death he is seeking to make amends for his inconstancy and escape from
the toils of his persecutors.</p>
<p>There is no difficulty in fixing the date of the present play. Barneveld
was executed on May 13, 1619, and the play must have been written
immediately afterwards, when all Christendom was ringing with the news
of the execution. In the third scene of the first act there is a
marginal note signed "G.B." The initials are unquestionably those of Sir
George Buc, Master of the Revels from 1610 to 1622.[141] On comparing
the note with an autograph letter[142] of Sir George's I find the
hand-writing to correspond exactly. The date, therefore, cannot be later
than 1622, but the probability is that the play was produced at
Michaelmas, 1619.</p>
<p>In our own day the great Advocate's fame, which had been allowed to fall
into neglect, has been revived with splendour by Mr. Motley, whose "Life
of John of Barneveld" is a monument <emphasis>aere perennius</emphasis> of loving labour,
masterful grasp, and rare eloquence. Had the dramatists been in
possession of a tithe of the facts brought to light from mouldering
state documents by the historian, they would have regarded Barneveld's
faults with a milder eye, and shown more unqualified praise for his
great and noble qualities. But they are to be commended in that they saw
partially through the mists of popular error and prejudice; that they
refused to accept a caricature portrait, and proclaimed in unmistakable
accents the nobility of the fallen Advocate. Perhaps it is not so
strange that this tragedy dropped from sight. Its representation
certainly could not have been pleasing to King James; for that
murderous, slobbering, detestable villain had been untiring in his
efforts to bring about Barneveld's ruin.</p>
<p>Throughout the play there are marks of close political observation. To
discover the materials from which the playwrights worked up their solid
and elaborate tragedy would require a more extensive investigation than
I care to undertake. An account of Barneveld's trial, defence, and
execution may be found in the following tracts:—</p>
<p>([Greek: alpha]) "Barnavel's Apologie, or Holland's Mysteria: with
marginall Castigations, 1618." The Apology, originally written in Dutch,
had been translated into Latin, and thence into English. The
Castigations, by "Robert Houlderus, Minister of the Word of God," are
remarkable, even in the annals of theological controversy, for gross
blackguardism. After indulging in the most loathsome displays of foul
brutality, this "Minister of the Word of God" ends with the cheerful
prayer,—"That they whom Thou hast predestinated to salvation may
alwayes have the upper hand and triumph in the certainty of their
salvation: but they whom Thou has created unto confusion, and as vessels
of Thy just wrath, may tumble and be thrust headlong thither whereto
from all eternitie Thou didst predestinate them, even before they had
done any good or evil."</p>
<p>([Greek: beta]) "Newes out of Holland: concerning Barnavelt and his
fellow-Prisoners, their Conspiracy against their Native Country with the
enemies thereof: The Oration and Propositions made in their behalfe unto
the Generall States of the United Provinces at the Hage, by the
Ambassadours of the French King," &amp;c., 1619.</p>
<p>([Greek: gamma]) "The Arraignment of John Van Olden Barnavelt, late
Advocate of Holland and West Freisland. Containing the articles
alleadged against him and the reasons of his execution," &amp;c., 1619.</p>
<p>       *       *       *       *       *</p>
<p>"This magnificent play is mainly the production of Fletcher and
Massinger: it must have been written between May, 1619, and May, 1622,
for the King's company acting at Blackfriars. T[homas] Hol[combe] acted
a woman's part in it: so did G. Lowin, perhaps a son of John Lowin,
unless indeed G. is a miswriting for J., as sometimes happens. It is
singular that one has no knowledge whatever of Thomas Holcombe, except
as an actor in Fletcher's plays: although so many of the lists of the
king's men of that date have come down to us. Mr. Gough who took the
part of Leidenberg, is Robert Gough, not Alexander: the latter acted
only in Charles I.'s time. Another actor, Michael, is unknown: probably
a super."—F.G. FLEAY.</p>
<p>Since the above paragraph was written, I have found in the MS. the names
of three more actors, Jo[hn] Rice, Bir[ch], and T[homas] Po[llard]. The
following note, for which I am indebted to Mr. Fleay, will be read with
interest:—"It is noticeable that a play called the Jeweller of
Amsterdam or the Hague, by John Fletcher, Nathaniel Field, and Phillip
Massinger, was entered on the Stationers' Books 8th April, 1654, but not
printed. This play must have been written between 1617 and 1619, while
Field was connected with the King's company, and undoubtedly referred to
the murder of John Van Wely, the Jeweller of Amsterdam, by John of
Paris, the confidential groom of Prince Maurice, in 1619. It is <emphasis>primâ
facie</emphasis> likely that the same authors would be employed on both plays.
Field, Daborne, Dekker and Fletcher are the only authors known to have
written in conjunction with Massinger; and Dekker and Daborne are out of
the question for that company at that date. We are now enabled to fix
the date of the 'Fatal Dowry,' by Field and Massinger, as c. 1618."</p>

That raild upon the Comissary.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. I remember.</p>
<p>1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Why, you dare charge a foe i'the head of his troope,
And shake you to deliver a petition
To a statesman and a frend?</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. I need not seek him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He has found me; and, as I am a soldier,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His walking towards me is more terrible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then any enemies march I ever mett with.</p>
<empty-line/>

And shall I be curbd by my lords the States,"</p>

(For thus you said in scorne) "that are but Merchants,</p>

<p>

Lawyers, Apothecaries, and Physitians,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perhaps of worser ranck"? But you shall know, Sir,</p>

They are not such, but Potentates and Princes</p>

From whom you take pay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. This indeed is stately:
Statesmen, d'you call 'em?</p>

'Twas wine and anger.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. No, Sir; want of dutie:</p>

But I will make that tongue give him the lye</p>

That said soe, drunck or sober; take my word for't.</p>

To your Great Generall, and see if he</p>

To make you what you were, shall labour for you.
And so, good morrow, Gentlemen.

For you have one friend left.</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. You are deceivd, Sir,
And doe not know his nature that gave promise
Of his assistance.</p>
<p>1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Who is't?</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. <emphasis>Leidenberck</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>

One of the Lords, the States, and of great powre too;</p>
<empty-line/>

I would he were as honest. This is he</p>

That never did man good, and yet no Suitor</p>

Ever departed discontented from him.</p>

Hee'll promise any thing: I have seene him talke</p>

For my yong lord his Son, when he has drunck hard.
There's no way els to doo't.</p>
<p>1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. I have gold good store</p>
<empty-line/>

You shall not want that; and if I had thought on't</p>

When I left <emphasis>London</emphasis>, I had fitted you</p>

For a convenient Pagan.</p>

Ile say in little; and in me theis Lords</p>

Promise as much. I am of your belief</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In every point you hold touching religion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And openly I will profes myself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the <emphasis>Arminian</emphasis> sect.</p>

<p><emphasis>Hog</emphasis>.[147] And all our praires and service.</p>

Your loves I am ambitious of. Already</p>

'Tis knowne I favour you, and that hath drawne</p>

<p>

Libells against me; but the stinglesse hate</p>

Of those that wryte them I contempne.</p>

<p><emphasis>Hog</emphasis>. They are worthie
Of nothing but contempt.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. That I confes, too;</p>

But yet we must expect much opposition</p>

Ere your opinions be confirmd. I know</p>

The <emphasis>Prince of Orange</emphasis> a sworne enemie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To your affections: he has vowd to crosse you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I will still stand for you. My advice is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That, having won the Burgers to your partie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Perswade them to enroll new Companies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For their defence against the Insolence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of the old Soldiers garisond at <emphasis>Utrecht</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet practise on them, too, and they may urge this:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That since they have their pay out of that Province,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Justice requires they should be of their partie:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All that is don in <emphasis>Utrecht</emphasis> shalbe practisd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In <emphasis>Roterdam</emphasis> and other Townes I name not.</p>

Farther directions you shall have hereafter,</p>

We will performe this.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.[148]</p>

They seldom have succes.</p>

And any thriving way we can make use of,</p>

What shape so ere it weares, to crosse their arts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We must embrace and cherish; and this course</p>

Our other actions. Make the Burgers ours,</p>

Raise Soldiers for our guard, strengthen our side</p>

Theis wrongs are neither few nor slight, nor followed</p>

By liberall tongues provokd by want or wine,</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

And every way a wise Prince fitt for counsell;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I must tell ye, Sir, and tell ye truly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Soldier has so blowne ye up, so swelld ye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And those few services you call your owne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That now our commendations are too light gales,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too slacke and emptie windes, to move your worthes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And trumpets of your owne tongue and the Soldiers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now onely fill your sailes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bre</emphasis>. Be not so bitter.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. We mix with quiet speritts, staid and temperate,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And those that levell at not great but good ends</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dare hold us their Companions, not their Servants,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in that ranck be ready to supply us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your Grace is growne too haughtie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Might it please you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But thinck, Sir, of our honest services</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(I dare not terme them equall) and but waigh well,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In which I know your Grace a perfect master,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your judgment excellent, and then but tell us</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And truly (which I know your goodnes will doe)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why should we seeme so poore, so undertrodden,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And though not trusted with the State and Councell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why so unable vallued. Pardon, great Sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If those complaine who feele the waight of envy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If such poore trod on wormes make show to turne againe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor is it we that feele, I hope, nor you, Sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That gives the cullour of this difference:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rumour has many tongues but few speak truth:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We feele not onely,—if we did 'twere happie—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our Cuntry, Sir, our Cuntrie beares the blow too;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But you were ever noble.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Or</emphasis>. Good my Lords,</p>
<empty-line/>

Let it be free your Servant, chargd in mallice,</p>
<empty-line/>

If not fling of his crymes, at least excuse 'em</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To you my great correcter. Would to heaven, Sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That syn of pride and insolence you speake of,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That pufft up greatnes blowne from others follyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were not too neere akin to your great Lordship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And lay not in your bosom, your most deere one.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You taint me, Sir, with syns concerne my manners,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I have such Ile studdy to correct 'em;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, should I taint you, I should charge ye deeper:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The cure of those would make ye shrinck and shake, too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

—Shake of your head.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. You are too weak ith' hams, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Or</emphasis>. Who raisd these new religious forces, Sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And by what warrant? what assignement had ye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From the States generall? who blew new fires?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Even fires of fowle rebellion, I must tell ye;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The bellowes to it, Religion. You were lov'd yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But for your ends,—through all the Townes, the Garrisons,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To fright the union of the State, to shake it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What syns are theis? You may smile with much comfort,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And they that see ye and not looke closely to ye</p>
<empty-line/>

May crye too er't be long.</p>

And tis right good it be soe.—Follow me home,</p>

To force this Towne, stand you still on your Guard,</p>

And on my reputation rest assured</p>

With violence they never dare attempt you;</p>

For want of strength to keepe it, the Conditions</p>

To guard this Cuntrie, not to ruyn it;</p>

And with unwearied steps to overcome</p>

A tedious march when the hot Lyons breath</p>

Do you thinck it's fitt we should be ignorant?</p>

<p>

Good Gentlewoman, no. Do you see this fellow?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is a Scholler and a parlous Scholler,</p>

Or whether he be a Scholler or no 'tis not a doy't matter:</p>

He's a fine talker and a zealous talker;</p>

We can make him thinck what we list, say what we list,</p>

For so we hold such here.</p>
<p><emphasis>Eng.-gentw</emphasis>. Doe they use no modestie
Upon my life, some of theis new <emphasis>Arminians</emphasis>,
Theis hissing tosts!</p>

Whose faith is onely tride by a Coach and foure horses.</p>

You doe not know the sweet on't.</p>

Our Cuntry brings us up to faire Obedience</p>

To know our husbands for our Governours,</p>

Nor Dare we thinck of what is don above us,</p>

The issues of your desperate undertakings,</p>

And to your greifes, what the deserts of those are</p>

That boldly dare attempt their Cuntries ruyn</p>

And who we serve, how faithfully and honestly</p>

You must and shall confes too: not to blind ends</p>

Hood-winckt with base ambition, such as yours are,</p>

But to the generall good.—Let[164] theis new Companies</p>

And there disarme;—wee'll teach ye true obedience;—</p>

Then let 'em quitt the Towne, hansom swag fellowes</p>

And fitt for fowle play.</p>

For there before the generall State—Where's <emphasis>Modesbargen</emphasis>?</p>

For the Towne, and what fitt Garrison to leave in't.</p>

<p><emphasis>Bre</emphasis>. Myne Heire Vandort, what thinck ye of the Prince now?</p>
<p><emphasis>Vandort</emphasis>. Like a true noble Gentlemen he has borne himself</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And a faire fortunate Soldier: I hold the State, Sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Most happie in his care, and this torne Cuntry,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whose wounds smart yet, most bound to his deliveraunce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bre</emphasis>. 'Tis certaine his proceedings in this busines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As in all els, have byn most wise and constant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And waited on with full wingd Expedition:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How many Townes armd with theis new Pretenders,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Stird up and steeld by founders of new doctrines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The collour to their Cause, hath he (and sodainely)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Disarmd againe and setled in obedience,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And without bloodshed, Lords, without the Sword</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And those Calamities that shake a kingdom:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So gently and without noyse he has performd this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As if he had don it in a dreame.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. Most certaine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He has run through a busines will much add to him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And set his vertues of with greater Lustre:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But that a man so wise as Mounseiur <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So trusted, so rewarded for his Service,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And one that built the ladder to his honour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of open, honest actions, strong and straight still,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should now be doubted!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bred</emphasis>. I know not nor I wish it not,
But if he have a fowle hart't has byn hid long,
And cunningly that poyson has byn carried.</p>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. But why a father to theis new professions?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why should he strengthen those opinions</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That all true learning much laments and greives at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And sincks the soules sweet union into ruyn?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why theis, my lords? and why in every Garrison,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unles he had an end that shot at evill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should he so strongly plant theis fire-brands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And through his powre add daylie to their nombers?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bred</emphasis>. Most sure he is suspected, strongly suspected</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But that a man of his great trust and busines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should sinck or suffer under doubts or whispers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or loose his honour by an others envy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is not faire play nor honest. The Prince of <emphasis>Orange</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Most thinck, affects him not, nor he the Prince.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That either of their angry wills should prove</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A lawful act to ruyn one another,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And not a medium of more open Justice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More equall and more honorable, step in,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Man had no powre to stand nor fall with honour.</p>

In every Princes Court highly esteemd of,</p>

And those that ever thought on your example,</p>

Dare not with comon safetie now salute ye.</p>

In men of lesser mark theis foule attempts are</p>

And often have bewaild 'em in the meanest,</p>

I make no doubt will meet your owne fault sodainely</p>

And chide yourself; grow faire againe and flourish</p>

It was not safe nor fitt to hold contention</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With any man commaunded thirtie legions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You know the Prince and know his noble nature,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I thinck you know his powre, too: of all your wisdomes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This will not show the least nor prove the meanest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In good mens eyes, I thinck, in all that know ye,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To seeke his love: gentle and faire demeanours</p>

<p>

Wyn more then blowes and soften stubborne angers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let me perswade ye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. When I am a Sycophant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And a base gleaner from an others favour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As all you are that halt upon his crutches.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shame take that smoothnes and that sleeke subjection!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am myself, as great in good as he is,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As much a master of my Cuntries fortunes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And one to whom (since I am forcd to speak it,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since mine owne tongue must be my Advocate)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This blinded State that plaies at boa-peep with us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This wanton State that's weary of hir lovers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cryes out "Give me younger still and fresher!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is bound and so far bound: I found hir naked,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Floung out a dores and starvd, no frends to pitty hir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The marks of all her miseries upon hir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An orphan State that no eye smild upon:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then how carefully I undertooke hir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How tenderly and lovingly I noursd hir!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But now she is fatt and faire againe and I foold,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A new love in hir armes, my doatings scornd at.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I must sue to him! be witnes, heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If this poore life were forfeyt to his mercy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At such a rate I hold a scornd subiection</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not give a penney to redeeme it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have liv'd ever free, onely depended</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the honestie of my faire Actions,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor am I now to studdy how to die soe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bred</emphasis>. Take better thoughts.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. They are my first and last,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The legacie I leave my friends behind me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I never knew to flatter, to kneele basely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And beg from him a smile owes me an honour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ye are wreatches, poore starv'd wreatches fedd on crumbs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That he flings to ye: from your owne aboundaunce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wreatched and slavish people ye are becom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That feele the griping yoak and yet bow to it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What is this man, this Prince, this God ye make now,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But what our hands have molded, wrought to fashion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And by our constant labours given a life to?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And must we fall before him now, adoare him,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Blow all we can to fill his sailes with greatnes?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Worship the Image we set up ourselves?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Put fate into his hand? into his will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our lives and fortunes? howle and crye to our owne clay</p>
<empty-line/>

"Be mercifull, ô Prince?" ô, pittied people!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Base, base, poore patch men! You dare not heare this;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have sold your eares to slavery; begon and flatter.</p>

When ere your politick Prince putts his hooke into my nose</p>

Here must he put his Sword too.</p>

<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. A prisoner?</p>

Even all he knowes. No letters are against ye,</p>

For those he burnt; but they have so much foold him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That his owne tongue—</p>
<empty-line/>

<p><emphasis>Son</emphasis>. My goverment of <emphasis>Barghen</emphasis> is disposd of;

<empty-line/>

<emphasis>Modesbargen</emphasis> fledd! I am glad he is scapt their fingers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now if the devill had but this <emphasis>Leidenberge</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I were safe enough. What a dull foole was I,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A stupid foole, to wrap up such a secreat</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In a sheepes hart! ô I could teare my flesh now</p>

And beat my leaden braines!</p>

You are at your last.</p>

I never got a Parasite, a Coward.</p>

I seeke the Prince or bend in base submission!</p>
<empty-line/>

Ile seeke my grave first. Yf I needes must fall</p>

And that the fatall howre is cast of <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>,</p>

Just like a strong demolishd Tower ile totter</p>

And fright the neighbour Cuntries with my murmour.</p>

My ruyns shall reach all: the valiant Soldier,</p>

Whose eies are unacquainted but with anger,</p>

Shall weep for me because I fedd and noursd him;</p>

Princes shall mourne my losse, and this unthanckfull,</p>

Shall feele and then confes I was a father.</p>

From which the envy of the Advocate</p>

How ere his mallice live to me, all hatred</p>

A member of this body politique,</p>

I honour him, and will not scorne to yeild</p>

A strict accompt of all my Actions to him;</p>

And, though my Enemie, while he continues</p>

The State, I love him and shall greive that he,</p>

When he falls from it must deserve my pitty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. This disposition in your Excellence</p>
<empty-line/>

Do's well becom you, but would wrong our iudgements</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To call one as a partner to these counsailes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That is suspected, and ev'n then when all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His dark designes and deepest purposes</p>
<empty-line/>

Are to be sifted.</p>
<empty-line/>

You are your owne disposers.—Gentlemen,</p>

<p>

I shall a while entreat ye to forbeare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The troble that you put upon yourselves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In following me. I can need no defence here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Being left among these whose grave counsailes ever</p>

Have lookd out for my safetie. 'Tis your pleasure</p>

Your Excellence may deliver what you have</p>

<p>

Observ'd concerning the <emphasis>Arminian</emphasis> faction,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What hopes and heads it had, for without question</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It found more favorers, and great ones too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then yet we have discoverd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Or</emphasis>. My grave Lords,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That it hath byn my happines to take in,</p>
<empty-line/>

And with so litle blood, so many Townes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That were falne of, is a large recompence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For all my travell; and I would advise</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That (since[168] all now sing the sweet tunes of Concord,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No Sword unsheathd, the meanes to hurt cut off,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all their stings pluckd out that would have used them</p>
<empty-line/>

Against the publique peace) we should end here</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And not with labour search for that which will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Afflict us when 'tis found. Something I know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I could wish I nere had understood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which yet if I should speake, as the respect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And duty that I owe my Cuntry binds me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It wilbe thought 'tis rather privat spleene</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then pious zeale. But that is not the hazard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which I would shun: I rather feare the men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We must offend in this, being great, rich, wise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Sided with strong frends, trusted with the guard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of places most important, will bring forth</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rather new births of tumult, should they be</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Calld to their Triall, then appease disorder</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In their iust punishment; and in doing Justice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

On three or foure that are delinquents, loose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So many thousand inocents that stand firme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And faithfull patriots. Let us leave them therefore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To the scourge of their owne consciences: perhaps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Th'assurance that they are yet undiscoverd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because not cyted to their answeare, will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So work with them hereafter to doe well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That we shall ioy we sought no farther in it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. Such mild proceedings in a Goverment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

New setled, whose maine strength had it's dependaunce</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon the powre of some perticuler men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Might be given way to, but in ours it were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unsafe and scandalous: then the <emphasis>Provinces</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have lost their liberties, Justice hir Sword,</p>
<empty-line/>

And we prepared a way for our owne ruyn</p>

When for respect or favour unto any,</p>

Of what condition soever, we</p>

Palliat seditions and forbeare to call</p>

Such mercie to ourselves were tirranie.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

That have offended, but what's the offence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And how it should be punishd, to deter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Others by the example.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bred</emphasis>. Which we will doe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And using that united powre which warrants</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All we thinck fitt, we doe intreat your Highnes</p>

(For willingly we would not say comaund you),</p>

As you affect the safetie of the State</p>

<p>1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. This is a strange cutting time.</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Let 'em cutt deep enough,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They will doe no great cure els. I wonder strangely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They carry such a gentle hand on <emphasis>Leidenberch</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That any frends come to him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. 'Has confest much,
Beleeve it, and so far they feare him not,
They would be els more circumspect.</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Pray ye, tell me,
Is there no further newes of those are fledd,—
I meane those fellow Instruments?</p>
<p>1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. None as yet,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At least divulgd abroad. But certenly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The wise States are not idle, neither at this time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do's it concerne their safeties. We shall heare shortly</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More of theis monsters.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>2 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Let's to dynner, Sir;
There we shall heare more newes.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Barnavelt &amp; Provost</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. And how doth he take his imprisonment, <emphasis>Mr. Provost</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pro</emphasis>. A litle discontent, and't please your Lordship,
And sad as men confind.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. He does not talke much?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pro</emphasis>. Litle or nothing, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Nor wrighte?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pro</emphasis>. Not any thing,
Yet I have charge to give him those free uses.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Doe you keep him close?</p>
<p><emphasis>Pro</emphasis>. Not so close, and't like your Lordship,
But you may see and speake with him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. I thanck ye.</p>
<p><emphasis>Pro</emphasis>. Pray ye give me leave; Ile send him to your Honour.

<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Now, <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>, thou treadst the subtlest path,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The hardest and the thorniest, most concernes thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That ere thy carefull course of life run through:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Master peece is now a foot, which if it speed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And take but that sure hold I ayme it at,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I make no doubt but once more, like a Comet,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To shine out faire and blaze prodigiously</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Even to the ruyn of those men that hate me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Leidenberch</emphasis>.</p>
<p>—I am sorry for your fortune.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. 'Tis a sad one
And full of burthen, but I must learne to beare it.
How stands your State?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Upon a ball of yce
That I can neither fix, nor fall with safetie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. The heavie hand of heaven is now upon us
And we exposd, like bruizd and totterd vessells,
To merciles and cruell Seas to sinck us.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Our Indiscreations are our evill fortunes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And nothing sincks us but [our] want of providence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O you delt coldly, Sir, and too too poorely,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not like a man fitt to stem tides of dangers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When you gave way to the Prince to enter <emphasis>Utrecht</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There was a blow, a full blow at our fortunes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that great indiscreation, that mayne blindnes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In not providing such a constant Captaine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One of our owne, to commaund the watch, but suffer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The haughtie <emphasis>English</emphasis> to be masters of it,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This was not well nor fitting such a wisdom,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not provident.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. I must confes my errour;
The beastly coldnes of the drowsy Burgers
Put me past all my aymes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. O, they are sweet Jewells!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that would put his confidence in Turnops[173]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And pickled Spratts—Come, yet resume your Courage,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pluck up that leaden hart and looke upon mee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Modesbargen's</emphasis> fledd, and what we lockt in him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too far of from their subtle keys to open,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yf we stand constant now to one another</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in our soules be true.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. That comes too late, Sir,
Too late to be redeemd: as I am unfortunate
In all that's gone before, in this—</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. What?</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. O,
In this, this last and greatest—</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Speake.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Most miserable.
I have confessd. Now let your eies shoot through me
And if there be a killing anger sinck me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Confessd!</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. 'Tis done: this traitor tongue has don it,
This coward tongue.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Confessd!</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. He lookes me blind now.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. How I could cursee thee, foole, despise thee, spurne thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But thou art a thing not worthie of mine anger.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A frend! a dog: a whore had byn more secreat,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A common whore a closer Cabinet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Confest! upon what safety, thou trembling aspyn,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon what hope? Is there ought left to buoy us</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But our owne confidence? What frends now follow us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That have the powre to strike of theis misfortunes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But our owne constant harts? Where were my eies,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My understanding, when I tooke unto me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A fellow of thy falce hart for a frend?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy melting mind! foold with a few faire words</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Suffer those secreats that concerne thy life,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In the Revealer not to be forgiven too,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be pluckt from thy childes hart with a promise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A nod, a smile! thyself and all thy fortunes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Through thy base feare made subject to example!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor will the shott stay there, but with full violence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Run through the rancke of frends, disperse and totter</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The best and fairest hopes thy fame was built on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. What have I done, how am I foold and cozend!
What shall redeeme me from this Ignoraunce!</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Not any thing thou aymst at, thou art lost:
A most unpittied way thou falst.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Not one hope
To bring me of? nothing reservd to cleere me
From this cold Ignoraunce?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. But one way left,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But that thy base feare dares not let thee look on;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And that way will I take, though it seeme steepe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And every step stuck with affrights and horrours,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet on the end hangs smyling peace and honour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I will on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Propound and take[174] me with ye.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Dye uncompelld, and mock their preparations,
Their envyes and their Justice.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Dye?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Dye willingly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dye sodainely and bravely: So will I:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then let 'em sift our Actions from our ashes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I looke to-morrow to be drawne before 'em;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And doe you thinck, I, that have satt a Judge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And drawne the thred of life to what length I pleasd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will now appeare a Prisoner in the same place?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tarry for such an ebb? No, <emphasis>Leidenberch</emphasis>:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The narrowest dore of death I would work through first</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ere I turne Slave to stick their gawdy triumphes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Dye, did you say? dye wilfully?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Dye any way,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dye in a dreame: he that first gave us honours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Allowes us also safe waies to preserve 'em,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To scape the hands of infamy and tirrany.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We may be our owne Justice: he that loses</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His Creadit (deere as life) through doubt or faintness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is guilty of a doble death, his name dies;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is onely pious that preserves his heire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His honour when he's dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. 'Tis no great paine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. 'Tis nothing:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Imagination onely makes it monstrous.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When we are sick we endure a hundred fitts,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This is but one; a hundred waies of torture,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cry and howle, weary of all about us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our frends, allyes, our children teadious to us,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Even our best health is but still sufferaunce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One blow, one short peece of an howre dos this,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And this cures all; maintaines no more phisitians,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Restores our memories, and there's the great cure,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where, if we stay the fatall Sword of Justice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It moawes the man downe first, and next his fashion,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His living name, his creadit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Give me your hand, Sir;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You have put me in a path I will tread strongly;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Redeeme what I have lost, and that so nobely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The world shall yet confes at least I lovd ye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How much I smile at now theis peoples mallice!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dispise their subtle ends, laugh at their Justice!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And what a mightie Prince a constant man is!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How he can set his mind aloft, and looke at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The bussings and the busines of the spightfull,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And crosse when ere he please all their close weavings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farwell, my last farwell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. A long farwell, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Our bodies are the earthes, that's their dyvorsse:
But our immortall names shall twyn togeather.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Thus tread we backward to our graves;—but faint not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Fooles onely fly their peace: thus I pursue it.</p>

Th'Appollogie he wroat so poorely raild at,</p>

(For answeard at no part a man can call it)</p>

And all his life and Actions so detracted,</p>

<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Goe to bed then,
For I must wryte, my Childe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Boy</emphasis>. I had rather watch, Sir,
If you sitt up, for I know you will wake me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Indeed I will not; goe, I have much to doe;
Prethee to bed; I will not waken thee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Boy</emphasis>. Pray, Sir, leave wryting till to morrow.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Why, Boy?</p>
<p><emphasis>Boy</emphasis>. You slept but ill last night, and talkd in your sleep, too;
Tumbled and tooke no rest.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. I ever doe soe.
Good Boy, to bed; my busines is of waight
And must not be deferrd: good night, sweet Boy.</p>
<p><emphasis>Boy</emphasis>. My father was not wont to be so kind
To hug me and to kisse me soe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. Why do'st thou weep?</p>
<p><emphasis>Boy</emphasis>. I cannot tell, but sure a tendernes,</p>

Whether it be with your kind words unto me</p>

<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>.—Thou bringst fitt mourners for my funerall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Boy</emphasis>. But why do you weep, father?</p>
<p><emphasis>Leid</emphasis>. O, my Boy,</p>

<p>

Thy teares are dew-drops, sweet as those on roses,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But mine the faint and yron sweatt of sorrow.</p>

Prethee, sweet Child, to bed; good rest dwell with thee,</p>

When most I should be man! Sweet hart, farewell,</p>

Farewell for ever. When we get us children</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We then doe give our freedoms up to fortune</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And loose that native courage we are borne to.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To dye were nothing,—simply to leave the light;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No more then going to our beds and sleeping;</p>

<p>

But to leave all these dearnesses behind us,</p>
<empty-line/>

These figures of our selves that we call blessings,</p>

Is that which trobles. Can man beget a thing</p>

That shalbe deerer then himself unto him?</p>
<empty-line/>

—Tush, <emphasis>Leidenberch</emphasis>: thinck what thou art to doe;</p>

Not to play <emphasis>Niobe</emphasis> weeping ore her Children,</p>

Sleepe on, sweet Child, the whilst thy wreatched father</p>
<empty-line/>

Prepares him to the yron sleepe of death.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or is death fabled out but terrable</p>
<empty-line/>

To fright us from it? or rather is there not</p>

Some hid <emphasis>Hesperides</emphasis>, some blessed fruites</p>

And I shalbe prevented.</p>

Nor more remember him then fitts thy fortune.</p>

Except some three or foure to watch the Castle</p>

<p>

Least he break in againe. What Company</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have ye discoverd that attends him?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sold</emphasis>. Few, Sir:
I do not thinck he has five within the fort now
Able to make resistaunce.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Let 'em be twenty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We are strong enough to fright 'em; and by all meanes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let those that stay seek by some trick or other</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To make the Bridge good, that they draw it not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If he returne upon us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sold</emphasis>. With all care, Sir.
                               [<emphasis>Exeunt.—Hornes</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Modes-bargen &amp; Huntsmen</emphasis>[177].</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. The doggs have hunted well this dewy morning,
And made a merry cry.</p>
<p>1 <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. The Hare was rotten[178];</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You should have heard els such a rore, and seene 'em</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make all hir dobles out with such neat hunting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And run at such a merry rate togeather,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They should have dapled ore your bay with fome, Sir.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. 'Tis very well, and so well I affect it</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That I could wish I had nere hunted after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Any delight but this, nor sought more honour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This is securely safe, drawes on no danger,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor is this Chace crost with malignant envy.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How sweatly do I live and laugh upon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The perrills I have past, the plotts and traynes!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And now (methincks) I dare securely looke on</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The steepe and desprat follyes my indiscretion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a blind careles foole had allmost cast me on.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Here I stand saffe 'gainst all their strengths and Stratagems:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I was a boy, a foole to follow <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To step into his attempts, to wedd my freedom</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To his most dangerous faction, a meere Coxcomb;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I have scapd their clawes.—Have ye found more game?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter 2 Huntesmen</emphasis>[179].</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. Beating about to find a new Hare, we discoverd—</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. Discoverd what?</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. Horsemen, and't please ye, Sir,
Scowt round about us, and which way still the doggs went
They made up within view.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. Look't they like Soldiers?</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. For certaine they are Soldiers; for if theis are eyes
I saw their pistolls.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. Many?</p>
<p>2 <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. Some half a score, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. I am betraide: away and raise the Boores up,
Bid 'em deale manfully.</p>
<p>1 <emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. Take a close way home
And clap your spurres on roundly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. No place safe for me!
This Prince has long armes, and his kindled anger
A thousand eyes—Make hast and raise the Cuntry.</p>
<p>                                        [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captn &amp; Soldiers</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. This was a narrow scape; he was ith' feild, sure.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sold</emphasis>. Yes, that was certaine he that ridd of by us,
When we stood close ith' brakes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. A devill take it!
How are we cozend! pox of our goodly providence!
If he get home or if the Cuntry know it!</p>
<p><emphasis>Sold</emphasis>. Make haste, he is yet unmand: we may come time enough</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To enter with him. Besides there's this advantage:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They that are left behind, instead of helping</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A Boores Cart ore the Bridge, loden with hay,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have crackt the ax-tree with a trick, and there it stands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And choakes the Bridge from drawing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. There's some hope yet.
Away and clap on spurs: he shall scape hardly
If none of us salute him. Mounte, mounte.</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Modesbargen &amp; Huntesmen</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. Hell take this hay! 'tis set on purpose here:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fire it and draw the Bridge: clap faggotts on't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And fire the Cart and all. No Boores come in yet?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where be your Musketts, Slaves?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. We have no powder, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. You have sold me, Rogues, betrayd me: fire the Cart, I say,
Or heave it into th' Moat.</p>
<p><emphasis>Hunt</emphasis>. We have not men enough.
Will ye goe in? the Cuntry will rise presently,
And then you shall see, Sir, how wee'll buckle with 'em.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. I see I am undon: the[180] hay choakes all,
I cannot get beside it.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captaine &amp; Soldiers</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Stir not a foote,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For he that do's has mett his preist.—Goe, ceize his body,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But hurt him not. You must along with us, Sir:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have an easie nag will swym away with ye,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You ghesse the cause, I am sure. When you are ith' saddle once,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let your Boores loose; we'll show 'em such a baste.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do not deiect yourself nor rayle at fortune;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They are no helpes: thincke what you have to answeare.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. Captaine, within this Castle in ready coyne
I have a thousand ducketts: doe me one curtesie,
It shalbe brought out presently.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. What is it?
For I have use of money.</p>
<p><emphasis>Mod</emphasis>. Doe but shoot me,
Clap both your Pistolls into me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. No, I thanck ye,</p>

I know a trick worth ten o'that: ile love ye</p>

And bring ye to those men that love to see ye.</p>

Away, away; and keepe your pistolls spand still:</p>

To kill himself?</p>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. 'Has don it and most desperately,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nor could strong nature stay his hand,—his owne Child</p>

<p>

That slept beside him: which showes him guilty, lords,</p>
<empty-line/>

More then we suspected.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Or</emphasis>. 'Tis to be feard soe</p>

And therefore, howsoere I movd your lordships</p>

To a mild and sweet proceeding in this busines,</p>

<p>

That nothing might be construde in't malitious</p>

And make the world believe our owne ends wrought it,</p>

Now it concernes ye to put on more strictnes</p>

<p>

And with seveerer eyes to looke into it:</p>

<p>

Ye robb yourselves of your owne rightes els, Justice,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And loose those pious names your Cuntries safeties.</p>
<empty-line/>

And sodainely this must be don and constantly:</p>

The powrs ye hold els wilbe scornd &amp; laughd at,</p>
<empty-line/>

And theis unchristian stroakes be laid to your charge.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bred</emphasis>. Your Grace goes right; but with what generall safetie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(For ther's the mayne point), if we proceed seveerely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May this be don? We all know how much followed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And with what swarmes of love this Mounsieur <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is courted all the Cuntry over. Besides, at <emphasis>Leyden</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>

We heare how <emphasis>Hogerbeets</emphasis> behaves himself,</p>
<empty-line/>

And how he stirrs the peoples harts against us.</p>
<empty-line/>

And <emphasis>Grotius</emphasis> has byn heard to say, and openly,</p>
<empty-line/>

(A man of no meane mark nor to be slighted)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That if we durst imprison <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis></p>

He would fire the Court and State-house, and that Sacrifize</p>

He would make more glorious with your blood and ours, Sir.</p>

I that nere feard an Army in the feild,</p>

A body of most choice and excellent Soldiers</p>

Can I feare them or shake at their poore whispers?</p>

I that have broke the beds of Mutenies</p>

Shall I shrinck now and fall, shot with a rumour?</p>

No, my good Lords, those vollyes never fright me;</p>

Yet, not to seeme remisse or sleep secure here,</p>

I have taken order to prevent their angers;</p>

They lou'd me both. The King of <emphasis>Swechland</emphasis> this,</p>

About a Truyce; his bounty, too. What's this?</p>

<p>

From the Elector Palatine of <emphasis>Brandenburge</emphasis>,</p>

To doe him faire and acceptable offices:</p>

I did so; a rich iewell and a chaine he sent me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Count of <emphasis>Solems</emphasis>, and this from his faire Countess</p>

<p>

About compounding of a busines:</p>

Grave <emphasis>Embden</emphasis>: theis from Citties, theis from Provinces;</p>

Petitions theis; theis from the States for places.</p>

Have I held correspondence with theis Princes,</p>

And had their loves, the molding of their busines,</p>

Trusted with their most secreat purposes?</p>

Of every State acquainted with the misteries?</p>

And must I stick here now, stick unreleevd, too?</p>

Must all theis glories vanish into darknes,</p>

And <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis> passe with 'em and glide away</p>

Like a spent exhalation? I cannot hold;</p>

Fame has too many eares and eyes to find thee!</p>

Upon this high-straind danger. O, this end swayes me,</p>

A heavy bad opinion is fixt here</p>

To some of my great Masters to beg for me.
Didst thou meane so?</p>
<p><emphasis>Daught</emphasis>. I meane, Sir—</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>.  Thou art too charitable</p>

To prostitute thy beutie to releeve me;</p>
<empty-line/>

With thy soft kisses to redeeme from fetters</p>
<empty-line/>

The stubborne fortune of thy wretched father.</p>

Be not so cruell to thy aged father
To somme up all his miseries before him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Daught</emphasis>. I come, Sir, to entreat your Company.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. I am not alone.</p>
<p><emphasis>Daught</emphasis>. My Mother will not eate, Sir.
—What fitt is this!</p>

Dare not step in. Wher's my Son <emphasis>William</emphasis>?</p>

His Goverment is gon, too; and the Soldier,</p>

O, the falce Soldier! What! wouldst thou have a husband?</p>

Goe, marry an English Captaine, and hee'll teach thee</p>

How to defy thy father and his fortune.—</p>

I cannot eate; I have no stomach, Girle.</p>

I had nere more need. When I am sett and gon,</p>

What understanding can they stick up then</p>
<empty-line/>

To fill the place I bore? None, not a man:</p>

To traffick with Great Princes? none: to deale</p>

<p>

With all the trobles of the war? None, certaine, no man:</p>

<p>

To bring in daylie treasure? I know no man;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

They cannot pick a man made up to serve 'em.</p>
<empty-line/>

Why should I feare then? doubt, and fly before</p>

To serve the uses of those men that scorne ye;</p>

'Tis time you take your ease now.</p>

An everlasting ease, I hope.</p>

Thy fruit there and my fall ripen togeather
And fortune gives me heires of my disgraces.</p>

With what I have, what honest hand in pitty</p>

<p>

Will powre out to thy wants? What noble eye</p>

Will looke upon my Children strooke with miserie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And say 'you had a father that I honourd;</p>
<empty-line/>

For his sake be my Brothers and my Sisters.'</p>

<p>

Through thousands more and those he little dreames of.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Son</emphasis>. I wonder how he got that speritt, Sir, to dye soe?</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. He was a weak man, indeed, but he has redeemd it:
There be some other I could wish of his mind.
Do'st thinck they dare doe any thing now.</p>
<p><emphasis>Son</emphasis>. 'Troth, I thinck not, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. No, Boy, I warrant thee; they make great soundes,
But mark what followes. Prethee, let's be merry,
I want it much.</p>
<p><emphasis>Son</emphasis>. I am glad to see you so, Sir.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Servant</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. I cannot be above two daies from Councell,
I know their wants. How now, what haste?</p>
<p><emphasis>Serv</emphasis>. O, Sir, ye are undon;
We have lost ye.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Ha!</p>
<p><emphasis>Serv</emphasis>. For ever lost ye.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Why?</p>

<p>    <emphasis>Enter Wife &amp; Daughter</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Serv</emphasis>. Is broken in now upon us.</p>

<p>                             [<emphasis>Captaine within</emphasis>.</p>

Wee'll force it els, and all that dare resist us
Wee'll put to th'Sword.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Open the dore: farewell, Wiffe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Goe to the French Embassadour presently;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There's all my hope. To him make knowne my misery,</p>

Wooe him with teares, with praires: this kisse; be happie.</p>

You Instrument of blood, why doe ye seeke us?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have knowne the day you have wayted like a suppliant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And those knees bended as I past. Is there no reverence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Belonging to me left now, that like a Ruffian</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rudely ye force my lodgings? No punishment</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Due to a cryme of that fowle nature?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. You must pardon me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have commission, Sir, for what I offer,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And from those men that are your Masters, too;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At least you'll find 'em soe. You must shift your lodging,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And presently: I have a charge to see ye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yeild yourself quietly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Goe and tell their Lordships</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will attend to-morrow. I know my time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And how to meet their mallice without guards.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This is the Prince, the cruell Prince your Master,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The thirstie Prince of this poore Life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Be not vext;
That will not help ye, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. I wilbe vext,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And such an anger I will fling amongst 'em</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shall shake the servile soules of these poore wretches</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That stick his slight deservings above mine.</p>

<p>

I charge ye draw your Guard off and disperce 'em:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have a powre as full as theirs.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. You'll find not;
And I must have ye with me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. And am I subiect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That have stood the brunt of all their busines,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And when they slept watcht to secure their slombers,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Subiect to slights, to scornes, to taynts, to tortures?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To feed one privat mallice am I betrayd?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Myne age, myne honour and my honest dealing</p>
<empty-line/>

Sold to the hangmans Sword?</p>

Feed your long bloody hopes and bath your angers</p>
<empty-line/>

In <emphasis>Barnavelts</emphasis> deservings; share my Services;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Let it be death to pitty me; to speak well of me,</p>

The ruyn of whole famylies. When I am gon</p>

Too late remember then and cursse your follyes.</p>

—I am ready. Farwell, Son; remember me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But not my fortune; let them cry that shall want me.</p>

Into the <emphasis>Hague</emphasis>?</p>

Let his being brought in be still conceald, and tell him</p>

As great as ever.</p>

And of more powre; his feet upon the necks
Of all his Enemies.</p>

For which the world admires you, I wish to you.</p>

Alas, what troble do's a weake old man,</p>

The bag of his deserts, too, cast behind you,</p>

Impose upon this Senat? My poore life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Which others envy makes your Instruments</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To fight against) will hardly be a Conquest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Worthie such great performers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. Mounseiur <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Tis no mans envy that hath brought us hether</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sitt as Judges on you, but your owne.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your owne late actions they have raisd a war</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against your former merritts, and defeated</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What ever then was ranckt for good and great,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For which your Enemies, those that you thought frends,</p>
<empty-line/>

Triumph, not wee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bre</emphasis>. We rather wish you could
Acquitt yourself of that for which we have
Too evident prooffes, then labour to intrap you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. I must beleeve and suffer whatsoever
Your Lordships charge me with: yet would gladly heare
What my faultes are.</p>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. Read the Confessions
Of <emphasis>Leidenberch</emphasis> and <emphasis>Taurinus</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. <emphasis>Leidenberch</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Officer reads</emphasis>. First, that the <emphasis>Arminian</emphasis> faction (of which Sir <emphasis>John
Van Olden Barnavelt</emphasis>, late Advocate of <emphasis>Holland</emphasis> and <emphasis>West Frizeland</emphasis>
and Councellor of State, was without contradiction the head) had
resolved and agreed to renounce and break the generallity and unitie
of the State.</p>
<p>Secondly, Change and alter the Religion, and to that end, without the</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Consent of the Generall States, had raysed up and dispeirsed 3000</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arminian Soldiers.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Thirdly, To degrade the Prince of <emphasis>Orange</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Fourthly, To massacre the people of the Townes which were their greatest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Enemies or offered resistaunce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Fiftly, yf that fayled, to take in assistaunce of some forreigne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Potentates, as <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis> or <emphasis>Brabant</emphasis>, delivering unto them <emphasis>Utricht,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Nunweghen, Bergen op Zone</emphasis>, and the <emphasis>Brill</emphasis>—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. And that, with others, this was <emphasis>Barnavelts</emphasis> purpose?
For so your Lordships take it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bred</emphasis>. With good reason.</p>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. Too many and strong proofes invyting us
To creadit it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. Yf you will have them such,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All truth I can bring to dyvert your Lordships</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From your determinate opinion that way</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will not remove them. Yet 'tis strange that man</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should labour to devide those Generall States</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That had no weak hand in unyting them,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis> (a name you have remembered</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When you have thought by whom you were mad happie)—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis> (alowd I dare repeat it),</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who, when there was Combustion in the State,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your Excellence, Grave <emphasis>William</emphasis> and Count <emphasis>Henrie</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Taking instructions for your Commaunds</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From one that then ruld all; the Provinces</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Refucing to bring in their Contributions</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And arguing whether the West <emphasis>Frizelander</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And <emphasis>Hollander</emphasis> had powre to raise such Tribut,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When many of the Governours stood ill</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Affected to you, all our Garrisons</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not sworne then to the Generall States but others,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which the promiscuous multitude gladly followed:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When <emphasis>Graves</emphasis> and <emphasis>Vendloe</emphasis> were held by the <emphasis>Spaniard</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And <emphasis>Nunweghen</emphasis> with violence assaulted,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Confusion with one greedy gripe being ready</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To seaze on all; then when the <emphasis>Sluice</emphasis> was lost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all in muteny at <emphasis>Midleborough</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who then rose up or durst step in before me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To doe these Cuntries service? Who then labourd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More then the now suspected <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'appease seditions and compound all Quarrells?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who pacified the Malcontents? Who taught you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To stand upon your Guards and trust yourselves?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

O, you forgettfull, all this I performd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And in the golden fagot of faire Concord</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bound safely up those strengthes which Mutenies,</p>
<empty-line/>

Corruption and homebred Traitors scatterd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Vand</emphasis>. This is a point you often choose to treat of,
And yet some part of theis good services
None will deny you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Or</emphasis>. But to ingrosse all
Would argue me your ward, should I give way too't,
And these grave Lords your Schollers.</p>
<p><emphasis>Bar</emphasis>. In the Art</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Goverment they scornd not once to be soe,</p>
<empty-line/>

Nor you to give me hearing: and if ever</p>

'Twer lawful th' unthanckfull men t'upbraid</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Once with the King of <emphasis>Britaine</emphasis> that now is:</p>

<p>

Yet let my greatest Enemy name the least</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of theis so high Imployments in which I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Treated without advantage, and returnd not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With proffitt, as with honour, to my Cuntry,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And let me fall beneath the worst aspersion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His mallice can throw on me. Besides Soldiers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So often levied by my meanes for you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which to particularize were teadious,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Two millions and five hundred thousand pounds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For which the Provinces stood bound, I wrought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Freely to be dischargd; the Townes they pawnd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To be deliverd up; and after all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Theis meritorious and prosperous travells</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

T'unyte theis States, can <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis> be suspected</p>

To be the authour to undoe that knot</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which with such toyle he fastend[190].</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Or</emphasis>. Pawse, I beseech you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And while you gather breath to fill the Trumpet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of your deserts give me leave to deliver</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A litle for the States and mine owne honour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We have heard a glorious Catalogue of your vertues</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But not one vice or slip of yours rememberd;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But I will help your memory:—who was he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That gave intelligence of my sodaine comming</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To surprize <emphasis>Antwerpe</emphasis>? They that brought the Letters</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were knowne and but from you could have no notice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of any such design. Who hinderd me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From rescuing of <emphasis>Rheinberch</emphasis> in the last Seige?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who warranted the yeilding of it up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Without necessitie to the Governour?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who was the cause no greater powre was sent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against the Enemie when he past the Rhine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tooke the Townes of <emphasis>Oldensell, Lingen, Groll</emphasis>?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To thinck of this would give a litle vent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To the windy bladder of your vanitie</p>
<empty-line/>

Which you have blowne to an unlymitted vastnes.</p>

As know myself a Prisoner. Now you perceive</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To what a desperate state your headlong Counsells</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And rash designes have brought us: to stand out now</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Were to no purpose, for, alas, they have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too pregnant prooffes against us.</p>
<empty-line/>

Confes yourself soe; my strong Inocence</p>

Not many howres since, and hundreds more;</p>

But yet, as one that's bound to honour him,</p>

I had rather have had assuraunce of his death</p>

Than so to have seen him.</p>

When every step he made met a Petition,</p>

And these, that are his Judges now, like Clyents</p>
<empty-line/>

Have wayted on him. The whole Court attended</p>

When he was pleasd to speake, and, with such murmours</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As glad Spectators in a Theater</p>

Grace their best Actors with, they ever heard him;</p>

When to have had a sight of him was held</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A prosperous omen; when no eye gazd on him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That was not filld with admiration, not</p>

As now with scorne or pitty. His rude Guard,</p>

For proofe that they contempne all such as ayme</p>

Or hope for his release (as if he were</p>

Yf you refuce it he must thinck himself</p>

Hereafter you may misse that promptnes in him</p>

rhumes, all Catharres, megroomes, verteegoes: presto, be gone!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ley</emphasis>. You must not carry it, <emphasis>Harlem</emphasis>: you are a pretty fellow and lop

And in what posture: first, how ile take my leave of him,</p>

With a few teares to draw more money from him;</p>

Brought nothing forth but desolation,</p>

Cold dewes of blood, and <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> flames hoong ore ye,</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

There is no title-page to the MS.</p>

opportunities in Captain <emphasis>Underwit</emphasis> for discursive comment. Sometimes I
have been obliged to pass over odd phrases and out-of-the-way allusions
without a line of explanation; but in the index at the end of the fourth
volume I hope to settle some difficulties that at present are left
standing.</p>
<p>The date of the play I take to be circ. 1640 or 1642. In I. 1 there is a
mention of the "league at <emphasis>Barwick</emphasis> and the late expeditions," where the
reference can only be to Charles I.'s march into Scotland in the spring
of 1639, and to the so-called Pacification of <emphasis>Berwick</emphasis>. Again, in III.
3, there is an allusion to the Newmarket Cup. Historians of the Turf say
that Newmarket races date from 1640; but this statement is incorrect,
for in Shirley's <emphasis>Hyde Park</emphasis> (V. 1),—a play licensed in 1632 and
printed in 1637,—mention is made of a certain "Bay <emphasis>Tarrall</emphasis> that won
the Cup at Newmarket." We find also an allusion to the "great ship"
(III. 3), which was built in 1637. Of Mr. Adson's "new ayres" (IV. 1) I
know very little. He brought out in 1621 a volume of "Courtly Masquing
Ayres," but published nothing later,—although, of course, he may have
continued writing long afterwards. Hawkins and Mr. Chappell are
altogether silent about Adson's achievements.</p>
<p>Gerard Langbaine tells us that Shirley left at his death some plays in
manuscript: I have little doubt, or rather no doubt at all, that Captain
<emphasis>Underwit</emphasis> is one of them. In the notes I have pointed out several
parallelisms to passages in Shirley's plays; and occasionally we find
actual repetitions, word for word. But apart from these strong proofs,
it would be plain from internal evidence that the present piece is a
domestic comedy of Shirley's, written in close imitation of Ben Jonson.
All the characters are old acquaintances. Sir Richard Huntlove, who
longs to be among his own tenants and eat his own beef in the country;
his lady, who loves the pleasures of the town, balls in the Strand, and
masques; Device, the fantastic gallant,—these are well-known figures in
Shirley's plays. No other playwright of that day could have given us
such exquisite poetry as we find in Captain <emphasis>Underwit</emphasis>. The briskness,
too, and cleverness of the dialogue closely recall Shirley; but it must
be owned that there are few plays of Shirley's written with such
freedom, not to say grossness.</p>

<p><strong>[CAPTAIN UNDERWIT, A COMEDY.]</strong></p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Act the First</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captaine Underwit and his man Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Come, my man <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, and my fathers old man <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>; reioyce,
I say, and triumph: thy Master is honourable.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Then wee are all made.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. No, tis only I am made.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. What, and please your worship?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I am made a Captaine of the traind band,[214] <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, and this
is my Commission, this very paper hath made me a Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Are you a paper Captaine, Sir? I thought more had gone to the
makeing up of a Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. They are fooles that thinke so, provided he have the favour of the
Livetenant of the County.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Which it seemes you have.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. The honour of it is more then the thing, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, since I did
not bribe the Secretarys steward or what servant else so ever hath the
government of his Lordship therein.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. This is very strange.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Not so much as transitorie wicker bottles to his Deputy
Livetenant, no fewell for his winter, no carriages for his summer, no
steple sugarloaves to sweeten his neighbours at Christmas, no robbing my
brave tennants of their fatt Capons or Chickens to present his worship
withall, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I cry your worship mercy, you sold him land the last terme; I had
forgott that.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I, that lay convenient for him. I us'd him like a gentleman and
tooke litle or nothing; 'twere pitty two or three hundred acres of dirt
should make friends fall out: we should have gone to fenceing schools.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. How, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I meane to <emphasis>Westminster</emphasis> hall, and let one another blood in Lawe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. And so the Land has parted you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Thou saist right, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, it lies betweene both our houses
indeed. But now I am thus dignified (I thinke that's a good word) or
intituled is better, but tis all one; since I am made a Captaine—</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. By your owne desert and vertue.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Thou art deceavd; it is by vertue of the Commission,—the
Commission is enough to make any man an officer without desert;
<emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, I must thinke how to provide mee of warlike accoutrements to
accomodate, which comes of Accomodo[215]: <emphasis>Shakespeare</emphasis>. The first, and
the first—</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. No, Sir, it comes of so much money disburs'd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. In troth, and it does, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>; but take out your table bookes
and remember to bring after me into the Country, for I will goe downe
with my father in law Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis> this morning in the Coach,—let me
see—first and formost: a Buff Coate and a paire of breeches.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. First and formost: Item, a Buff Coate fox and a paire of breeches
of the same Cloth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. A paire of bootes and spurres, and a paire of shooes without
spurres.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Spurres.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. A paire of gray stockins, thick dapple gray stockins, with a belt,
to be worne either about my shoulder or about my wast.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Wast.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. A <emphasis>London Dutch</emphasis> felt without a band, with a feather in't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Without a feather in't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. An old fox[216] blade made at <emphasis>Hounsloe</emphasis> heath, and then all the
Bookes to be bought of warlike discipline, which the learned call
Tacticks.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Ticktacks.[217]—If your worship would take my Counsell,
considering the league at <emphasis>Barwick</emphasis>[218] and the late expeditions, wee
may find some of these things in the North or else speake with some
reform'd Captaine, though he bee a Catholike; and it may bee wee may
have them at cheaper rates.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. 'Tis true, Thomas: but I must change the lynings of the breeches,
for I love to bee cleanly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. So you may, Sir; and have the fowling of them yourselfe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Let me see: A leading staff—</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. A leaden staffe—</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. A lead'ing staffe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>.—ding staffe. Why, a Cane is a leading staffe in a Captaines
hand.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. But I must have tassells, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, and such things.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. At the harnesse of the Carthorses there are tassells and Bells,
too, if you will.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Bells? What should I doe with em?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Ring all your companie in.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Thou would'st make me a Captaine of a Morris dance. What serve the
phifes and Drumms for, prethee?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. But does your worship thinke you shall endure the bouncing of the
Gunns? I observed you ever kept a way of at the Musters.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Thou shalt therefore every morne goe a birding about the house to
inure me to the report. By that tyme thou hast kild all my pigeons I
shall endure the noise well enough.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. But, Sir, you must have a dry Nurse, as many Captaines have. Let
me see: I can hire you an old limping decayed Sergeant at <emphasis>Brainford</emphasis>
that taught the boyes,—he that had his beard sing'd of at the last
Muster: hee'le doe it bravely.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. What must he have?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Alas, twenty pipes[219] of <emphasis>Barmudas</emphasis> a day, six flagons of
March[220] beere, a quart of Sack in a weeke, for he scornes meate; and
the kitching wench to bring the shirt to him and the only band, for
Cuffs he gets none but such as his drunkennes procures him with
quarrelling.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. No, I shall be bashfull to learne of a stranger, thou sha't goe
seeke out Captaine <emphasis>Sackburye</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. He that weares no money in his scarlett hose, and when he is
drunke is infected with Counsell?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. The very same; you shall find him at his Lodging in <emphasis>Fleetstreet</emphasis>
or in the next taverne. Give him this Letter; tell him I desire his
Companie this summer in the Country. He shall have a horse of mine,
say:—here, give him this gold, too.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I hope it is gameing gold.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. He shall read warres to me and fortification.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I can teach you to build a sconce[221], sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Beside, he is very valiant; he beate me twice when he was drunk,
but, poore fellow, I ask'd him forgivenes the next day. Make hast, good
<emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, and remember all the Tacticks.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I warrant you, Sir: I know 'em well enough.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. So, so; here's Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Richrd Huntlove, his Ladie and Mistresse Dorothy</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Rich</emphasis>. Me thinkes you looke more sprightly since you were made a
Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Oh, good Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis>, indeed my face is the worst part about mee;
and yet it will serve at the Muster.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Serve! With reverence to the title, I have seene a Generall with a
worse Countenance. It is a good leading face, and though you have no cut
ore the nose or other visible scarre, which I doubt not but you may
receave all in good tyme, it is a quarrelling face and fitt for a man of
warre.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I thanke you, sweet mistress <emphasis>Dorothy</emphasis>: I will commend you as much
when you are in the Countrey.—But doe you resolve to goe downe this
morning, Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Rich</emphasis>. By all meanes: is your sister readie? bid the Coachman make
hast, and have a care you leave none of your trinketts behind: after a
little dialogue with my scrivenour Ile returne, and then to Coach.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. But why this expedition, this posting out of towne as the Aire
were infected?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Rich</emphasis>. The[222] truth is, my sweet Ladie, we have no Exchange in
the Country, no playes, no Masques, no Lord Maiors day, no gulls nor
gallifoists[223]. Not so many Ladies to visit and weare out my Coach
wheeles, no dainty Madams in Childbedd to set you a longing when you
come home to lie in with the same fashion'd Curtaines and hangings, such
curious silver Andirons, Cupbord of plate and pictures. You may goe to
Church in the Countrey without a new Satten gowne, and play at penny
gleeke[224] with a Justice of peaces wife and the parsons; show your
white hand with but one Diamond when you carve and not be asham'd to
weare your owne wedding ring with the old poesie. There are no Doctors
to make you sick wife; no legends of lies brought home by yong gallants
that fill my Dyning roome with fleas and new fashions, that will write
verses upon the handle of your fanne and comend the education of your
Monkey, which is so like their worships as they were all of one familie.
I have no humour to provokeing meates; I will downe and enter into a
Christian diett, Madam. There is sport in killing my owne partridge and
pheasant; my Trowtes will cost me less than your Lobsters and crayfish
drest with amber greece[225], and I may renew my acquaintance with
mutton and bold chines of beefe; entertaine my tenants, that would pay
for my housekeeping all the yeere and thanke my worship at Christmas,
over and above their rents, with Turkies and Beeves of supererogation.
You may guesse I have some reason to change the aire, wife, and so I
leave you to prepare your selfe: You have my purpose and may expect mee.
                                                                [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. However he may pretend, and point at charge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which makes his stay unpleasant, 'tis his Jelousie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That strikes him into wildnes and dislike</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of all things here: he does not use mee well.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

—Where is my sister?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. In the Closet, Madam.
—I must waite upon my Ladie, sweete Captaine.</p>
<p>                     [<emphasis>Exeunt Lady &amp; Dorothy</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. This Wench has a notable witt, if I have any Judgment: I doe not
thinke but shee's in love with me. If I thought shee were not given to
be with child I would examine her abilities; but these waiting women are
so fruitfull, when they have a good turne from a gentleman they have not
the vertue of concealment: touch a Chambermaide and take a Child,
—everything workes with their soluble bodies.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Monsir Device</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Noble Mr. <emphasis>Underwitt</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I know not whome you meane, sir: he that comands the family in
chiefe, hath been honor'd with a sword and "rise Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis>" (who is
but my father in lawe[226] to a[nd?] by a former wife): for Mr.
<emphasis>Underwitt</emphasis>, whome to salute you humbled your Cloth a gold Dublet, I ken
not the wight.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Doe not you know mee, noble Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Upon even tearmes I may call your name to memorie, but if you
understand not my addition[227] it is honourable to forgett the best
friend I have.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. What's the mistry of this? Your addition? pray honour me to
know it.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. He that was Mr. <emphasis>Underwit</emphasis> is made a Captaine; you may, if you
please, take notice of his title.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I beg your mercy, noble Captaine, and congratulate your addition
of honour. It was Ignorance which, I professe, made me salute you with a
wrong preface. Now, Capt., I shall bee proud to march under the ensigne
of your favour.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Friend <emphasis>Device</emphasis>, how does thy body? I am thy vassall; servant is
for porters, watermen &amp; lacquies, &amp; is no witt neither. You preserve
your tropes and your elegancies? What fancies doe adorne to-day? If I
were a Constable I might apprehend you for suspition you had robd a
pedlar. Does this thatchd cottage head hold still in fashion? What paid
you for this dead mans hair? Where's your night rail[228]? The last time
I saw you was in <emphasis>Fleetstreet</emphasis>, when at Complement and bare to an other
gentleman. I tooke him for a Barber and I thought you by the wide lynnen
about your neck [to] have been under correction in the suds[229], sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Wee are govern'd by the Mode, as waters by the Moone; but there
are more changes in th'one than t'other. But does your Comand extend
to the Sea or the land service?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I never see the Sea in my life, sir, nor intend it.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. You are not the first Captaine that has seene no service: 'tis
time lost to travell for't when a man may bee a Comander at home. I
never traveld myselfe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. No, Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. And yet I understand garbes, from the elevation of your pole to
the most humble galosh.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Can your hanches play well in these close cut breeches? they want
but a pummell to distinguish 'em from Trouses[230].</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. O sir, there is a perfect geometry in these breeches; you doe not
observe the morality of your fancie, nor the gentile play and poize of
your Lemon, Orange or Melon: this is gentry. Why, I understand all the
curiosities of the Mode to a Mathematicall point, and yet I never
travaild in all my life for't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. These are extraordinary parts. Alas, a Captaine has but fifty or a
hundred at most to looke after, and all they have not so much witt as
your <emphasis>French</emphasis> Lacquey. And what need any travaile to instruct them? I
can teach them their motions by word of mouth: when they come to fight,
my Countrymen will retreate naturally.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Ladie and her Sister</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Now in revenge could I bee rich, but that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I would not be a prisoner to my Chamber.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

These superstitions will make women doe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Strange things sometymes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Of whome doe you thinke he should be jealous, sister?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Of Duke <emphasis>Eneas</emphasis> in the hanging.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I hope he has no suspition of my servants,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That, under the pretence of formall Courtship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To mee, should ayme at his dishonour: there's</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One that would weare my livery.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. <emphasis>Device</emphasis>?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hang him, outside! no, my husband loves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His folly and would have him the state foole,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His garbes are so ridiculous.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. What opinion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Still with a confidence of your cleere thoughts)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Holdes he of the Knight Sir <emphasis>Francis Courtwell</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That often visits us?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Sure a Noble one,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I may aske my Innocence; yet I find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Him very amorous. O my husband loves him;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He is a powerfull man at Court, whose friendship</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is worth preserving. Sister, I confesse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His nobleness and person hath prevaild</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With mee to give him still the freest welcome</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My modestie and honor would permitt;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But if I thought my husband had a scruple</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His visits were not honourable, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should soone declare how much I wish his absence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Your Mistresse and my Lady; I have some
Affaires require despatch, ile leave you to 'em.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. My witty servant!</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Most pretious Alamode, Monsir <emphasis>Device</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I blesse my lipps with your white handes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. You come to take your leave as knowing by instinct wee have but
halfe an hour to stay.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Wee are for the Countrey as fast as your <emphasis>Flanders</emphasis> mares will
trott, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. That's a Solecisme till the Court remove;—are you afraid of the
small pox?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. The less the better for a gentlewoman.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. And the greater more genty for a Cavallier. By this glove (a
pretty embroidery is't not?) you must not deprive us so soone of your
sweet presence. Why, there's a Ball to night in the <emphasis>Strand</emphasis> and
tomorrow I had a purpose to waite upon you to the pictures; I ha'
bespoke regalias[231] there, too. There will be a new play shortly,
a pretty Comedy written by a profest Scholler: he scornes to take
money[232] for his witt, as the Poetts doe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. He is Charitable to the Actors.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. It may be their repentance enough to play it.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. You must needs stay and give your opinion.
What will become of me when you are gon, Ladie?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. If your devotion catch not cold you may breath your <emphasis>Barbary</emphasis>
and visit us, where you may be confident of your welcome.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I dare as soone doubt I was Christned. But pray let us visit the
Exchange and take a trifle to weare for my sake before you goe. What
say, Madam? my owne Coach is at dore, the lyning is very rich and the
horses are very well matcht.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Alas, wee expect upon my husbands returne to take Coach
imediatlie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. But if wee see you in the Countrey you will doe us an honour?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. You invite me to my happines. I can play well o' the kittar; I
thinke your musique is but course there; wee'le have a Countrey dance
after supper and a song. I can talke loud to a Theorbo[233], too, and
thats cald singing. Now, yee shall heare my Ballet.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Did you make a Ballet?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Oh I, the greatest wit lies that way now; a pittifull Complaint of
the Ladies when they were banish'd the Towne[234] with their husbands to
their Countrey houses, compeld to change the deere delight of Maske and
Revells here for Wassail and windie bagpipes; instead of Silken Fairies
tripping in the Banquetting Roome, to see the Clownes sell fish in the
hall and ride the wild mare, and such Olimpicks, till the ploughman
breake his Crupper, at which the Villagers and plumporidge men boile
over while the Dairy maid laments the defect of his Chine and he, poore
man, disabled for the trick, endeavours to stifle the noise and company
with perfume of sweat instead of Rose water.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. This must be our Countrey recreation, too!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Francis Courtwell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Who is this?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. 'Tis Sir <emphasis>Francis Courtwell</emphasis>;
You cannot choose but know him.—This must bee
A favour, Sir, to visit us at parting.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. I came with other expectation, Madam,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then to heare this: I could receave no newes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So unwelcome. What misfortune doth conclude</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Towne so unhappie?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. 'Tis my husbands pleasure,
Affrighted with some Dreame he had last night;
For I can guess no other cause.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Could hee
Bee capable of fright and you so neere him?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. He cannot choose but know me then.—Sir, I kisse your noble hand
and shall be stellified in your knowledge.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. What thing's this that looks so like a race Nagg trick'd with
ribbands?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. He is one of my inamoratos, Sir;
They call him Mounsir <emphasis>Device</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Lady, your faire excuse.—He has, it seemes,
Some confidence to prevaile upon your liking
That he hath bought so many Bride laces.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You may interpret him a walking mirth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. He moves upon some skrues and may be kinsman
To the engine that is drawne about with Cakebread,
But that his outside's brighter.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Sir <emphasis>Francis Courtwell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. That's my name, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. And myne Mounsieur <emphasis>Device</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. A <emphasis>Frenchman</emphasis> Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. No, sir; an <emphasis>English</emphasis> Monsier made up by a <emphasis>Scotch</emphasis> taylor that
was prentice in <emphasis>France</emphasis>. I shall write my greatest ambition satisfied
if you please to lay your Comands upon mee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Sweet lady, I beseech you mussell your beagle; I dare not
trust my selfe with his folly, and he may deserve more beating then I am
willing to bestow at this tyme.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Take truce a little, servant.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Will you consider, Madam, yet how much
A wounded hart may suffer?</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. Still the old businesse;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Indeede you make me blush, but I forgive you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you will promise to sollicite this</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Unwelcome cause no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. 'Tis my desire;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I take no pleasure in a pilgrimage.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you instruct a nearer way, 'tis in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your will to save your eare the trouble of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My pleading, Madam, if with one soft breath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You say I'me entertain'd; but for one smile</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That speakes consent you'le make my life your servant.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. My husband, Sir—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Deserves not such a treasure to himselfe
And starve a noble servant.</p>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. You but pleade</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For vanitie: desist, for if I could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Forgetting honour and my modestie)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Allow your wild desires, it were impossible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That wee should meete more then in thought and shadowes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. If these shadowes, Madam, be but darke enough,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall account it happines to meet you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But referr that to opportunitie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which our kind starrs in pitty will sooner offer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To both our ioyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. But he is very Jealous.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. That word assures my victorie; I never</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heard any wife accuse her husband of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or cold neglect or Jealousie, but she had</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A confirm'd thought within to trick his forehead—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is but Justice, Madam, to reward him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For his suspitious thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Lady</emphasis>. D'ee thinke it fitt
To punish his suspition yet perswade
To act the sinne he feares?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Custome and nature make it less offence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In women to comitt the deed of pleasure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then men to doubt their chastity; this flowing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

From poison'd natures, that excus'd by fraielty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Yet I have heard the way to cure the scare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Has bin the deed; at truth the scruples vanish.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I speake not, Madam, with a thought to suffer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A foule breath whisper your white name; for he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That dares traduce it must beleeve me dead,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or my fame twisted with your honour must not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have pitty on the Accusers blood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Device</emphasis>. I will attend you in the Countrey;
I take my leave and kiss your ivory hand;
Madam, and yours. Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis>, your obliged.
                                          [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. You bless me with this promise.
—How can you, lady, suffer this impertinent
Afflict you thus?
                                       [<emphasis>Ex. Lad</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Alas, my parrat's dead and he supplies the prattle: ith' spring
and fall he will save me charge of phisick in purgeing Melancholy.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. If you dare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Accept a servant, Ladie, upon my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Comends, I should present a kinsman t'ee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who sha'not want a fortune nor, I hope,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A meritt to possesse your faire opinion.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You doe not say he is hansome all this while, and that's a maine
consideration. I wod not have a man so tall as a Mast, that I must clyme
the shroudes to kisse him, nor so much a dwarfe that I must use a
multiplying glass to know the proportion of his limbes. A great man is a
great house with too much garret and his head full of nothing but
lumber: if he be too round agen hees only fitt to be hung upp in a
Christall glasse. The truth is the man I love must please me at first
sight; if he take my eye I may take more tyme to examine his talent.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Do you but grace him with accesse and aske your owne fancie,
Ladie, how you can affect him. Ile not despaire if he were cur'd of
modesty, which is the whole fault in his behaviour; but he may passe
without contempt.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. That modestie is a foule fault.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captaine Underwitt</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Come away, Cosen; Sir <emphasis>Richard's</emphasis> come and calls for you; the
Coachman is ready to mount. Noble Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis>, because you may not
loose breath, you may call me a Captaine, please you, a Captaine o' the
train'd band.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. 'Tis very certaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. I congratulate your title, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. If you come into the Countrey you shall see me doe as much with my
leading staff as another.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. You wonot thrash your men?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. If I did 'tis not the first time I ha thrash'd. If I find my
Souldiers tractable they shall find me but a reasonable Captaine.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Richard [and] Lady</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Rich</emphasis>. Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis>, I am sorrie the violence of my affaires wonot
let me entertaine you to my wishes. Pray honour us with your presence in
the Countrey, if you can dispence with your employments, when I shall
satisfie for this haste of my departure.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. I shall attend you, Sir, and present a kinsman of mine to this
virgin Ladie: he is like to be Master of no narrow fortune. It was my
busines at this tyme only to prepare his accesse.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Rich</emphasis>. He shall have my vote for your sake, Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis>. Come,
Madam.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Fr</emphasis>. Ile waite upon you to the Coach and take my leave.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Sweet Mistresse <emphasis>Doritye</emphasis>.</p>

<p><emphasis>Capt</emphasis>. Hum—hum—Where's the gold?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Here, Sir; one, two, three, fowre, and five.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Thou hast learnd the Cinque pace[235], <emphasis>Tho</emphasis>: is the gold weight?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I hope so, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Hum—into the Country;—thou hast a horse, too?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Not about me, Sir, but he is ready, all but brideling and
sadling, at our Inne, Captaine. My master sayes you shalbe troubled with
no horse but his.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Why, is he lame?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. What? <emphasis>Truehunt</emphasis>, the black nag with three white feete? he lame?
You meane that I ride upon my selfe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Hum,—'make hast as you will preserve the reputation of your true
friend and servant:'—so, so—Comend me to him, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>; I wonot faile
to visit him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. You may demand the Nag, if you ask for <emphasis>Humfrey</emphasis> the Ostler, by
the same token he has bin there this foure dayes and had but one peck of
provender.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Enough I wonot faile, I say. Farewell, honest <emphasis>Tom a
Lincolne</emphasis>, farewell: comend me to the traind band.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Pray doe not fall a drinking and forgett it: bu'oy[236], noble
Captaine.
             [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Mr. Courtwell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. My expectation of the Lawz well mett!</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I am glad to see you, Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Is thy sight perfect?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy poring upon statutes and booke cases</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Makes me suspecte. But dost thou thinke to bee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A Dominus factotum on the Bench,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And be a Civill Lawyer?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. You are merry.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Tis more then thou hast been this twelvemonth: th'ast</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lost thy Complexion with too much study.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, thou shalt be an heire and rule the rost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of halfe a shire, and thy father would but Dye once;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come to the Sizes with a band of Janisaries</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To equall the Grand Signor, all thy tenants,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That shall at their owne charge make themselves fine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And march like Cavaliers with tilting feathers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gaudy as <emphasis>Agamemnons</emphasis>[237] in the play:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

After whome thou, like <emphasis>St. George</emphasis> a horseback</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or the high Sheriff, shall make the Cuntrey people</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Fall downe in adoration of thy Crooper</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And silver stirrup, my right worshipfull.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A pox a buckram and the baggage in't!</p>
<empty-line/>

Papers defil'd with Court hand and long dashes,</p>

Or Secretarie lines that stradle more</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then <emphasis>Frenchmen</emphasis> and lesse wholsome to the Client.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is thy head to be fild with Proclamations,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Rejoynders and hard words beyond the <emphasis>Alchemist</emphasis>[238]?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be ruld, and live like a fine gentleman</p>

And then thou art fitt Companie.</p>

I wou'd you saw your Errour that place all</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

I should degenerate too much and forfet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My education.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Education! he has gott a tune:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I doe not thinke but thou wilt leave thy law</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And exercise thy talent in composeing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Some treatises against long haire and drinking</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That most unchristian weed yclipt tobacco;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Preach to the puisnes[239] of the Inne sobrietie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And abstinence from shaveing of lewd Baylies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That will come shortlie to your Chamber doores</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And there with reverence entreat your worships</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come forth and be arrested,—precious tappoles!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I wo'd not willingly despaire of thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For thy Lands sake and cause I am thy Countreyman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

One generous Vagarie, and thou wer't wise,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would breake somebodies hart within a sennight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then th'art Lord of all. Have but the grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To dine wo' mee at taverne and ile tell</p>

In <emphasis>Essex</emphasis>: if he live heele purchase <emphasis>Romford</emphasis>;</p>

If he die sooner then the towne's our owne;</p>

Spend but an acre a day and thou maist live</p>

Till all the world be wearie of thee. Betweene</p>

Us two, what thincke you of a wench?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Nothing.</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

I know a hundred Leverets[240], things that will</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bound like a dancer on the rope and kiss thee</p>

Into thy naturall complexion:</p>

A sinner that shall clime thee like a squirrell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. And crack me like a Nutt. I ha no kernell
To spare for her sweet tooth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. That was a metaphor: hee's not desperate!</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Buoy, my deere Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Wy, farewell, Countreyman:
I may live yet to witnes thy conversion.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter a Footeman</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. How does my uncle?</p>
<p><emphasis>Fo</emphasis>. He desires presentlie
To speake with you at his lodging.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Ile attend him.</p>
<p>                          [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>[SCENE 2.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captaine Underwit and Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. And hast thou been carefull of all those things I gave charge
to be provided?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. There is a note of the particulars.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Tis very well done, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>.—Let me see: Imprimis—</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. The Captaine wonot faile to be w'ee, sir. He was not at his
lodging; and inquiring at the <emphasis>Horne</emphasis> tavern, I heard he had been there
with two or three Cittizens that ow'd him mony.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. That he owde mony to.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Tis all one, I thinke, Sir; for when Captaines have not pay, the
creditors may pay themselves. Here they said he did mollifie the hart of
the haberdashers and dranke himselfe a little mellowe ere they parted,
which gave me some hope I might find him ere night at the <emphasis>Divell</emphasis>,
where indeed I fetcht him out of the fire and gave him your Letter.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. And the gold too?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. That was the first word he read; if you did not write it in text
he could not have found it out so soone. His eye was no sooner in the
inside but his arme flew out with an open mouth and his very fingers
cryed "give me the gold"! which presumeing to be weight he put in his
hocas pocas, a little dormer under his right skirt; and so takeing his
word to come downe and turning over your horse to him, with caution not
to be drunk and forgett your worship, I tooke my leave and went about
my Inventorie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Theis things are very right, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>. Let me see now the bookes
of Martiall discipline.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I bought up all that I found have relation to warr and fighting.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. That was weldone.—Item: <emphasis>The Sword Salve</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. This I conceiv'd to have the vertue of <emphasis>Achilles</emphasis> speare: if you
bee hurt you need goe no further then the blade for a Surgeon.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. The <emphasis>Buckler of Faith</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. You had the sword before, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. A <emphasis>Booke of Mortification</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I, Sir, that is a kind of killing which I thought very necessary
for a Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Item: the <emphasis>Gunpowder Treason</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Booke of Cannons</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I wod not lett any shott scape mee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. <emphasis>Shakespeares</emphasis> Workes.—Why <emphasis>Shakespeares</emphasis> Workes?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I had nothing for the pikemen before.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. They are plays.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Are not all your musterings in the Countrey so, Sir? Pray,
read on.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. <emphasis>Bellarmines Controversie</emphasis> in six tomes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. That I took upon the Stationers word, who had been a pretty
Schollar at Paules; for the word <emphasis>Bellarmine</emphasis>, he said, did comprehend
warr, weapons and words of defiance. Ill words provoke men to draw their
sword, and fighting makes an end of the busines; and all this is
controversy. Pray, goe on, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Two paire of Tables.—Tables for what?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Oh, sir, for ticktack. You know it was in my note, which though I
doubted at first, yet considering you were newly made a Cap: I conceiv'd
it was fitt you should learne to sett and or[d]er your men.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Tacticks, man: thou didst mistake, they are bookes of warre.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. You cannot know these from bookes as they are painted,
I warrant you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Why, dost thou thinke theis will make a Souldier?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Not of themselves, Sir, and therefore I provided: please you
read on, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. <emphasis>Parsons Resolutions</emphasis> and <emphasis>Felthams Resolves</emphasis>[241].</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. All is nothing I knew, Sir, without resolution.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Summa totalis three and twenty poundes nyneteene shillings and
sevenpence.—Thou hast undone mee.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. If you doe not like the pennyworths tis but the charges of my
selfe and a horse agen to <emphasis>London</emphasis>. I will lose but the three odd pounds
19s and 7d: it may be you doe not understand these Authors: when the
Captaine comes he will expound 'em to you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. What a Coxcombe have I to my man! but I dare not be angry with
him. Well, carry 'em into my study, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p>                                  [<emphasis>Ext. Tho</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Device</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Most honor'd Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. My compleat Monsier <emphasis>Device</emphasis>, this is a grace to us. You come to
visit your Mistres my Cosen. As if by instinct she had knowledge of your
    [<emphasis>Enter Ladie and Sister, &amp; Dorothy</emphasis>.
approach, she is come to meet you.—Shall I never get opportunitie with
that shee waiter! If I gett her with Child my man <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis> shall marry
her.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Sir, the Captaine is new alighted.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Gett a bottle of sack up to my Chamber presently.</p>
<p>                            [<emphasis>Ext. [Underwit &amp; Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. You are a gentleman of your word.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. And such a gentleman is to be trusted, Madam.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. He is an Infidell that will breake his word with a Ladie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I suspect, servant, you have many Mistresses.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Not I, by this white hand. I must acknowledge there are some
Ladies in the Court in whose eyes and opinion I am favour'd. I cannot
obscure my selfe from their observation; but my heart with contempt of
all other endeerement is only devoted to your service.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Is't not a charge to dresse your selfe with such variety of
Ribbands every day?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Is that your scruple? Tis the Mode to express our fancie upon
every occasion; to shew the turne and present state of our hope or
feares in our Affection. Your colours to an understanding Lover carry
the interpretation of the hart as plainely as wee express our meaning
one to another in Characters. Shall I decipher my Colours to you now?
Here is Azure and Peach: Azure is constant, and Peach is love; which
signifies my constant Affection.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. This is very pretty.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Oh, it saves the trouble of writing, where the Mistres and Servant
are learned in this amorous blazon. Yesterday I wore Folimort, Grisdelin
and Isabella: Folimort is withered, Grisdelin is absent, and Isabella is
beauty, which put together express I did wither or languish for your
absent beautie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. But is there any reason for theis distinctions?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Yes, Lady: for example, your Follimort is a withred leafe, which
doth moralise a decay: your yellow is joy, because—</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Why, yellow, Sir, is Jealous.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. No, your Lemon colour, a pale kind of yellow, is Jealous; your
yellow is perfect joy. Your white is Death, your milke white inocence,
your black mourning, your orange spitefull, your flesh colour
lascivious, your maides blush envied, your red is defiance, your gold is
avaritious, your straw plenty, your greene hope, your sea greene
inconstant, your violet religious, your willow forsaken.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. We may then comitt a solecisme and be strangely interpreted by
such curious expounders in the rash election and wearing of our colours,
I p[er]ceave.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Tis pitty but there should be some bookes for our instruction in
this art.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Your Hierogliphick was the <emphasis>Egiptian</emphasis> wisdome, your <emphasis>Hebrew</emphasis> was
the Cabala, your <emphasis>Roman</emphasis> had your Simball or impresse; but they are now
obsolete, your embleme trite and conspicuous, your invention of
Character and Alphabeticall key tedious and not delightfull, your motto
or rebus too open and demonstrative: but the science and curiosity of
your Colours in Ribbands is not only instructive but an ornament and the
nearest Comentator of Love; for as Love is entertain'd first by the eye,
or, to speake more plaine, as the object affected is tooke in first by
these opticks which receive the species of the thing colord &amp;
beautifide, so it is answerable to nature that in the progresse of our
passion we should distinguish by our eye the change or constancy of our
affections in apt and significant colours.</p>
<p>_Sis. _You have tooke paines to study this learn'd heraldry.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. It is the onely gentile knowledge or philosophie in the world. I
will undertake to open any man or womans hart.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Heaven forbid!</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Tell the most secret imaginations and designes conclude every
passion and scruple, if they be carefull to observe the artificiall
method of their colours.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Why, this may be a way of fortune telling too.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. You say right, Lady: phisiognomy and chiromancy are but trifles;
nay, your geomancie meere coniecturall, the execution of your schemes
circumstantiall and fallible, but your quaint alamode weare of your
fancie more then astrologicall.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Tis a kind of Divinitie.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. You say very true, Madam, and comes neere to propheticall if the
minds of Ladies and gentlemen were elevated to the just and sublime
consideration.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. What paines he takes to be ridiculous!</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. This gentleman has a notable fancie and talkes poetically.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Yes, yes; he can write verses.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Well, I have read Authors in my dayes and knew the length of the
poets in my tyme too, which was an hexameter and which a pentameter, but
the wits are not as they have been—right and straite.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Why, <emphasis>Doroty</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Why, because wind is the cause of many things; now if the wind bee
not in the right corner tis the ill wind our proverbe speakes of that
blowes nobodie good; for when vapors and wind flie into the head it
cannot be in two places at one time: and that's the reason your men of
most wit doe seldome love a woman.—But here comes my Master and Sir
<emphasis>Francis</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Richard and Sir Francis, and Mr. Courtwell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. This is a double honour to us, <emphasis>Sir Francis</emphasis>. I shall want
language, but not a friendly hart to entertaine you and your noble
kinsman. What my exquisite Cavalier <emphasis>Device</emphasis>!—tis to no purpose I see
to remove into the Countrey to save charges and be quiet; the whole
Citty will come hither if I stay. I have no stomack to my kn't.</p>

<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. My vote is for him.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>.—I like not the induction of this rivall.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. He studies now the law,
And thats the high way to preferment, Sister.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Indeed it is the high way in which some
Deliver up their purses. He may clime
To scarlet, but that he has too good a face.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Sir, I hope—</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Troth, do not, Sir,—I meane, trouble yourselfe:
He is too bashfull to prevaile upon
Your spirited mistres!</p>

Your presence was unexpected in the Countrey.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. Twas my ambition with some intents</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To serve you, sir. Please you vouchsafe your privacie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I bring Affaires are worth your entertainement:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have rid hard.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. What Cavallier's this, Uncle?</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. He is the inventor of new proiects, cosen,
They say, and patents; one that lives like a moth
Upon the Common wealth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. He lookes like one.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ric</emphasis>. You will excuse me, gentlemen.—Make much of Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis>, Madam.</p>
<p>                                          <emphasis>Ext. [Sir Richard and Engine</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. Weele leave my Nephew and your sister, Madam,
And take a turne i'th garden.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You may be confident.</p>
<p>           [<emphasis>Exeunt Sir Francis, Lady, and Dorothy</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>.—I doe not like the fancie in his hat;
That gules is warre and will be ominous.</p>
<p>                              <emphasis>Ext. [Device</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. The gentleman's turnd statue! blesse me how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He staires upon me and takes roote, I thinke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It mooves, and now to earth is fixt agen;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Oh, now it walkes and sadly marches this way.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is't not a ghost? heele fright me. Oh, sweet sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Speake if you can and say who murderd you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It points at me: my eyes? ungentle eyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To kill so at first sight! Ile have my lookes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Arraigned for't and small <emphasis>Cupid</emphasis> shall be judg,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who for your sake will make me blind as he is.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. Ladie—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. The man's alive agen and has</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A tongue! discretion guide it; he but sent</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His soule forth of an arrand; tis returnd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now wee shall have some sentences.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. Such are the strange varieties in love,
Such heates, such desperate coldes,—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. No more winter, and you love me, unlesse you can command the
colepits; we have had a hard tyme on't already for want of fuell.</p>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. I'me all turnd eares and, Lady, long to heare you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But pressing to you doubt I am too neare you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then I would speake, but cannot; nought affordes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Expression, th'Alphabet's too poore for wordes:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He that knowes Love knowes well that every hower</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Love's glad, Love's sad, Love's sweet—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. And sometymes sower. Theis wordes would goe well to a tune; pray
letts heare you sing. I doe not thinke but you can make me a ioynture of
fower nobles a yeare in Balletts, in lamentable balletts; for your wit I
thinke lies tragicall. Did you make the <emphasis>Ladies Downefall</emphasis>[242].
You expresse a passion rarely, but pray leave
Your couplets and say something in blanck verse
Before you goe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. Before I goe? breath not that killing language:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There is no sunne but in your eyes, and when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I once take leave of those celestiall beames</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I meet with darkenes in my habitation;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where stretch'd on sable ground I downe shall lay</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My mournefull body, and with folded Armes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Heare sadder noats uppon the <emphasis>Irish</emphasis> harpe[243]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And drop division with my brinish teares.[244]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. This must be lamentable musick sure!</p>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. But I have found an art to cure this wound,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I with fancies pencill will so draw</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your picture in the table of my hart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your absence shall but like darke shadowes stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To sett you of and see you, Lady, better</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then Love will lett me when I looke upon you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Could this be true and meant, sweet sir, to me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I should be kinder then the gentlest spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That warms the world and makes fierce beasts so tame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And trees to swell themselves to cheerefull greene;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More jocund then the proudest quire of birds,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What ere they be that in the woods so wide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Doe sing their merry catches.—Sure he does</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But counterfeit.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. Oh, now I see that Love
Is sweet as flowers in their fragrant birth,
Gentle as silke, and kind as Cloudes to Earth?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. One rime more and you undoe my love for ever. Out upon't! pedlars
<emphasis>French</emphasis>[245] is a Christian language to this. I had rather you should
put me a case out of <emphasis>Litleton</emphasis>. They say you are a pretty Lawyer.</p>

<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Not by tenn thousand, Sir. Confest: but I have no mind to come to

at <emphasis>Westminster</emphasis>, teaching men the Statutes. No, no, I wo'not marry a
Judge.</p>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. Why, Lady?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. They are casuall things and men that hold such strange opinions.</p>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. Lady, you may be misinform'd: <emphasis>Astraea</emphasis></p>

<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Farewell, Sir:</p>
<empty-line/>

You are in love with a barrd gown, not beauty;</p>
<empty-line/>

If you will be my learned Counsell, leave it</p>

<p>[SCENE 3.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Francis and Ladie</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. It is no honour, Sir, if arm'd with so</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Much eloquence you overcome a woman.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I blush to say I love you now too much;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I wish you would release what your sweet charmes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Won from my tongue; I shall repent my promise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. Make me not miserable after so much blessing.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, Madam, tis on honourable tearmes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Since not upon the first attempt but after</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A tedious seige in to your faire love you give up</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What shall enrich us both. It were a sinne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To feare you can retract what both our lipps</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have seal'd, and loose a happines so neare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And so secure. Your husband holds his pleasure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of early hunting constant, and when he</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pursues the tymerous hare to morrow morne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>Cupid</emphasis> will waite to bring me to <emphasis>Elizium</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your bed, where every kisse shall new create us.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. You must be wise in your excuse, to quit
His importunitie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. Leave that to me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I weare not worth the name of him that serv'd you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To loose my glorious hope for want of such</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A thinne device. In your thought wish me prosper,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I am fortifide against the power</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of fate to seperate us; and when thou art</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Within the amorous circle of my armes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We will make lawes to love; teach him new motion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or chaine[247] him with the cordage of his haire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like a tame thing, to walke, and watch our pillow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And be our pleasures Centinell.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. I see</p>
<empty-line/>

My husband; tis not safe he should observe us:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be wise and constant.    [<emphasis>Exit Lady</emphasis>.</p>

So I am sailing now to my owne <emphasis>Indies</emphasis>,</p>

And see the happie Coast, too: How my wings</p>

<p>

To the common wealth, preventing the diseases</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which some unwholsome haire breeds in mens heads,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It will be worth our agitation, Sir;</p>
<empty-line/>

Of other able men that would be glad</p>

To heare my Doggs, for a new Maidenhead, I.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Twas for these sports and my excess of charge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I left the towne: besides the Citty foggs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And steame of Brick hills almost stifled me;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This Aire is pure and all my owne.</p>

To have been a man of peace, I meane a Justice.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nature has made him fit for both alike.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hee's now at charge to keepe a Captaine Schoolemaster;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He might have sav'd the qua[r]teridge of his Tutor</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If I had been his Clarke: and then the income</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That broken heads bring in, and new yeares guifts</p>

And sweates, and cannot—</p>

Of a rare Surgeon.</p>

My presence cannot serve him. Morrow, wife:</p>

<p>

To chaffer Maidenheads with me. I must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Confesse I can affect the foole upon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good tearmes, and could devise a plott to noose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My amorous woodcock, if you privatlie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Assist me and dare trust me with some Jewell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of price, that is not knowne, which shalbe faithfully</p>

Expect this friend: I needes must hide my blushes.</p>

When they are hors'd. I tremble to consider</p>
<empty-line/>

What I have promis'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Tremble to meet a Ghost!
You are more fearefull then a Virgin, Madam.
Why this setts me a longing; but ile watch:
This is the timerous world of flesh and blood.

What doe you meane? retire for heavens sake!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My husband is not gone, I heare his voice yet;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This rashnes will undoe my fame for ever</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should he returne.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. How's this?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

"Returne for heavens sake! my husband is not gone:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I heard his voice; this will undoe my fame!"</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It was my wife, and this is sure my bed chamber.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. (<emphasis>looking forth</emphasis>.) I have undone my selfe; it is my husband.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. My forehead sweats: Where are you, Madam?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whome did you talke too or take me for? ha! Asleepe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alreadie, or doe I dreame? I am all wonder.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Madam,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. You may kill him and please you, sweet heart;
I cannot abide a Blackamore.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. How's this, wife?</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Helpe, helpe, deare husband, strangle him with one
Of my Lute strings; doe, doe, doe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. If shee be a sleepe she was not us'd to talke thus:
She has some hideous dreame. She spake to me, to;
Whom should I strangle, sweet hart, with a lute string?</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. The King of <emphasis>Morocco</emphasis>, I thinke.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Tis so, she dreames. What strange Chimeras wee
Doe fancie in our sleepe! I were best wake her.
Madam, Madam!</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. O Murder, Murder!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Sweet heart, Madam, wake!</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Whoes that?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Tis I.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis>? Oh you have delivered me
From such a dreame I quake to thinke upon't.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. I must confesse you frighted me at first.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Dorothy</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>.—My Master come back? if he had found the [sic] Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis> here!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. How now? art thou frighted too?</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Frighted, quoth a! Oh, Madam, the key of the Closet quickly. I
must have some Cordiall water for Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis>; I feare this fitt will
kill him.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Alas, good gentleman! make hast.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>.—His appearance would betray all: I thus prevent it.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Nay, sweet hart, you sha'not leave me till I ha told</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What a cruell Dreame I had. Methought a king</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of Blackamores was in love with me, and haveing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By flattering Courtship drawne me to his bed chamber,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With my consent or force swore to enjoy mee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I knew not by what reasons to divert</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Ravisher, but told him that I heard</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thy voice, and bid him if he lov'd his life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Retire, for thou wouldst deere revenge my honour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But he pursueing me, I cry'd out Murder!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At which sad noise methought I saw thee enter,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, having nere a sword, I counselld thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To strangle him with a Lute string, for which cruelty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of mine, me thought he threw an Arrow at me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which, if thou hadst not wak'd me as thou didst,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Would as I slept with my strong feares ha killd me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. This was the King of <emphasis>Morocco</emphasis>: well, I'me glad
I came to take away thy fright.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. But, sweet, you left me with a resolution
To hunt this morning. Have you done already?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. The theeves prevented me.
My Stable has been rob'd to night; two geldings
And my roane Nagg are vanished.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. How?</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Nay, doe not thou vexe:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have sent hue and cry that may oretake 'em.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But come, Ile leave thee to my glasse,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And visit Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis> now shees return'd.—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    [<emphasis>Enter Dorothy</emphasis>.</p>
<p>How does our Noble guest?</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Hees pretty well: he has voided one stone since
And now finds ease.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Tis well: attend your Mistres.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. O, wench, I had almost undone my selfe,
Come o'tother side, reach me that peticote;
Ile tell the storie as I make me ready.</p>

<p>[SCENE 2.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Device, Sister</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Ist possible you can talke thus and be no travailer?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I have traveld in my fancie, Ladie, and with the Muses, and do for
my recreation of witt compose some wonders in verse, poeticall essaies,
as once upon the report of a heate that was in <emphasis>Egipt</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Lets heare 'em.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. <emphasis>In Countreys I have been</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Under the Equinoctiall, where I have seene</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

The Sunne disperse such a prodigious heat</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

That made our sive-like skins to raine with sweat.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Men would have given for an Ecclipse their lives,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Or one whisper of Aire; yet each man strives</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

To throw up grasse, feathers, nay women, too,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

To find the wind: all falls like lead, none blew.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

The Dogstarre spits new fire till't came to passe</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Each eye became his neighbours burning glasse.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Leane men did burne to ashes presentlie,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Fatt men did wast to leane Anatomye;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Young womens heat did gett themselves with child,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

For none but they themselves themselves defild;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Old women naturally to witches turne,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

And onely rubbing one another burne.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

The beasts were bak'd, skin turnd to crust, they say,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

And fishes in the River boild away.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Birds in the aire were rosted and not burn'd,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

For, as they fell downe, all the way they turn'd</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Most excellent!</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I have seene Larkes in that motion at fire
With an Engine of packthread perpendicular.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. What would they have given for a shower in those Cuntries?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Now you talke of a Shower you shall heare
Another coppie of Verses that I made
Of a mighty raine which fell once in the <emphasis>Indies</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. That you made? If you will venture your lungs let me heare more
impossible stories to passe away the tyme.</p>
<p>_De. <emphasis>Heaven did not weepe, but in its swelling eye</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Whole Seas of Rhume and moist Catarrs did lie,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Which so bespauld the lower world, men see</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Corne blasted and the fruit of every tree;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Aire was condenst to water gainst their wish,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

And all their foule was turn'd to flying Fish;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Like watermen they throng'd to ply a fare,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

As though it had been navigable Aire.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Beasts lost the naturall motion of each limbe,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Forgott to goe with practiseing to swime:</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

A trout now here you would not thinke how soone</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Taken and drest for th'Emperour o'the Moone,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

The fixed Starres, though to our eyes were missing</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Wee knew yet were by their continuall hissing.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Weomen were mermaides sailing with the wind,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

The greatest miracle was fish behind:</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

But men were all kept chast against their wish,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

And could comitt but the cold sin of fish</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. And that synne would puzzle all the Civell Lawyers in the
kingdome. Sinns of the flesh they are perfect in; they know well enough
what belongs to Adultery and simple fornication, but you would much
improve and oblige the practise of the Court, if you could bring this
sinne of fish under the Commission. But now, I hope, the raine is over
we shall have faire weather.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Now I can tell you, Lady, what a strange frost was in one part of
the world—</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I shall cry out fire if you doe; I had rather have some discourse
to keepe me warm still.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Or how the whole world was troubled with the wind Collick.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. No more Earthquakes, I beseech you. Some frends of myne lost a
great deale of land the last terme, and for ought I know tis never like
to be recover'd. Why, all these verses you have honourd me to heare were
translated out of <emphasis>French</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. You say very right, Lady.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. No, no; they are out of <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis>, as I remember.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I thinke it be out of <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis>, indeed.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Or else the <emphasis>Italian</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Troth, I know not which very well.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. And yet you made 'em! Some gentlemen have the faculty to make
verses and forgett what language was the Originall: tis Alamode, I
confesse, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Thers the mischiefe in poetry: a man might have told 200 lies in
prose upon his owne name, and never miscaried.—But, leaving these rude
rymes, Ladie, how do you like the novice that Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis> comended.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Mr. <emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Is he not a pretty Chrisome[249]? I could not choose but laugh to
observe in what rurall deportment he came to salute you, that should
have made his address in theis postures.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Tis enough, sir; I apprehend what you would doe. The truth is,
touching that thing in black, I doe not love him.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I know't; tis impossible.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Why is't impossible? The man's a pretty indifferent meaning man,
but I must have one of a more active spiritt. No, no, the man's a
Coward.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. He lookes like one.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I put him to't, he dares not fight; and he that expects my favour
to so high a degree as marriage must be none of my lord Maiors
whifflers[250]; he must be valiant in Armes. I am not taken with a ring
or Caskanet, as some avaritious Ladies; he that presents me with the
sword of his rivall is more welcome then all the silken soft natur'd six
hundreds a yeere, that will be baffeld in their best clothes and goe
downe into the Country every Vacacon like Atturneys to be beaten against
next terme and get damage by it, but I forget some affaires that
concerne me. I take my leave. Your deserts upon me are eminent and many,
and for all your noble services I—will promise you nothing: you
apprehend me?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. O, sweet Lady, tis too much.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I am so weary I can stay no longer w'ee.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. You make mee over happie.—So, so; the matters done. I may write
my friends. Hum: well thought upon! I shall leave her joyes without any
bound to entertaine me if I first beat this foolish rivall of mine and
present her with his sword. She assures me he dares not fight: it shall
be so. Thus with one baffling and disarming him I shall secure my
Mistresse and get the reputation of a fighting Cavallier, which may save
me many a knock hereafter among men of strong faith that shall heare how
much honour I have elsewhere taken upon the ticket.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>[SCENE 3.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captaine and Underwit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Stand right to your files, make even your rankes, silence!
Front to the right hand.
As you were.
To the right hand about.
By the left hand.
As you were.
Rankes to the right double.
Rankes as you were.
Rankes to the left double.
Midlemen to the right hand double the front; as you were,—to the left,
—double the front; middle-men to the right entire [or[251] by division]
double the front; files to the right,—to the left,—to the right hand
countermarch,—to the right,—to the left,—wheele about—</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Ran tan: enough,—you must not wast your lunges</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Too much at once. March faire and make a Captaine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When these words of Command are rotten (rooted?) wee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Will sowe some other military seeds.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You beare[252] a braine and memory.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I hope so.</p>
<p>[<emphasis>Cap</emphasis>.[253]] And now you are chose a Captaine for your Countrey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You must give good example to your Soldiers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cherish nature after exercise:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You must drinke sack, sack is a fortifier.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, wee'le to the taverne.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. With all my heart.</p>
<p>    [<emphasis>Enter Mr. Courtwell</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Here's Mr. <emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis>: lett's take him with us.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. My costive Countrey man? hee's an Anabaptist: he wonot drinke,
and yet kist the Cupp of last night, me thought, when his Mistres—
drank to him: wee'le try. How ist, my man of mortall breeding?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. My man of warre, trebonn.—Your servant, Captaine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Why, this was spoke like one of us; canst doo't</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Agen? thy voice is more authentick, soundes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As I have heard a Cavalliers in taverne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or like the merry master of the <emphasis>Dragon</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Small <emphasis>Neptune</emphasis>, that controlls the rich Canaries,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When he Comaunds the Tritons of his cellar</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

'Skud, and bring wine, you varlotts, with a flavour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For my Nobilitie.' Wee were conspiring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To goe to'th taverne.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Ile make one, gentlemen, to wash away some melancholy.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Spoke boldlie, like an <emphasis>Argonaute</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I am not now in <emphasis>London</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Upon a hall day marching with the puisnes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Twenty on's in a teame, to <emphasis>Westminster</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In our torne gownes, embroiderd with <emphasis>Strand</emphasis> dirt,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To heare the Law.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Is not thy father dead, thou talkst so well?
How I was cosend in thee: come away.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Here's my man <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Now the Newes, Sir <emphasis>Tristram</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Oh the Gentleman is mad.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. What gentleman?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Why, Mr. Engine that did faint last night.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. With feare of being hang'd for his projections.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. My Uncle told me of him.</p>
<p>_Cap. Let him to <emphasis>Bedlam</emphasis> then; what makes he here?
Clean straw and a good whip are held restoratives.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. He walkes and talkes the madliest; twenty midwives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are nothing to him, he drownes all their noise.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

His tongue is twenty ring of Bells, and yett</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He seemes so merry.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Engine</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. Save you, gentlemen, gallants, Cavalliers. How farre travell you:
me thinkes you are very finely accomodated. Are you a Doctor, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. No, but I can tell you how to purge, and please you.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. You say very well. Troth, gentlemen you must pardon me: cry you
mercy, your name is Captaine <emphasis>Underwit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Yes, sir, but my mother came of the <emphasis>Over-muches</emphasis> by the <emphasis>Peake</emphasis>.
She broke my father's hart, and Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis> buried her: things must be
as please the starres.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. What thinke you of the blazeing starre in <emphasis>Germany</emphasis>? according to
<emphasis>Ptolmy</emphasis> tis very strange. Does the race hold at <emphasis>Newmarket</emphasis> for the
Cup[254]? When is the Cocking, gentlemen? There are a parcell of rare
Jewells to be sold now, and a man had money. I doe meane to build a very
fine house next summer and fish ponds. What did you heare of the new
play. I am afraid the witts are broke; there be men will make affidavit
that [they] have not heard a good jest since <emphasis>Tarleton</emphasis>[255] dyed. Pray,
may I crave your name, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. My name is <emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis>, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. In your eare; I have a cast of the best Marlins[256] in England,
but I am resolv'd to goe no more by water but in my Coach. Did you ever
see the great ship?[257]</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. I have been one of twenty that have dind in her lanterne.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. It may be so; she is a good sailer. But ile tell you one thing: I
intend to have the best pack of hounds in <emphasis>Europe</emphasis>; Sir Richard loves
the sport well. And then if I can but find out the reason of the
loadstone I were happie and would write <emphasis>Non Ultra</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. The philosophers stone were better in my opinion. Have you no
project to gett that?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. That has startled him: I doubt this fellow does but counterfeit.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. What thinke you of the Dromedary that was to be seene at the back
side[258] of the <emphasis>Bell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. I have seene a stranger beast.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. So have I; I have seene you before now, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. Why then, ile tell you: the strangest beast that ever I saw was an
Ostridge that eate up the Iron mynes. But now you talke of birds I saw
an Elephant beat a Taylor in the fenceing schoole at his owne weapon.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. The <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> needle?</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. He did out eat him in bread, and that was miraculous. I have seene
a Catamountaine[259] once; but all was nothing to the wench that turnd
round and thred needles.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Troth, sir, I thinke you have turnd round, too, and are not
setled yet.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. Now you talke of setling I knew a gentleman, that was borne to a
good fortune, sold all his land, went to sea in a <emphasis>Hollander</emphasis>, was taken
by the <emphasis>Dunkirke</emphasis>; at seaven yeares end stole away in an <emphasis>English</emphasis>
botome; after that saw both the <emphasis>Indies</emphasis>; for all this was taken by a
<emphasis>Turks</emphasis> man of warre, put into the Gallies, and for ought I heare by
credible report is not setled yet.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Sure he is a great scholler; a man cannot understand him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. His braines are out of tune.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. Now you talke of Musick theres no man in the world loves musick
better then I,—ile give you the reason: I have been deafe almost this
halfe yeare, and it came with a cold sitting up a primero.</p>
<p><emphasis>Co</emphasis>. Now you talke of the cold it puts me in mind of the new device of
fire for brewing and bakeing. Had you no hand in the project?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Againe hees startled: come, he shall to taverne with us and
confess all. If he do not strip his soule stark naked to us, say I am no
fortune teller.—Please you to honour our society: we are going to
indulge at the taverne hard by.</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. You shall comand me, sir. Oh the Neats tongues and partargoes that
I have eaten at Stillyard, but of all things in the world I do not love
a black catt: next a brewers cart, there's nothing will stay a man so
much in the night as a Constables. One word before you go, and I beseech
you give me your opinion cleerely: was not the <emphasis>Morocco</emphasis> Ambasadour a
very fine gentleman for a pagan?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Yes, surely, and the lead mines in <emphasis>Darbishire</emphasis> hold still for
the Allom businesses. But come; will you walke, Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. I do use to goe a foote sometymes but when I ride; and then I must
confesse there is no striving with the streame. You were in <emphasis>London</emphasis>
lately: they say the people are more affected to beare baiting then in
former tyme.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. There are some a late are drawne like beares to the stake; but
for your owne part the gout and the grand pox are all one to you. What
price beare[s] meat in the shambles?</p>
<p><emphasis>En</emphasis>. Flesh rises and falls as it us'd to doe, sir; but a Countrey life
is the best when all's done. What thinke you of a bridg from <emphasis>Lion</emphasis> key
to <emphasis>Flaunders</emphasis>? You may guess I talke at randum, gentlemen; but you must
not interpret all foolish discourse a distemper of the braine: Lords
would take it for a <emphasis>Scandalum Magnatum</emphasis> and your Ladies would bee angry
too.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Sir Francis and Lady</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Now you talke of Ladies—</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. By no meanes, Mr. <emphasis>Engin</emphasis>; that gentleman loves you not. Come,
ile bring up the rere. Where's <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>?</p>
<p>                 [<emphasis>Exeunt Underwit, Captain, Courtwell and Engine</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Ile follow, sir.—I would give my fower marks a yeare that I
could talke like that mad gentleman. Hee's here and there and
everywhere. How will his tongue run when his Coggs are oild; theile
drench him!    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. Although I mist a happines, I applaud
Your nimble wit that securd both our honours.
You have an excellent Instrument too o' your gentlewoman.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Oh she deliver'd to the life how you</p>

Were troubled with the Stone. At first I did</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beleev't my selfe, and thinke of the sad consequence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But tyme is pretious now: although our Starres</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have not been yet propitious to our meeting</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile try my art to night to make 'em shine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With happie influence on our Loves.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. Most excellent Madam, how?</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Ile not engage
Your visit to my chamber, since the first
Prov'd so unfortunate, but come to youres.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. This night? wonot your husband be at home.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Yes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. You enjoy but one bed.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Without witchcraft, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I have a stratageme to delude my husband</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And all his jealous waking eyes, a plott</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That cannot faile if you dare but expect me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. I grow immortall with my hopes and fancie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

More than the worlds most pretious Empire in</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Our first embrace. I should runne back into</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An Infant once agen, and by degrees</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tyme grow up to meet so vast a happines.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ages in expectation spent were poore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And easy sufferings weigh'd against this triumph!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Methinkes I am not man but something of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A more exalted essence: humane nature</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Hath not capacity to understand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And owne theis spatious blessings.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. No more rapture;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But with the confidence of a lover spread</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your equall thoughts, and in your heart and armes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Prepare an entertainement for that guest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That hath no life or name but what you give.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A kisse! and leave our soules to thinke upon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The joyes this night attend us.</p>

Do not tire now; tis downehill all the way.</p>

<p><strong>[SCENE 1.[260]]</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    [<emphasis>Captain,[261] Underwit, Courtwell and Musicians,
    discovered in the Tavern</emphasis>.]</p>
<p><emphasis>Capt</emphasis>. Come, my <emphasis>Apollos</emphasis>, my <emphasis>Orpheuses</emphasis> or my <emphasis>Bacchus</emphasis> his
Minst[rels], which, to leave poeticall expressions, in broader phrase
is Taverne fidlers, some of your new tunes, my Masters; doe you heare?</p>
<p>1. Do you meane Mr. <emphasis>Adson</emphasis>'s[262] new ayres, Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. I, Sir; but they are such phantasticall ayres as it putts a Poet
out of his witts to rhime to them; but let mee heare.</p>
<p>                                            1 <emphasis>Play</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Capt</emphasis>. No, I doe not like that.</p>
<p>                1 <emphasis>Play againe</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Capt</emphasis>. Nor that. (<emphasis>Play againe</emphasis>)—No, no, no, neither.</p>
<p>1. An't please your Worship, Mr. <emphasis>Capt</emphasis>., our Boyes can singe songs
to these.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. No, no, saveing your presence, your Boyes have nothing,
sarreverence,[263] but Love songs, and I hate those monstruously, to
make thinges appeare better then they are, and that is but <emphasis>deceptio
Visus</emphasis>, which after some embraceings the parties see presently what
it is.
                                               <emphasis>The Musique Playes</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    (<emphasis>Hee sings and reeks and fillips all the time
    with his finger, then sayees</emphasis>:)</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. I, I, this thumping tune I like a life; a Song, a Song to it!</p>
<p>        _One Singes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

         This Song.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>The Juice of Spanish squeez'd Grapes is It</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    That makes a dull Braine so full of witt;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    The Lemonades cleere sparkling wine</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    The grosser witts too, doth much refine.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    Then to bee foxd[264] it is no crime,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    Since thickest and dull Braines It makes sublime.</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    The Stillyards Reanish wine and Divells white,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    Who doth not in them sometimes take delight?</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    If with Mimique Gestures you'le keep you from sadnes,</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    Then drinke lusty Clarett twill put you in Madnes;</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    And then to settle you no hopes in Beer</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

    But wholesome Potts of Scotch ale though its deere</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. But looke you, Child, you say the Divells white in your Song. You
have beene ill catechiz'd, Boy, for a <emphasis>White Divell</emphasis> is but a poeticall
fiction[265]; for the Divell, God bless us, Child, is blacke.</p>
<p><emphasis>Boy</emphasis>. No, Captaine, I say white wine at the Divell.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. That's true; thats a good Boy, indeed. <emphasis>Underwit</emphasis>, lend mee a
Peice to give these harmonious men there. And now begon, my Masters,
without noise, for I will have no more fiddle-faddle for my money, no
tunes of supererrogation after the Musicall Bill is paid.</p>

<empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p>[SCENE 2.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. They are all drunke already, and such Confusion in their heads
and tongues, my master kisses the next man and calls him Mistres
<emphasis>Dorothy</emphasis>; Mr. <emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis>, possest with the spiritt of defiance to
<emphasis>Cupid</emphasis>, is ready to beat him for being in love; my Projector dead drunk
in a Chaire, and the Captaine peepeing into his mouth like a tooth
drawer and powring downe sack which he feeles not, but his chapps shut
againe like a spring lock till he returne with a key to open his teeth,
to poure in the next health.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Courtwell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. My Cloake and sword, Drawer.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Tis here, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Thou art a pretty fellow; here's half a Crowne, say I am
gone <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. You are pretty well.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Captaine and Underwit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. What shalls doe with him; this Engine burnes like <emphasis>Etna</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Throw him into the River.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Hee's able to mull the <emphasis>Thames</emphasis> well, for my owne part would
Mistresse <emphasis>Dorothy</emphasis> were here to open her files.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Did you not name a woman. I will have no mention of any thing
that's female.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. May not a man talke of Sack?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Sack is a soveraigne medicine.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Oh very Soveraigne.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Is it not <emphasis>hic et hec</emphasis> sack, both for he and she. Stay, is my
Countryman gone? come hither, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>; do you thinke I am drunke?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Truly, Captaine, I cannot tell.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. You cannot tell? there's your ignorance. Drink is a vice I am as
little given to as another man, for I doe abhorre it in my selfe. I do
wonder how any reasonable man can be drunk; therefore every wise man
take Counsell and example by me, and he may see very plainely what an
odious thing it is; for you must follow your leader, and vertue, which
is an Antient—</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Vertue an Antient?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. I, an Antient old gentlewoman that is growne very poore, and
nobodie knowes where she dwells very hard to find her out, especially
for a Capt.; you will find it very difficult for a Livetenent. But wee
will endeavour the best wee can; you see my courses, I have travel'd to
find her out, and I could never yet see her at a baudihouse.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Who is to be seene at a baudihouse? to the right hand countermarch.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. He talkes of vertue, sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Vertue? she never comes there; why do you thinke she should be
there, Captaine?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Why, because she is an old gentlewoman and might keepe the house.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Alas, Captaine, Mistris <emphasis>Vertue</emphasis> is poore and leane.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Nay, then she is not fit to be a baud, but tell me did you ever
see her, or if so did you ever doo't with her?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. No, but twas none of my fault; I know not what I may do in time
when she understands the wordes of Command.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. He does not meane Mistris <emphasis>Dorothy</emphasis>: but, Captaine, I would faine
know the reason why your baudes are so fat still.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. A plaine case: they lie fallow and get hart, then they keepe
themselves so in health and so soluble with stewd prunes; and then
sipping of sack is a great matter to fatten 'em. But they are as good
people as a man shall keepe company withall, and bring up the young
gentlewomen so vertuously. I came into one of their houses tother day
for a carreere, and I found the baud sick upon her death bed, very
religious and much given to repentance for those poore sins she had
comitted. When she had taken order for her soule, she told me the young
gentlewoman I look'd for was in the next roome; and desiring her upon
her blessing to give me content, she turnes herselfe to the wall and
gives up the ghost very privatly, because she was loth to trouble us.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. By your relation theis appeare to be very good people. What if we
went to visit one of these Matrons? I have a great mind—</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Wy, now you speake like an understanding soldier, and one that
may come to something in the end. Lett us therefore march on.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. March on to <emphasis>Venus</emphasis> Warres.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. For you know, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, that the Spider and the Bee, the Spider
and the Bee, do both—something, but in troth I have forgott what tis.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Tis no matter what; let us goe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Goe? no more but goe? though I be a Captaine, if I be not chosen
in this imployment—</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. What, then, Captaine?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Why, then—I cannot goe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Very right; but wo' not those young gentlewomen you talk'd of
give a man something to make a man afraid of pepper upon occasion?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. You will be prating so long till I breake your head for
pretending to that which you have not, sirra.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Alas, I never had it in my life.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. What's that, Captaine?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Wit, I talke of wit.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>, Who has any wit? does my man offer to have wit?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Nay, take no offence at it, for I meant none to either of you
by this sack. Drawer, give me my oath, cannot you drinke without wit?
cannot you game without wit?</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. And yet by your favour the gamesters are cald the wits now.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Tis no wit to cozen; confederacy and dishonesty will doo't
without wit. Ile iustifie it: do not you know the receit of Cozenage?
take an ounce of knavery at the least,—and confederacie is but so many
knaves put together,—then you must take a very fine young Codling heire
and pound him as small as you can.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. And what then, Captaine?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Why, then you must cozen him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. But which way?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Which way? Why, which way you will: is not cozen him enough? thou
art a pretty fellow, ile talke with thee. Thy name's <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>; take
heed, I say still, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, of being drunke, for it doth drowne the
mortall soule; and yours cannot swim, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>,—can it?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Not as I know, Captaine; if it scape fire tis as much as I
looke for.</p>
<p><emphasis>Within Eng</emphasis>. Oh—oh—</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. What's that?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Tis Mr. <emphasis>Engine</emphasis> recovered from his dead sleepe.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. D'ee heare, Captaine, for all this I have a great mind to a wench,
and a wench I must have if there be one above ground. Oh <emphasis>London,
London</emphasis>, thou art full of frank tenements, give me <emphasis>London</emphasis>. Shall we
wheele about yet?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Give you <emphasis>London</emphasis>? Wo'nott <emphasis>Cheapeside</emphasis> serve your turne, or the
<emphasis>Exchange</emphasis>?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Thomas</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Oh, gentlemen, Mr. <emphasis>Engine</emphasis> is surely bewitch'd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. What, what's the matter? bring the witch and Mr. <emphasis>Engine</emphasis>
before us.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. He does vomit the strangest things yonder.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Did not I say, murder will out?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I thinke he has eaten and drunke nothing but Monopolies, and too
hard to be digested they come up againe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Within Eng</emphasis>. Oh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Harke, I must hold his head.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Did not I tell you something would come out?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Pins, pins, they lay across his throat. I told you he was
bewitch'd. Heyday! cards and dice, out with 'em, the Divells a gamester
and paies the box soundly—Now, now, now.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Whats that?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Tis something clammy,—now,—oh, tis sope!</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Sope? give a man leave to wash his mouth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Does not the lyme burne his throat, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Alas, poore gentleman, something now agen is ready to strangle
him; out with em,—hides, hides,—it was the hornes stuck in his gullett.</p>
<p><emphasis>Within</emphasis>. Oh—</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Well straind; what a foule stomack he has! open your mouth,
Mr. <emphasis>Engine</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Throw downe a pottlepot.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. I have, sir, and it has come up full of medium wine; if you have
any charity come and helpe me to hold his head; now agen!</p>
<p><emphasis>Within</emphasis>. Oh, oh, oh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. This is very strange, Captaine; the man is certainely enchanted.</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. Master, master, tis <emphasis>Shrovetuesday</emphasis>[267] and the prentices are
pulling downe <emphasis>Covent Garden</emphasis>; the Brickes come as whole out as if he
had swallowed Cherristones. Hey! will you take Tobacco in the Roll? here
is a whole shiplading of <emphasis>Bermudas</emphasis> and one little twopenny paper of
berrinas, with a superscription 'To my very loving friends the
Custome-house.'</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. Put up that for a relique, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, and open it upon high dayes
to clear the sore eyes of our <emphasis>Spanish</emphasis> Marchants. <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>, no more,
but call the Drawer, an understanding Drawer and one that writes
orthographie.</p>
<p>    [<emphasis>Enter Drawer</emphasis>.</p>
<p>—Sirra, I charge you set a padlock upon that Chamber doore; there is a
dangerous fellow must be brought to his purgation. And looke all the
goods that he hath vomitted be forthcomeing, while we discreetly goe and
enforme the Magistrates.—At your perill, sirra, at your perill seale up
the Doore; and do you pay the reckoninge.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. Sir <emphasis>Richard</emphasis> is a Justice. There's your money, and yet wee need
not pay; the gentleman hath left enough for the Reckoning in the next
Roome.</p>
<p><emphasis>Un</emphasis>. I ha made him fast, you are very welcome, gentlemen. All's paid in

To impart, you need not feare this place; the trees</p>
<empty-line/>

And hedges will not listen. What's the business?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I hope your phlegmatick stock of verse is spent.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Why then in prose, the worst that I can speake in,
I doe not love you, Lady.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. How? you ha not
Traind me thus farr to tell me that?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. You are</p>

Of all your sex the poorest emptiest trifle,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And one with whome tis most impossible</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I ere should change Affection; theres nothing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To invite me too't, not so much as that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wee call a seeming reason, upon which</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

All Love is built, seeming, I say, not it,</p>

<p>

Your witt thus, but it needes no Comentator,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not by the Author, tis so very plaine;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But to despise me most of all the sexe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is something oversaid. Though I affect</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No flattery, I hate uncivill Language.</p>
<empty-line/>

You do not meane to quarrell, now you have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Betraid me to the feilds, and beat me, Sir?</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>

Then that Red Cowes complexion? Why the Divell</p>
<empty-line/>

Do you thinke I should dote upon your person?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That thing when she is stroak'd gives milke.</p>

<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. By that</p>
<empty-line/>

I understand all this revenge, because</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You thinke I did neglect you. Pray, sir, tell me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tell me seriouslie, put the Case that I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should love you now, could not you love agen?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. In troth I thinke I could not.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You do but thinke.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Nay, ile bind it with an oath before the parish,
And when I have given my reasons, too, the Clarke
Shall praise me fort and say Amen.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. What reasons?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I shall be very loath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To say your eyes are twinckling Starres agen,</p>

<p>

Your lipps twin cherries and out blush the rubie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your azure veines vye beauty with the Saphire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or that your swelling breasts are hills of Ivory,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pillowes for Jove to rest his amorous head,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When my owne Conscience tells me that <emphasis>Bunhill</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is worth a hundred on 'em, and but <emphasis>Higate</emphasis></p>

<p>

Compar'd with 'em is Paradice. I thanke you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile not be vext and squeez'd about a rime</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or in a verse that's blanke, as I must be,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Whine love unto[268] a tune.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. This all your feare?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. No, I doe feare to loose my tyme, my businesse,
And my witts too, jolting them all away
To waite on you in prouder Coaches.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Is this all?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. To spend my selfe to nothing and be laugh'd at</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By all the world when I shall come at last</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To this reward for all my services,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To bee your lay Court Chaplaine and say gravely</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A hastie grace before your windowes breakfast.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. But how</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Came you thus cur'd? You were a passionate</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(I may say) foole, in hope you will deserve it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What phisick tooke you that hath thus restor'd you?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. A little sack had power to cure this madnes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I hope you are not sober yet, the humour
May change when you ha slept.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Ile rather stick
My Eyelids up with Sisters[269] thread and stare
Perpetually.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Then you may see me agen.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I thinke I sha'not, unless it be to wonder,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When you are in the Ivie bush, that face</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Cut upon Tafata, that creame and prunes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So many plums in white broth, that scutcheon of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pretence powderd with ermines. Now I looke upon't,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With those black patches it does put me in mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of a white soule with sinns upon't, and frights me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How sell you grapes? Your haire[270] does curle in bunches;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You[r] lipps looke like the parsons glebe, full of</p>
<empty-line/>

Red, blew and yellow flowers; how they are chopt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And looke like trenches made to draine the meadowe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. This rudenes
Is beyond the manners of a gentleman.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I cannot helpe it, and I hope you thinke so.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I am confirm'd that now I am forsaken,
But if your passion have not drownd all reason
I pray let us part civilly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. With all my heart; I dare then take my leave, to[o].</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Whoe's there?</p>

<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Behind that tree?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. You have no plott to accuse me for a rape?
Twas at the worst but felony, for cherries
That look'd as they had been a fortnight gather'd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I know youle bring me home in Curtesie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Not I, I wo' not trust my selfe; and you
Will hardly meet a worse to interrupt you.
Fare you well, Ladie.—Do you see that Bull?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. That is a happie beast</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Why happie, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. He writes no verses to his Mistresse, is</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Not cosend nor forsworne to gett her favour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bestowes no rings nor empties his Exchequer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To appear still in new rich suites, but lives</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Free o' the stock of Nature, yet loves none.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Like the great <emphasis>Turke</emphasis> he walkes in his Seraglio,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And doth command which concubine best pleases;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When he has done he falls to graze or sleepe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And makes as he had never knowne the Dun,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

White, Red or Brindled Cowe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You are unmanly.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Nay, I know you will raile now; I shall like it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Call me a scurvy fellow, proud and saucie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

An ill bred, crooked Clowne; ile here this rather</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Then live upon your pitty. And yet doe not;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For, if you raile, too, men that know you can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dissemble, may beleeve you love me, and</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tis not my ayme.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You are a fine man!</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I am in my best clothes?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I perceave
That tis truth now what the world saies of you,
And yet tis strange.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. 'Twere strange it should be otherwise.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You give your tongue a licence, nor will I hope</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your malice should spare me abroad that have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So prodigally abus'd a Ladies fame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That deserv'd nobly from you; but you men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Care not whose name you blast with a loose character,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So you maintaine your pride of talke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Howe's this?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is confess'd I have talk'd in my tyme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And talk'd too much, but not too much of you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For I but seldome thought of such a woman:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For any other—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Nay, sir, I am satisfied;
You can talke your pleasure.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Have I not done it, too?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Yes, by your own report, and with a lady
So much in vertue and in birth above you;
And therefore I expect not—</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Stay; this moves me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I never tooke a pleasure yet to lie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Ladies fames, or ever thought that sport</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Lay in the tongue. Such humours are for men</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That live by brothell offices: let me know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Who hath traduc'd me to you thus, he shall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Be knowne no more.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Ile not be guiltie, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of any murder; when we meet agen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And you in better humour, I may tell you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So farewell, <emphasis>Gondarino</emphasis>,[271] nothing's lost</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When you turne <emphasis>Woman Hater</emphasis>.    [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. She has vext me.
If we make Matrimony after this rate,
The Divell is like to dance at our wedding. Ho!</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Device</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Hee's here,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Alone too, and the place most opportune.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How shall I beginne?—Mr. <emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis>, do you love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Any friend of mine?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Not to my knowledge, Sir; I should be sorry.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Do not you love a gentlewoman?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. If she be a friend of yours ile take the first
Occasion to neglect her for your sake.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. It will become your wisdome and your safety.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. What mischiefe have done to your face?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. My face?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. You looke so scurvily; come hither, thou</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

New Monster, with more feet then a Caterpiller;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What tyme a day ist? you that move upon</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So many wheeles, say, Monsier, are you not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A walkeing Clock? I have a mighty mind</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To see you tooke a peeces.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I doe not like this.—
You wo'not put me, sir, together againe.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I wo'not take the paines. Why do you smile now?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. At your conceite to thinke I was a Clock:
I am a watch, I never strike.—Hee's valiant.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. You have pretty colours there; are these your Mistresses?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. If you did know the mistery you would applaud 'em.
Have you read <emphasis>Livre de blason</emphasis>? What meane you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I will bestow 'em, sir, upon some forehorse?
They will become a countrey teame rarely.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Mor bleu!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Why, you dare fight, it seemes, and I was told</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You were no Cavellier, a very dreame [droane?]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A wedg for men to breake their swords upon.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I shall never trust fame agen for your sake.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Thou never cosendst me.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I was never so illiterate in man.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. For I did ever thinke thou durst not fence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But at a complement; a glittering vapour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A thing of clothes and fitt for chambermaides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To whet their witts upon, but now resolve</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Either to have your skin flead of or fight wo' me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For troubling my present meditations.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Why, sir, if you be serious I shall quit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That prejudice you have upon my valour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Looke you, sir, I can draw, and thus provok'd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I dare chastise you, too. Cause I was merry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I was not bound to feed your spleen eternally</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With laughter; yet I am not ignorant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

What an advantage, sir, your weapon gives you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In length.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Wee'le change; why, this is honour in thee.</p>
<p>  [<emphasis>They measure and Device getts both weapons</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Now, sir, keepe of.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Th'art not so base?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I never cosen'd you, do you remember?
These two will guide me on the rope.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. You meane to dance, then?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Yes, the Canaries,[272] but with quicker tyme
Then you, I hope, can follow: thus I begin.
Fa, la, la, &amp;c.    [<emphasis>Excurrit</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. What a heathen Coward's this? how the rogue tripps like a fairie
to the towne with 'em! He has been a footman, sure; I have not aire
enough to overtake him, and twill be darke presently. If I loose the
sight on him ile search the towne, and if I find him not there, pursue
him with hue and cries and after hang him.</p>

A spie upon our actions, tir'd with waiting,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is drowsie gone to bed, about whose pillow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Night hath hung all her wings and set up tapers</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As if the Day were timerous like a Child</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And must have lights to sleepe by. Welcome all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The houres that governe pleasure, but be slow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

When you have blest me with my wishes. Time</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And Love should dwell like twins; make this your bower</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And charme the aire to sweetnes and to silence.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Favour me now and you shall change your states;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Time shall be old no more, I will contract</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With Destiny, if he will spare his winges</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To give him youth and beauty, that we may</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Find every minute a fresh child of pleasure.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Love shall be proud to be no more a boy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But grow to perfect strength and bold consistence[273];</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

For when too Active Lovers meet, so happie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As wee, whose equall flames light to embraces,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Twill be no weight to number many yeares</p>
<empty-line/>

In our delights and thinke all age a blessing.</p>

But language is to narrow to expresse</p>
<empty-line/>

What I expect, tis fitt my soule retire</p>

Till she present her selfe; and, if it can</p>

Measure my hop'd for ioyes with thought, prepare</p>

To entertaine the happines.</p>

<p>[SCENE 5.]</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Sir Richard and his Lady abed. Enter Dorothy with a Light</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. I have set already my designe a moveing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To take my Captaine <emphasis>Underwit</emphasis>, who in wine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was late more feirie upon me. I'th meane tyme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I cannot choose but laugh at the device</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Wee have to cheat my Master; sure the Divell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is a great friend to women that love men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He doth so furnish us with quaint inventions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Presently after supper she began</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Her fitt othe toothach, and did counterfeit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So naturally; but since she went to bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She almost rav'd by turnes:—I heare her at it.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Oh—oh, whoe's there?</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Tis I forsooth, I heard you groane and I
Have not the hart to sleepe. Shall I watch by you?</p>
<p>_La. Oh, no, no, no; get you to bed, make fast the Chamber;
I cannot endure the candle.</p>
<p>    [<emphasis>Dorothy towards the dore putts out the Candle and returnes</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Deare hart be patient.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. I, you have your homilies of patience, but if you had my paine
twould make you wild. Oh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Ile send for the <emphasis>french</emphasis> toothdrawer in the morning.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Oh, there is no rack nor torture like it. What shall I do? I shall
never sleepe agen.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Which tooth ist?</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>.—The sweet one you may be sure which troubles her.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. This, this, O that there.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. They are happie that are old and have no teeth.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Oh, take heed, now it shoots up to my head.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Thou dost make my head ake with the noise.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. If you knew what I suffer your head would ake indeed. I must rise
and walke in the Chamber; there is no remedy.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. You will catch more cold.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Oh, no, no, deere life, do not crosse me; and you were in my
torment you would rise and trie any thing for a little ease. It cannot
be worse; the paine sure came with a cold, and who knowes but an other
cold may cure me.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. I prethe come to bed agen.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. So, so, do not troble me; I am now in some little ease; its a
heavenly thing to be goeing.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Dost heare?</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Your noise will bring my paine back agen; if you knew what a
vexation it were for me to speake, You wo'not put me too't so. If you
doe talke I wo'not answere a word more, oh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Well by this no light ile to <emphasis>London</emphasis> tomorrow.</p>
<p>           [<emphasis>She takes Dorothy by the hand and exit</emphasis>.</p>
<p>Now do I see it is possible that a womans teeth should be as
troublesome as her tongue.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Oh, oh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. I cannot choose but pitty her, that any woman should hold so much
paine in a hollow tooth.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>.—If my Mr. touched with so much compassion should rise and force
me to bed with him, I must not cry out a rape; tis at the worst on my
side but fornication in my owne defence.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. I prethe come to Bed.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Oh, oh, oh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. The musick at a convocation of Catts upon a witches upsetting is
the spheres to this Catterwalling. I will thrust my head into the
pillow, as <emphasis>Dametas</emphasis>[274] did in a bush when the beare was a comeing,
and then I shanot heare her.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Oh, this is a kind of Purgatory for sins of the flesh. If she
should fall asleepe with the tother knight it is not possible I should
hold out till morning; that which would fright away an Ague would put me
into a feare, I shall ha the toothache indeed with counterfeiting; I
have knowne some men caught the stammers so; my gums begin to murmure,
there is a feare all over my flesh, she will stay so long, and then—-</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri. coughs</emphasis>.—Uh, uh!</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. Oh, oh!—Ile shift places to shew more distraction; at the worst
my noise shall be within his reach; it may give her notice to returne
too.

This furious love is a strange pilot. Sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where are you? ha! asleepe! can any dulnes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That is not Death possess a gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So valiant in desires, when he expects</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To meete his Mistresse? How I blush to raise him!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was I not worth thy waking expectation?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Farewell; yet something that [like?] a charme that's fastned</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To my poore hart restraines me. Inke and paper!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile leave him a short monument of this shame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And my neglected Love.    [<emphasis>Writes</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He knowes my hand: farwell, forgetfull Lover.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                                          [<emphasis>Exit</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. What? have I slept? some witchcraft did betray</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My eyes to so much darkenes; yet my dreame</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Was full of rapture, such as I with all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My wakeing sence would flie to meet. Me thought</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I saw a thousand Cupids slide from heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And landing here made this their scene of revells,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Clapping their golden feathers which kept tyme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

While their owne feet strook musike to their dance,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As they had trod and touched so many Lutes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This done, within a Cloud formd like a Throne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

She to whom love had consecrate this night,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My Mistresse, did descend and, comeing toward me,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My soule that ever wakes, angrie to see</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My body made a prisoner and so mock'd,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Shook of the chaines of sleepe, least I should loose</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Essentiall pleasure for a dreame. Tis happie;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I will not trust my selfe with ease and silence,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But walke and waite her comeing that must bless me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Forgive me, you bright starres, and do not frowne</p>

That I have not attended as became</p>

<p>

One that must live by your kind influence.</p>
<empty-line/>

Not yet appeard? She did comand I should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With confidence expect her. Ha! what's here?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

This Character, was not visible before.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<emphasis>That man's too much compos'd of phleame</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>

Will loose his Mistress for a Dreame</emphasis>.    [<emphasis>Reades</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Tis her's, I know't; she has been here, oh fatall!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And finding me asleepe scorn'd to uncharme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My dull and cursed silence. This distracts me:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have I so long, with so much Art and study,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Labour'd this honour, and obtaind what my</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ambition look'd at, her consent; and when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The tree it selfe bowed downe its golden fruit</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And tempted me to gather, must I make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My selfe uncapable and be guilty of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So black, so base a forfeit? I could teare</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My eyelids of, that durst let in a Mist</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So darke and so destroying, must I sleepe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

At such a tyme that the Divell must be over</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Watche too! This houre hath blasted such a hope</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

As the Earth never teemd with nor the spring</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gave up in smileing blosomes to the breath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of those sweet windes that whisper from the West</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A tale of triumph to the yeere. I could</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dissolve with curseing of my Lathargie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

How shall I looke upon her face whose love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bold adventure I have thus rewarded?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But passion cannot cure my wound; which must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bleed till I see her, and then either cease,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Blest by her pardon, or dismiss a life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

(Though iust) too poore a Sacrifice for her anger.</p>

Where shall I hide my selfe and shame for ever!</p>

<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. You must sitt downe and heare me then while I
At a distance thus deliver—</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Tis more state.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I am most unfortunate.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. In what, deare Damsell?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. And much wrongd by a gentleman I lov'd.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Can he be a gentleman that dares
Wrong so much love and beauty? what's the offence?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. He wo'not love agen.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. And you would have
The stubborne man corrected?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I would be
Revengd if I knew how, and honour him
Should do me Justice.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Name the man; Ile doot.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I cannot.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. How?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Yet turne your face: alas, it is yourselfe.
I have your word to punish him.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Sweet Ladie,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I am well acquainted with the worthy gentleman,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But will not kill nor strike him, for I know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He has just reason not to love you—you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Of all your sex; he told me so.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. His reason?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Was in these wordes; suppose you hear him speak it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Now do you sit—Lady, when I consider you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The perfect frame of what we can call hansome,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With all your attributes of soule and body,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Where no addition or detraction can</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

By <emphasis>Cupids</emphasis> nicer Crittick find a fault,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or <emphasis>Mercury</emphasis> with your eternall flame;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And then consider what a thing I am</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To this high Character of you, so low,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So lost to noble merits, I despaire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To love a Mistresse cannot love agen.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. This is a much dissembled Modesty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Therefore give me the kinder Chambermaid,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That will returne me love for my two peeces</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And give me back twelve pennyworth agen,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Which is as much as I can well receave;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

So there is thirty and nyne shillings cleere</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gotten in Love, and much good do her too't;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I thinke it very well bestow'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. But if I thinke you worthy, and accept
Your service, it destroies this other reason
For your despaire. Why, I can praise you, too.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. No, lett it alone I have other reasons Lady</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Among my papers. But to love or to be in love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Is to be guld; that's the plaine <emphasis>English</emphasis> of <emphasis>Cupids Latine</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Beside, all reverence to the calling, I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have vowd never to marry, and you know</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Love may bring a Man toot at last, and therefore</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My fine Gewgaw do not abuse me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. How can I
When you will neither Love nor marry me?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I was not made for a husband.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. But I would make you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I know what you would make me.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Servant</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ser</emphasis>. Mounsier <emphasis>Device</emphasis>, if you be alone, would present his service.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Is he come?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Sir, do me but one favour, ile recant</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My Love, I wonot have so much as one</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Good thought on you; I will neglect you, sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Nay and abuse you, too, if you obscure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But for three minutes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Ile have patience so long.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Admitt him.—I wilbe reveng'd o' somebody.—
Now, Sir.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Device</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I ha brought you a weapon, Lady.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Mee, what to do, Sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Tis Justice I present it to your feete
Whose love arm[e]d me to vindicate your honour.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. My honour?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. This is but the first of my valour in your cause;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

If you affect these Monuments ile make</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You up an Armorie; meane tyme receave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My Service with this sword: if he provoke me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To fight with him agen, Ile cut his hand of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And bring that wo' me to present the next.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Whose hand, deare servant?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. He is not worth the nameing; las, this does not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Deserve your knowledge. Only thinke what I</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dare do when your bright name is question[e]d,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And I in tyme may merit to be cald</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The darling of your virgin thoughts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I pray stay.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My name traduc'd? who was so impudent?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Do me the grace to let me know on whome</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Your valour had been exercis'd.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Why, the formall thing <emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis>; I would [not] call him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Gentleman; but that I ha baffled him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You need no other witnes but his sword</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

With that fine holliday hilt, Ladie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                       [<emphasis>She shutts the Doore</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Looke you, sir, I ha made fast the Doore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Because I meane before you goe to have</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A satisfaction for the base injury</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You ha done me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I done you injurie!</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Not that I value <emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis>, whome you would</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Pretend has been to saucy with my honour;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But, cause I scorne to owne a goodnes should</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Depend upon your sword or vindication,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Ile fight with you my selfe in this small vollume</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Against your bulke in folio.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Excellent wench!</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. I was your Champion, lady.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Ide rather have no fame then heare thee name it.</p>

Thou fight for a Ladies honour and disarme</p>
<empty-line/>

And make roome for the porters, when like Elephants</p>
<empty-line/>

They carry once a yeare the Citty Castles,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Or goe a feasting with the Drum and foot boyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

To the <emphasis>Bankeside</emphasis> and save the Beares a whipping</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

That day thou art cudgeld for thy saucy challenging</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A sergeant with one eye, that was to much too.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Come, Sir, I meane to have a bout with you.</p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/>
</section>
<section>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. At that weapon?</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. This, and no other.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Ile rather bleed to death then lift a sword</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

In my defence, whose inconsiderate brightnes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

May fright the Roses from your cheeke and leave</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

The Lillies to lament the rude divorce.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

But were a Man to dare me, and your enemy,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

My rage more nimble then [the] <emphasis>Median</emphasis> shaft</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Should flie into his bosome, and your eye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Change anger into smiles to see me fight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And cut him into a ragged staffe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Enter Courtwell</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. I can hold no longer. You have gott a stomack, Sir, with running;
ile try how you can eate a sword.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Ha you an ambush, Lady? Ile cry out murder.
Is two to one faire play?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Let me cut one legg of, to marre his running.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Hold, let me speake.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. What canst thou say for thy baseness?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Some men loves wit, and can without dishonour</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Endure a jeast. Why, do you thinke I know not</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

You were here, and but obscur'd to see my humour.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I came to waite upon you with your sword, I.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. How came you by'te? confesse before this Lady.</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Dost thinke her witts so limber to believe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I could compell it from thee. Twas a trick,</p>

<p>

A meere conceipt of mirth; thou sha't ha mine.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Dost thinke I stand upon a sword? Ile gi' thee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

A case of Pistolls when we come to <emphasis>London</emphasis>;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And shoot me when I love thee not. Pox ont,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Thou apprehende'st me well enough.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. But I am not
Satisfied: do you affect this gentlewoman?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. Hum.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. You will resolve, sir?</p>
<p><emphasis>De</emphasis>. As may become a stranger; ile not loose
Thy friendship for all woman kind.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. He dares not owne you.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. I easilie forgive him; I should hate
My selfe, if I depended on his pitty.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Th'art a noble wench. Shall we leave of
These jigs and speake our harts in earnest? By
These twin lips I love thee extreamely.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Sweare by your owne.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. They shall bee mine. Mounsier,
For your penance you shall along and witnes.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. What, I pray?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. The Priest shall tell you; come, we have both dissembled,
We do love one another.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Tis not possible.</p>
<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Unless you will denie me i'the church.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

I ha vou'd to lie with you to night: <emphasis>Device</emphasis>,</p>

<p>

Amble before and find the parson out;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

We will bee friends and thou shalt be her father.</p>

<p><emphasis>Cou</emphasis>. Come, weele have no more acquainted.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sis</emphasis>. Very pretty.
—I may deceave you yet for all your confidence.</p>

And not deserve to live for't; yet if you
But knew my sufferings—</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Let her be Judge.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. By no meanes, Madam.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. You may trust her knowledge.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. This is worse then a whipping now; these Ladies</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Have no mercy on a delinquent. I must stand toot.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

There is no tyrant to a chamberwoman</p>
<empty-line/>

Made judg in such a cause; Ide give a Limbe</p>

<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. He lookes with some compunction for his fault.
Troth, Madam, choose an other night and trye
Whether he will sleepe agen.</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. Mercifull wench!
If we peece agen it shall be a good turne in thy way.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. My husband is this day resolv'd for <emphasis>London</emphasis>;
It is his humour, or els, worse, suspition.
Ther's no pretence for him to stay behind.</p>
<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>. You have made ill use of your time, Sir <emphasis>Francis</emphasis>;
I know not how to helpe you. Seaven yeare hence
You may have such an other oportunitie.</p>
<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Watch if my husband come not this way, <emphasis>Dorothy</emphasis>.
—Well, sir, though your transgresse deserve no pardon,
Yet I am charitable upon Condition—</p>
<p><emphasis>Fra</emphasis>. Anything, Madam. This shewes exlent in you;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

No pennance shall displease so you absolve me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Bid me to clime some Rock or Pyramide,</p>

Upon whose narrow spire you have advanc'd</p>

Lost to the world in my attempt.</p>

Gloriously; the condition that assures</p>

<p>

Your pardon then for ever to be thus forfeited;</p>
<empty-line/>

Bind me never to see you (and yet that</p>

Were cruelty) then charme me to forgett</p>

That I am man or have a hart, and you</p>
<empty-line/>

A beauty, which your absence can as well</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Make nothing as devide from my adoring.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is not cure but killing to prescribe</p>
<empty-line/>

I never must enjoy you. If you have</p>

Resolv'd a Death upon me, let it bee</p>

When we like Lovers have embrac'd—</p>

Ile tell you, Madam—(sure the Divell has</p>

An exelent rare devise, if you but favour it.</p>

Your husband is imediately for <emphasis>London</emphasis>,</p>

I must in modesty ride with him; you</p>

<p><emphasis>Do</emphasis>.—What a deale of submission these foolish men
Trouble us women with, that are more forward
To be friends agen then they are!</p>

All wanton hope hereafter. Deerest Madam,</p>

If you did meane before this honour to me,</p>

were his family antient gentlemen before the Conquest; some say ever
since the flood.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. <emphasis>Littleland</emphasis>!</p>
<p><emphasis>Foo</emphasis>. But he has now more land then three of the best in the shire,
thanke the <emphasis>Duchmen</emphasis> that have drunk up all the water.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. They water drinkers?</p>
<p><emphasis>Foo</emphasis>. Why not, as well as eate dry land? they are lin'd with butter,
Sir, and feare no Dropsie.</p>
<p><emphasis>Sir Richard reades</emphasis>.</p>
<p><emphasis>She has been absent theis two yeares; the occasion, her dislike and
disaffection to a gentleman whome I confesse I did too seveerely urge

her condition, I hope upon this knowledge you will with consideration of
her quality (she being the onely Child and heire to my fortune) use her
like a gentlewoman. And though my yeares have made me unfitt for
travell, I do intend, upon returne of your Letters, personally to give
you thankes for your respects to my Daughter, whome I shall receave as
new blessing from you, and be happie upon any turne presented to

Dangerously; he has purg'd his stomack, but the ill spiritts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Are flowne into his head and spoild his eares.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

He was ever troubled with Devices in his head;</p>
<empty-line/>

I stronglie feare he must have his scull open'd,</p>

Or opening of a stomack that has crudities;</p>

With the very wind and flourish of his instrument
He will strike flatt a projector at twelve score.</p>
<p><emphasis>Ri</emphasis>. Does he not heare you?</p>
<p><emphasis>Cap</emphasis>. He has lost that sence he saies, unless he counterfeits;

A little too much witt to bee a wife;</p>

I thinke my horse saw the Divell in some hedge:</p>

Ere I had rid three furlongs, gave a start,</p>

Pitcht me of ons back like a barr and broke</p>
<empty-line/>

A flint with my shoulder, I thinke, which strooke fire too;</p>

There was something like it in my eyes, Ime punish'd.</p>

Enjoy you, Madam, I shall breake my neck;</p>

That will be next. Ile take this for a warning</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

And will leave of in tyme.</p>

Deare Madame, be you treasurer. I confesse
I have wealth enough in such a noble husband.</p>

And use him well.</p>

<p><emphasis>La</emphasis>. Where is the footman you talke of?</p>
<p><emphasis>Tho</emphasis>. He pretended Letters to carry two mile of to a kinsman of his
Masters, and returne presently. He dranke three or fower beere glasses
of sack, and he ran away so lightlie.</p>

Country</emphasis>[279] Leaguer. Or thou, <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis>? ile give thee a Coppiehold.</p>

<p><strong>FINIS.</strong></p>
<empty-line/><empty-line/><empty-line/>
<p><strong>APPENDIX I.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The folio volume numbered Eg. MS. 1,994 contains 349 leaves. It was
purchased by the British Museum, for the very modest sum of thirty-three
pounds, at the sale of Lord Charlemont's library on August 6, 1865. Mr.
Warner (of the Manuscript Department of the British Museum), to whom the
public are indebted for an excellent catalogue of the Dulwich
Collection, thinks that the volume originally belonged to Dulwich
College. Towards the end of the XVIIth century Cartwright, the actor,
bequeathed to the College a number of MS. plays, which the College
authorities in the middle of the last century exchanged (horrendum
dictu!) for tomes of controversial divinity. Of all the plays left by
the actor only one[280]—and that imperfect—remains. The late Lord
Charlemont was a friend of Malone, and it is well known that Malone had
many of the Dulwich documents in his possession for years. Mr. Warner's
theory is that Malone lent the volume to Lord Charlemont, and that it
was never returned. The objection that naturally suggests itself is,
"How came so acute a scholar as Malone to fail to draw attention to a
Collection of such considerable interest?" And I confess that I am not
able to offer any satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>The volume contains in all fifteen plays, written in various hands. One
piece has the author's initials attached, but the others have neither
name nor initials.</p>
<p>First in order, leaves 1-29, stands Fletcher's <emphasis>Elder Brother</emphasis>. I have
compared the MS. with Dyce's text, and find the variations to be few and
unimportant. In III. 3 Dyce follows the old copies in reading:—</p>
<p>    What a noise is in this house! my head is broken</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Within a parenthesis: in every corner,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As if the earth were shaken with some strange colic,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    There are stirs and motions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>As the words "within a parenthesis" were found in all the old copies
Dyce did not feel justified in rejecting them, although he had only the
most grotesque meaning to assign to them. Theobald rightly saw that
"within a parenthesis" was a marginal note, mistaken for a part of the
text when the book was sent to press. The MS. gives—</p>
<p>    Sweet heart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What noyse is in this house? my head is broken</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In every corner, as the earth were shaken</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With some strange Collick: there are stirs and motions:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What planet rules this house? Whos there?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In III. 5 the MS. supports Mason's correction "Their blue veins <emphasis>and</emphasis>
blush disclose," where Dyce followed the old reading "<emphasis>in</emphasis> blush."—At
the end of the play, after the Epilogue, are written the three following
Epigrams:—</p>
<p>    A freemans life is like a pilgrimage:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What's his life then that lives in mariage?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Tis <emphasis>Sisyphus</emphasis> his toyle that with a stone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Doth doe what surely for ease must be done.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His labours journey's endles; 'tis no riddle,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Since he's but halfe on's way that stands inth' middle.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>                <emphasis>Ad Janum</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    Take comfort, <emphasis>Janus</emphasis>; never feare thy head</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which to the quick belongs, not to the dead.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy wife did lye with one; thou, being dead drunke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then art no Cuckold though she bee a Punke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Tis not the state nor soveraintie of <emphasis>Jove</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Could draw thy pure affections from my love:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Nor is there any <emphasis>Venus</emphasis> in the skyes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Could from thy lookes withdraw my greedy eyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leaves 30-51 are taken up with <emphasis>Dick of Devonshire</emphasis>. Then follows an
unnamed play (leaves 52-73), written in a villainous hand. If I succeed
in transcribing this play I shall print it in the third volume, for it
seems to be an unpublished play of Heywood's. The next piece, entitled
<emphasis>Calisto</emphasis> (leaves 74-95), which is written in the same hand, consists of
scenes from Heywood's <emphasis>Golden Age</emphasis> and <emphasis>Silver Age</emphasis>. There are many
variations from the printed copies, showing that the most active of the
old playwrights found time to revise his works. Here is a song that was
omitted in the printed copy. Its proper place in Pearson's <emphasis>Reprint</emphasis> of
Heywood is vol. iii. p. 67:—</p>
<p>    Whether they be awake or sleepe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    With what greate Care ought Virgins keepe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          With what art and indevor,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The Jewell which they ought to pryse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Above the ritchest marchandise,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And once lost lost for ever!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Virginity is a rare gem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Rated above a diadem,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And was despised never:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    'Tis that at which the most men ayme</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And being gott they count their game</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          And once lost lost for ever.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Of the charming song "Haile beauteous <emphasis>Dian</emphasis>, Queene of Shades" the MS.
gives a far inferior version:—</p>
<p>    Thou <emphasis>Trivia</emphasis>, dost alone excell,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In heaven when thou dost please to dwell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Cald <emphasis>Cynthia, Proserpine</emphasis> in Hell:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

          But when thou theair art fyred</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And takest thy bugle and thy bowe,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To chase on Earth the hart or doe,</p>

<p>We come now to a chronicle play (leaves 97-118), <emphasis>Edmond Ironside: The
English King</emphasis>. This piece had a second title—<emphasis>A trew Chronicle History
called War hath made all friends</emphasis>. It must be confessed that this old
play is a tedious business, sadly wanting in life and movement. The
following extract will give a taste of the author's quality:—</p>
<p>        <emphasis>Enter Canutus, Edricus with other Lords and souldiers</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Canutus</emphasis>. A plague upon you all for arrant cowards!</p>
<empty-line/>

    Brislinge his feathers, settinge upp his plumes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Clappinge his winges and crowinge lowder out</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Then doth a cocke of game that meanes to fight;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Yett after, when he feeles the spurres to pricke,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Crakes like a Craven and bewrayes himself:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Even soe my bigbond <emphasis>Daines</emphasis>, adrest to fight</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As though they meant to scale the Cope of heaven,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (And like the Giants graple with the gods)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    At first encounter rush uppon theire foes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But straight retire: retire? nay, run awaye</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As men distraught with lightninge from above</p>
<empty-line/>

    Or dastards feared with a sodaine fraye.</p>

    And change the Countenaunce of her cloudy browe,</p>
<empty-line/>

    Now you must hope for better still and better</p>
<empty-line/>

    And <emphasis>Edmond</emphasis> must expect still worse and worse,</p>

    Thy tongue rowles headlong into flattery.</p>

    <emphasis>Edmond</emphasis> is blest: oh, had I but his men,</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>The next piece (leaves 119-135), which is without a title, is founded on
the Charlemagne romances. My friend, Mr. S.L. Lee, editor of <emphasis>Huon of
Bordeaux</emphasis>, in answer to my inquiries writes as follows: "Almost all the
characters in this play are the traditional heroes of the French
Charlemagne romances, and stand in the same relation to one another as
in the <emphasis>Lyf of Charles the Grete</emphasis> and the <emphasis>Four Sons of Aymon</emphasis>, both of
which were first printed by Caxton, and secured through later editions a
wide popularity in England during the XVIth century. I believe, however,
that the story of the magic ring is drawn from another source. It is
unknown to the Charlemagne romances of France and England, but it
appears in several German legends of the Emperor, and is said to be
still a living tradition at Aix-la-Chapelle, where the episode is
usually localised (cf. Gaston, Paris, <emphasis>Histoire Poétique de
Charlemagne</emphasis>, p. 383). Petrarch has given a succinct account of it in a
letter written from Cologne, in which he states that he learnt it from
the priests of the city, and it is through his narrative that the legend
appears to have reached England. John Skelton in his poem 'Why come ye
not to court?' quotes the story, and refers to the Italian poet as his
authority (cf. Dyce's Skelton, II. 48 and 364, where the letter is
printed at length). Southey has also made the tradition the subject of a
ballad entitled <emphasis>King Charlemain</emphasis> to which he has prefixed a French
translation of the passage of Petrarch. In 1589 George Peele in a
<emphasis>Farewell</emphasis> addressed to Morris and Drake on setting out with the English
forces for Spain tells them to</p>
<p>    Bid theatres and proud tragedians,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Bid Mahomet, Scipio, &amp; mighty Tamburlaine,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    King <emphasis>Charlemagne</emphasis>, Tom Stukeley and the rest</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Adieu.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Dyce, in a note on this passage (Dyce's Peele, II. 88) writes: 'No drama
called <emphasis>Charlemagne</emphasis> has come down to us, nor am I acquainted with any
old play in which that monarch figures.' But we know from Henslowe's
diary that in at least two plays that were dramatised from Charlemagne
romances the Emperor must have taken a part." Mr. Lee concludes his most
interesting note by suggesting that the present play may be the one to
which Peele alludes; but he will at once perceive from my extracts that
the date 1589 is much too early. Here is a passage that might have been
written by Cyril Tourneur:—</p>
<p>        [<emphasis>Ganelon</emphasis> stabs <emphasis>Richard</emphasis>, his dearest friend,
        suspecting him of treachery.]</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Rich</emphasis>. O you've slayne me! tell me, cruell sir,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Why you have doone thys, that myne innocent soule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    May teache repentance to you—    <emphasis>dies</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Gan</emphasis>. Speake it out,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    What, not a worde? dumbe with a littill blowe?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You are growne statlye, are you? tys even so:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You have the trycke of mightie men in courte</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To speake at leasure and pretend imployment.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Well, take your tyme; tys not materyall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whether you speake the resydue behynde</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now or at doomes day. If thy common sence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Be not yet parted from thee, understand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I doe not misse thee dyinge because once</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I loved thee dearlye; and collect by that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    There is no Devyll in me nor in hell</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That could have flesht me to this violent deathe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hadst thou beene false to all the world but me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The concentrated bitterness of those lines is surpassed by nothing in
the <emphasis>Revenger's Tragedy</emphasis>. Indeed, I am inclined to believe that the
whole play, which is very unskilfully constructed, is by Tourneur, or
perhaps by the author[281] of the <emphasis>Second Maiden's Tragedy</emphasis>. All the
figures are shrouded in a blank starless gloom; to read the play is to
watch the riot of devils. Here is an extract from the scene where
<emphasis>Orlando</emphasis>, returning from the wars, hears that <emphasis>Charlemagne</emphasis>, his uncle,
has married <emphasis>Ganelon's</emphasis> niece, and that his own hopes of succession have
been ruined by the birth of a son:—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Orl[ando.]</emphasis> I am the verye foote-ball of the starres,</p>

    But, for her standing on a roullinge stone,</p>

    Theare learninge faylls theym, for she fixed stands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And onlye against me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I may perhaps be tempted to print this play in full. The MS. has
suffered somewhat, many lines having been cut away at the foot of some
of the pages. Although the first scene is marked <emphasis>Act 2, Scene 2</emphasis>,[282]
the play seemed to me to be complete. On the last leaf is written "Nella
[Greek: phdphnr] la B." Some name is possibly concealed under these
enigmatic letters; but the riddle would defy an Oedipus.</p>
<p>The next play (leaves 136-160) is entitled <emphasis>The fatal Maryage, or a
second Lucreatya</emphasis>. <emphasis>Galeas</emphasis>, on returning from the wars, crowned with
praises, is requested by his widowed mother to make a journey into the
province of <emphasis>Parma</emphasis> to receive moneys owed by Signor <emphasis>Jouanny</emphasis>. On his
arrival he falls in love with <emphasis>Jouanny's</emphasis> daughter, <emphasis>Lucretia</emphasis>, runs
away with her, and secretly marries her. <emphasis>Galeas'</emphasis> mother, angered at
the match, practises to convey <emphasis>Lucretia</emphasis> to a nunnery and get her son
married to an earl's daughter; but <emphasis>Galeas</emphasis> defeats his mother's
machinations by killing himself and <emphasis>Lucretia</emphasis>. There is a second plot
to this odd play, but enough has been said. The meeting between <emphasis>Galeas</emphasis>
and <emphasis>Jouanny</emphasis> is the best thing in the play:—</p>
<p>        <emphasis>Enter Galeas &amp; Jacomo</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. You spake with him as I comanded you?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jac</emphasis>. And had his promise to meet you presently.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. I have heard much fame of him since my arrive,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His generall nature, hospitable love;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    His [He's?] good to all men, enemy to none.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Indeed he has that perfect character</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Before I see him I'm in love with him.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Jac</emphasis>. Hee has the fame few Cittizens deserve.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. Why, sir, few Cittizens?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jac</emphasis>. His words his bond, and does not break that bond
    To bankrupt others; he makes you not a library
    Of large monopolie to cosen all men:
    <emphasis>Subintelligitur</emphasis>, he hates to deale
    With such portentious othes as furr his mouth
    In the deliverance.</p>
<p>        <emphasis>Enter Jouanny</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. Hee comes himselfe.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. Sir <emphasis>Galeas</emphasis>, if I mistake not?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. I weare my fathers name, sir.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. And tis a dignity to weare that name.
    Whatts your affairs in <emphasis>Parma</emphasis>?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. To visit you, sir.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. Gladness nor sorrow never paid mans debts.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    —Your pleasure, sir?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. The livery of my griefe: my fathers dead</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And mee hath made his poore executor.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. What? ought hee ten thousand duckets?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy fathers face fixt in thy front</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Should be the paymaster tho from my hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. I doe not come to borrow: please yee read.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. Read? and with good regard, for sorrow paies noe debts.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. The summes soe great I feare, once read by him,
    My seeming frend will prove my enemy.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jac</emphasis>. Faith, if he doe, hee proves like your French
    galloshes that promise faire to the feet, yet twice a day
    leave a man in the durt.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. Was this your fathers pleasure?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. It was his hand.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. It was his writing, I know it as my owne,
    Wherein hee has wronged mee beyond measure?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. How? my father wrongd yee? I'm his sonn.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. Wert thou his father I'm wrongd,—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Iniurd, calumniated, baffled to my teeth;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And were it not that these gray haires of mine</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Were priviledgd ane enemy to vallour,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have a heart could see your fathers wrong—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. What? raile you, sir?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jac</emphasis>. Challenge a half pint pot.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. There in a sawpitt, knave, to quitt my self
    Of such an inury.—Hee writes mee here
    That I should pay to you tenn thousand crownes.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. As being due to him.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. But thatts not my quarrell, sir; for I did owe to him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Millions of Crownes, millions of my love;—</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And but to send a note here for his owne!</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ist not a quarrell for an honest man?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Jac</emphasis>. With very few, I thinke.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. Why, looke yee, sir:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When after many a storme and dreadfull blow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Strooke from fire-belching clouds, bankrupt of life</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have home return'd; when all my frends denide</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Their thresholds to mee, and my creditors</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Desir'd to sinke mee in a prisoners grave,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hee gave mee dying life, his helpefull hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sent mee to sea and kept mee safe on land.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ist not a quarrell then to seeke butts owne?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. Oh, pray, sir—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. When all the talents of oppression</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of usurers, lawyers and my creditors</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Had fangd upon my wife and family,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hee gave mee dying life, his helpfull hand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sent mee to sea and kept mee safe on land.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ist not a quarrell then to seeke but's owne?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. Good sir—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Jou</emphasis>. Come in, sir, where I will pay all that you can demand:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Noe other quarrell, sir, shall passe your hand.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Ga</emphasis>. If every [one] should pay as well as you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The world were good, wee should have bankrupts few.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Jac</emphasis>. I'm of your mind for that.    [<emphasis>Exeunt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>We now come to a play (leaves 161-185), without title, and wanting some
leaves at the end, on the subject of Richard the Second. I think with
Mr. Halliwell-Phillipps, who printed eleven copies of this piece, that
it is anterior to Shakespeare's play. There is less extravagance of
language than in most of the plays belonging to that early date (circ.
1593?); and the blank verse, though it is monotonous enough, has perhaps
rather more variety than we should expect to find. Much of the play is
taken up with <emphasis>Greene</emphasis> and <emphasis>Baggott</emphasis>; but the playwright has chiefly
exerted himself in representing the murder of <emphasis>Woodstock</emphasis> at Calais.
Before the murder, <emphasis>Woodstock</emphasis> falls asleep, and there appears to him
the ghost of the <emphasis>Black Prince</emphasis>:</p>
<p>                     … Oh I am nought but ayre:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Had I the vigour of my former strength</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    When thou beheldst me fight at <emphasis>Cressy</emphasis> feild,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Wher hand to hand I tooke King <emphasis>John</emphasis> of <emphasis>France</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And his bould sonns my captive prisoners,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ide shake these stiff supporters of thy bed</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And dragg thee from this dull securyty.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Oh yett for pittye wake; prevent thy doome;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy blood upon my sonne will surely come:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For which, deere brother <emphasis>Woodstocke</emphasis>, haste and fly,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Prevent his ruein and thy tragedy.    [<emphasis>Exit Ghoste</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Undisturbed by this appeal, <emphasis>Woodstock</emphasis> slumbers on. Then enters the
ghost of <emphasis>Edward the Third</emphasis>. His speech is worthy of Robert Greene:—</p>
<p>    Sleepst thou so soundly and pale death so nye?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>Thomas</emphasis> of <emphasis>Woodstocke</emphasis>, wake my sone and fly.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Thy wrongs have roused thy royall fathers ghost,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And from his quiat grave king <emphasis>Edwards</emphasis> come</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To guard thy innocent life, my princely sonne.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Behould me heere, sometymes faire <emphasis>Englands</emphasis> lord:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (7) warlicke sonnes I left, yett being gone</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    No one succeeded in my kingly throne, &amp;c.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>I will not inflict more of this stuff on the reader. Suffice it to say
that <emphasis>Woodstock</emphasis> wakes in terror and calls aloud. <emphasis>Lapoole</emphasis>, the
governor of the city, who is close at hand with two murderers, enters
and comforts him. Here the playwright shows a touch of pathos:—</p>
<p>    Good nyght, <emphasis>Lapoole</emphasis>, and pardon me, I prethee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That my sadd feare made question of thy faith.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My state is fearefull and my mynd was troubled</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Even at thy entrance with most fearefull vissions</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which made my passiones more extreame and hastye.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Out of my better judgment I repent itt</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And will reward thy love: once more, good nyght.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Now follows the <emphasis>Lady Mother</emphasis> (leaves 186-211), which I have proved to
be a play of Glapthorne's. No doubt it is the same piece as the <emphasis>Noble
Trial</emphasis>, entered on the Stationers' Registers, June 29, 1660, but not
printed.</p>
<p>Then we have a masque (leaves 212-223). On the first page are given the
<emphasis>nomina actorum</emphasis>, and underneath is written "August 5th, 1643." I was
surprised to find in this masque a long passage that occurs also in
Chapman's <emphasis>Byron's Tragedie</emphasis> (ed. Pearson, ii. 262). Ben Jonson said (to
Drummond of Hawthornden) that only he and Chapman knew how to write a
masque. The remark has always puzzled me, and certainly I should never
have thought of Chapman's name in connexion with this masque. Here is an
extract, containing the passage from <emphasis>Byron's Tragedie</emphasis>:—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Love</emphasis>. For thy sake, Will, I feathered all my thoughts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And in a bird's shape flew in to her bosome,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The bosome of <emphasis>Desert</emphasis>, thy beautious Mistris,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As if I had been driven by the hauke</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In that sweet sanctuary to save my liffe.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    She smild on me, cald me her prety bird,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And for her sport she tyed my little legs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In her faire haire. Proud of my golden fetters</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I chirped for Joy; she confident of my lameness,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Soon disintangled me &amp; then she percht me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Upon her naked breast. There being ravishd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I sung with all my cheere and best of skill.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    She answered note for note, relish for relish,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And ran division with such art and ease</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That she exceeded me.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Judgment</emphasis>. There was rare musicke.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Love</emphasis>. In this swete strife, forgetting where I stood.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I trod so hard in straining of my voice</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That with my claw I rent her tender skin;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which as she felt and saw vermillion follow</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Stayning the cullor of <emphasis>Adonis</emphasis> bleeding</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In <emphasis>Venus</emphasis> lap, with indignation</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    She cast me from her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Will</emphasis>. That fortune be to all that injure her.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Love</emphasis>. Then I put on this shepheards shape you see;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I tooke my bow and quiver as in revenge</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Against the birds, shooting and following them</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    From tre to tre. She passing by beheld</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And liked the sport. I offerrd her my prey,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which she receved and asked to feele my bowe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which when she handled and beheld the beauty</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of my bright arrowes, she began to beg em.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I answered they were all my riches, yet</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I was content to hazard all and stake em</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Downe to a kiss at a game at chess with her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    "Wanton," quoth she, being privy to her skill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    "A match!" Then she with that dexterrytey</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Answered my challenge that I lost my weapons:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Now <emphasis>Cupides</emphasis> shaffts are headed with her lookes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My mother soone perceiving my disgrace,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My Arms beinge lost and gon which made me a terror</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To all the world, she tooke away my wings,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Renouncd me for her child and cast me from her;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And more, to be revengd upon <emphasis>Desert</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Comanded <emphasis>Danger</emphasis> to be her strong keeper,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That should she empt my quiver at the hearts</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of men they might not dare to court her, fearing</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That horrid mischiefe that attends [on] her.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On this I threw me headlong on the sea</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To sleepe my tyme out in the bottome off it;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Whence you have puld me up to be a scorne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To all the World.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Will</emphasis>. Not so, my prety boy, Ill arme the againe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    My breast shall be thy quiver, my sighes thy shaffts:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And heres an opportunytey to be wingd againe;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Se here the wings of <emphasis>Fortune</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Love</emphasis>. <emphasis>Fortunes</emphasis> wings</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Are full of giddy feathers to unsure</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For me to fly with all, but I will stay with you,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I like so well this aire; onely you must</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Provide to keepe me from the hands of <emphasis>Danger</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That wayts upon <emphasis>Dessert</emphasis>.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Will</emphasis>. Our selfes and all</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>Arcadia</emphasis> shall be your guard and wher</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    <emphasis>Love</emphasis> passes and recides he shall be allwayes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Armd and attended by a band of lovers,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Such faithfull ones as if that ugly <emphasis>Danger</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Were <emphasis>Lucifer</emphasis> himselfe, they should defend you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Next on our List (leaves 224-244) is the <emphasis>Two Noble Ladyes, or the
Converted Conjurer</emphasis>. This "Tragicomicall Historie often tymes acted with
approbation at the <emphasis>Red Bull</emphasis> in St. <emphasis>John's</emphasis> Streete by the company of
the Revells," is a coarse noisy play. The comic part consists of the
most absurd buffoonery, and the rest is very stilted. But there is one
scene—and one only—which shows genuine poetic power. It is where
<emphasis>Cyprian</emphasis>, the sorcerer, having by his magical arts saved <emphasis>Justina</emphasis>, a
Christian maiden, tries to gain her love:—</p>
<p>        <emphasis>Enter Cyprian and Justina</emphasis>.</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Cyprian</emphasis>. Doe not disdayne, faire peece of Natures pride,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To heare him plead for love that sav'd thy life.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    It was my pow'rfull arte produc'd those monsters</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To drowne those monstrous executioners</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That should have wrought your wracke.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Justina</emphasis>. Sir, I am sorry</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hell had a hand in my delivery:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That action cannot merrit my affection.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Cyprian</emphasis>. I not alleadge it for desert of grace</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But argument of mercie: pitty him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That in distresse so lately pitty'd you.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Justina</emphasis>. I am the troth-plight wife of <emphasis>Clitophon</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The Prince of <emphasis>Babylon</emphasis>; hee has my hart,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And theres no share for others.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Cyprian</emphasis>. That high state</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Is now at a low ebbe: destruction</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Hangs like a threatning Commet ore the walls</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of <emphasis>Babilon</emphasis>. Then fix thy love on him</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That can more then the greatest prince on earth.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Love mee, and princes shall thy pages bee;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Monarchs shall lay their crownes and royalties</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As presents at thy feet; the <emphasis>Indian</emphasis> mynes</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shall be thy ioyntures; all the worldes rich marchants</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Shall bring their pearles and pretious stones to thee,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Sweet gums and spices of <emphasis>Arabia</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fine <emphasis>Median</emphasis> linnen and Barbarian silkes;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The earth shall beare no fruit of raritie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    But thou shalt taste it. Weele transforme ourselves</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In quaintest shapes to vary our delights.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And in a chariot wrought out of a cloud,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Studded with starres, drawne through the subtle aire</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By birds of paradise, wee'll ride together</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To fruitfull <emphasis>Thessalie</emphasis>, where in fair <emphasis>Tempe</emphasis></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (The only pleasant place of all the earth)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Wee'll sport us under a pavilion</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Of <emphasis>Tyrian</emphasis> scarlet.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Justina</emphasis>. Should these rarities</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    (Faithlesse as are your wondrous promises)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Lead me into the hazard of my soule</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And losse of such ay-lasting happinesse</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    As all earths glories are but shaddows to?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Cyprian</emphasis>. Thincke you this rare pile of perfection.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Wherein Love reads a lecture of delight,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Ows not it's use to Nature? There is love</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In every thing that lives: the very sunne</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Does burne in love while we partake his heate;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The clyming ivy with her loving twines</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Clips the strong oake. No skill of surgerie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Can heale the wounds, nor oceans quench the flames</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Made by all pow'rfull love. Witnesse myselfe:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Since first the booke of your perfections</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Was brought so neare than I might read it ore,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I have read in it charmes to countermand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    All my enchantments and enforce mee stoop</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To begge your love.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Justina</emphasis>. How ere you please to style</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A lustfull appetite, it takes not mee.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Heav'n has my bow my life shall never bee</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Elder then my unstain'd virginitie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Cyprian</emphasis>. Virginitie! prize you so dearely that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which common things cast of? Marke but the flow'rs</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That now as morning fresh, fragrant and faire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Lay ope their beautys to the courting sunne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And amongst all the modest mayden rose:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    These wanton with the aire until unleavd</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    They die and so loose their virginitie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    <emphasis>Justina</emphasis>. In <emphasis>India</emphasis> there is a flow'r (they say)</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Which, if a man come neare it, turnes away:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    By that I learne this lesson, to descrie</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Corrupt temptations and the tempter flie.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Leaves 245-267 are taken up with the <emphasis>Tragedy of Nero</emphasis>, which was
printed in 1624. Then comes [Daborne's] <emphasis>Poore Man's Comfort</emphasis>
(268-292), an inferior play printed in 1655. Afterwards follows a dull
play (leaves 293-316), <emphasis>Loves Changlelings Changed</emphasis>, founded on Sidney's
<emphasis>Arcadia</emphasis>. The last piece in the book (leaves 317-349) is <emphasis>The
lancheinge of the May</emphasis>, Written by W.M. Gent in his return from <emphasis>East
India</emphasis>, A.D. 1632. There is a second title, <emphasis>The Seamans honest wife</emphasis>,
to this extraordinary piece. On the last leaf is a note by Sir Henry
Herbert:—"This Play called ye <emphasis>Seamans honest wife</emphasis>, all ye Oaths
left out in ye action as they are crost in ye booke &amp; all other
Reformations strictly observed, may bee acted, not otherwise. This 27th
June, 1633.      HENRY HERBERT.</p>

<p>"I command your Bookeeper to present mee with a faire Copy hereaft[er]
and to leave out all oathes, prophaness &amp; publick Ribaldry as he will
answer it at his perill.      H. HERBERT."</p>
<p>It is plain therefore that the piece was intended for presentation on
the stage; but it must have been a strange audience that could have
listened to it. Dramatic interest there is none whatever. The piece is
nothing more, than a laudation of the East India Company. In tables of
statistics we have set before us the amount of merchandise brought from
the East; and the writer dwells with enthusiasm on the liberality of the
Company, and shows how new channels have been opened for industry. One
extract will be enough:—</p>

<p><strong>APPENDIX II.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The following note is by Mr. Robert Boyle, of St. Petersburg, a
Shakespearian scholar, whose name is well known to readers of the
<emphasis>Anglia</emphasis> and the <emphasis>New Shakspere Society's Transactions</emphasis>. Mr. Boyle, who
has a close acquaintance with Massinger, on seeing the proof-sheets of
<emphasis>Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt</emphasis>, pointed out several repetitions of
expressions used in other plays of Massinger. It will be understood that
I do not adopt Mr. Boyle's conclusions unreservedly. Possibly in an
Appendix to Vol. IV. I may return to a consideration of <emphasis>Barnavelt</emphasis>, but
the present volume has already swollen beyond its limits.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><emphasis>Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt</emphasis>.</p>
<p>This play, the most valuable Christmas present English scholars have for
half a century received, appears indubitably to belong to the Massinger
and Fletcher series. Even a cursory glance will convince the reader that
it is one of the greatest treasures of our dramatic literature. That
such a gem should lie in manuscript for over 200 years, should be
catalogued in our first library, should be accessible to the eye of the
prying scholar, and yet never even be noticed till now, affords a
disagreeable but convincing proof of the want of interest in our early
literature displayed even by those whose studies in this field would
seem to point them out for the work of rescuing these literary treasures
from a fate as bad as that which befell those plays which perished at
the hands of Warburton's "accursed menial." The present play has some
remarkable features in it. It is taken from contemporary history (the
only one as far as we know of that class in which Massinger was
engaged). It was written almost immediately after the events it
describes. These events took place in the country in which Englishmen
then took more interest than in any other country in Europe. There is a
tone of political passion in the play which, particularly in one place,
breaks out in an expression which the hearers must have applied to their
own country. There is no doubt that the audience wandered away in their
thoughts from Sir John Van Olden Barnavelt, the saviour of his country
from the Spanish yoke, as he professed himself in his defence on his
trial, and Spain's determined enemy, to Sir Walter Raleigh, whose head
had just fallen on the block, the victim of a perfidious foe and of a
mean, shuffling king. The following is the passage:—</p>
<p>    Octavius, when he did affect the Empire,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And strove to tread upon the neck of Rome</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all her ancient freedoms, took that course</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That now is practised on you; for the Catos,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And all free spirits slain or else proscribed,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That durst have stirred against him, he then seized</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The Absolute rule of all. <emphasis>You can apply this</emphasis>.    p. 292.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>In a note Mr. Bullen informs us, that "You can apply this" is crossed
through. He does not state whether there is anything to show that this
was done by Sir George Buck, Master of the Revels, and consequently
Censor for the Stage. But this would appear to be the case, the more so
as the present play seems to have raised scruples in many places in the
mind of the dramatic Cerberus. It is hardly possible to imagine that the
spectators did not apply the "free spirits" to Raleigh, and the "Catos"
to those members who were shortly after to be imprisoned on account of a
memorable protest entered in the journals of the House, which Octavius,
who was trying to seize the absolute rule of all, tore out with his own
royal hands. There is a peculiar fitness in this hit at James as
Octavius which probably did not escape the audience. There is another
passage, on p. 253, which, singular to say, seems to have escaped the
notice of the Censor:—</p>
<p>    Such mild proceedings in a Government</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    New settled, whose main power had its dependence</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Upon the power of some particular men,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Might be given way to, but in ours it were</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Unsafe and scandalous.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Vandort, the speaker here, is opposing the idea of mercy to Barnavelt.
The language is very mild, but receives a peculiar shade of meaning when
read in connexion with the following passage by Massinger from the
<emphasis>Virgin Martyr</emphasis>, I. 1, 236:—</p>
<p>                   In all growing empires</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Even cruelty is useful; some must suffer</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And be set up examples to strike terror</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In others, though far off: but when a state</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Is raised to her perfection, and her bases</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Too firm to shrink, or yield, we may use mercy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And do't with safety.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>The <emphasis>Virgin Martyr</emphasis> is noticed October 6th, 1620, as newly reformed. It
was probably written not long before. The two passages above mentioned
would seem to bring the two plays into connexion. But, it may be asked,
what proof have we that it was a production of Massinger and Fletcher?
As for the latter, there can be no doubt. His double endings are
sufficient proof. As for the Massinger part, there is first the
probability of his being Fletcher's partner, as the play belongs to a
period when we know they were working together; secondly, the metrical
style could belong to nobody else; thirdly, according to his well-known
manner, he has allusions to and repetitions of expressions in his other
plays. As I have gone through Massinger with a view to these
repetitions, I propose to notice those that occur in the present play.
When I allude to a play going under the name of Beaumont and Fletcher as
partly Massinger's, I am supported either by Mr. Fleay's tables,
published in the <emphasis>Transactions of the New Shakspere Society</emphasis>, or to my
own extension of these tables published in the <emphasis>Eng. Studien</emphasis>, a German
periodical for English literature and philology.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Act I. The First Scene is by Massinger, who almost always begins the
joint plays. On page 210 we have—</strong></p>
<p>    When I should pass with glory to my rest.</p>
<p>Compare <emphasis>Virgin Martyr</emphasis>, V. 2. 319.</p>
<p>    When thou shouldst pass with honour to thy rest.</p>
<p>On page 211,</p>
<p>                             And end that race</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You have so long run strongly, like a child,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>is a repetition of the idea in <emphasis>Virgin Martyr</emphasis>. On page 212 "Grave
Maurice"; here "Grave" is Count Maurice, who is also so called in
<emphasis>Love's Cure</emphasis>, I. 2. Bobadilla's speech. (<emphasis>Love's Cure</emphasis> is by Massinger
and another author, not Fletcher.)</p>
<p>Page 213.</p>
<p>                    The desire of glory</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Was the last frailty wise men ere put off.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This occurs again in <emphasis>A Very Woman</emphasis>, V. 4, line 10,—</p>
<p>    Though the desire of fame be the last weakness</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Wise men put off.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Though the thought occurs in Tacitus and Simplicius, Milton seems to
have adopted it, as he has done many other of his most striking
passages from Massinger. It occurs also in at least one other play of
Massinger's, but the passage has escaped me for the moment.</p>
<p>Same page:—</p>
<p>                       'Tis like yourself,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like Barnavelt, and in that all is spoken.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>An expression which, with a slight change from "spoken" to
"comprehended," occurs in almost every one of Massinger's plays.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Act I. Scene 2, is also by Massinger. On page 218,—</strong></p>
<p>    We need not add this wind by our observance</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To sails too full already.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>This reminds us of the common Massinger simile,—</p>
<p>    Too large a sail for your small bark.</p>
<p>And <emphasis>Virg. Mar</emphasis>., I. 1. 85,—</p>
<p>                               You pour oil</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    On fire that burns already at the height.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Both similes occur in almost all Massinger's plays.</p>
<p>The situation on page 219 has a striking resemblance to a similar scene
with Cranmer in <emphasis>Henry VIII</emphasis>. Both Maurice and Cranmer are to be
disgraced by being kept waiting outside while their enemies were at
Council. I cannot help here repeating what I have expressed before, that
<emphasis>Henry VIII</emphasis>. as we have it is not the work of Shakespeare and Fletcher,
but of Massinger and Fletcher, with only fragments of the Shakespeare
play.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Act I. Scene 3, is by Fletcher.</strong></p>
<empty-line/>
<p><strong>Act II. Scene 1, is by Massinger.</strong></p>
<p>On page 231 we have,—</p>
<p>              When the hot lyon's breath</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Burns up the fields.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Compare <emphasis>Parliament of Love</emphasis>, I. 5., Montrose,—</p>
<p>    When the hot lion's breath singeth the fields.</p>
<p>A little lower down, "At all parts" occurs in almost every play of</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Massinger.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>On page 232, "This I foresaw," is also very common in similar
situations. Among numerous cases I refer to the <emphasis>Unnatural Combat</emphasis>, Act
III., about the end, and <emphasis>Maid of Honour</emphasis>, II. iii., where exactly the
same words are used.</p>
<p>Page 233, "Be ne'er remembered," occurs in almost all Massinger's plays.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

It is the most frequent of his many repetitions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>A little lower down. "And something there I'll do," is a well-known</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

Massingerism, occurring everywhere in his plays.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>II. 2, is by Fletcher; 3, and 4, 5, 6, 7 are also probably his.</p>
<p>III. 1, is Fletcher's. On page 250 Barnavelt's hope that the soldiers
will regret him because he fed and nursed them, stands in flagrant
opposition to what Massinger says of Barnavelt's cashiering the Captain,
on page 215.</p>
<p>III. 2, is by Massinger.</p>
<p>Page 252, "But that is not the hazard that I would shun," is one of the
commonest Massingerisms. The passage on page 253 has been mentioned
already. Massinger is almost the only later dramatist who has a large
number of dissyllable "tions." We have here (253),—</p>
<p>    Of what condi_ti-on_ soever, we</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Palliate seditions.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>His share of the present play presents many such cases.</p>
<p>III. 3, seems also by Massinger.</p>
<p>III. 4, is by Fletcher. On page 263 there is an unmistakable
reminiscence of <emphasis>Henry VIII</emphasis>., Wolsey's "Farewell."</p>
<p>III. 5 (also marked 4), is by Massinger. On page 264 occurs, "At no
part," one of the commonest Massingerisms; and a little lower down,—</p>
<p>                   Ever maintained</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The freedom I was born to.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Compare <emphasis>Great Duke of Florence</emphasis>, I. 1-4,—</p>
<p>    For I must use the freedom I was born with.</p>
<p>It also occurs in other Massinger plays.</p>
<p>III. 6, is by Fletcher.</p>
<p>IV. 1, is by Fletcher.</p>
<p>IV. 2, is by Fletcher.</p>
<p>IV. 3, is by Fletcher. Here occurs another allusion to <emphasis>Henry VIII</emphasis>.,—</p>
<p>                   And glide away</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like a spent exhalation.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Compare <emphasis>Henry VIII</emphasis>., III. 2, 226:—</p>
<p>                               shall fall</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Like a bright exhalation in the evening.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Fletcher does not repeat himself often, and these two exceptions are
important.</p>
<p>IV. 4, is apparently by Massinger, but contains no repetitions.</p>
<p>IV. 5, is by Massinger. There are no clear Massingerisms, but the
metrical style, and the allusion to Raleigh already mentioned, make it
plain that the Scene is his.</p>
<p>V. 1, is also Massinger's. The end of this Scene I have not seen, as
pages 296-305 were missing in the proof-sheets I examined. Nearly all
Scene 2 is also missing. It and the rest of the play seem to be
Fletcher's, who, as usual, spoiled Massinger's fine conception of
Barnavelt, and makes him whine like Buckingham in <emphasis>Henry VIII</emphasis>. This
moral collapse of all energy in the face of death in the two characters
is significant. Massinger would have carried out the scene in quite
another tone. Some of the Fletcher scenes in this play, in which he has
an unusually large share, are surprisingly good, and remind us of
Fletcher at his best, in <emphasis>Philaster</emphasis> and the earlier plays. He fails
here, as he always does, in the delineation of character. Nowhere is
this break-down more characteristic than in Buckingham and Barnavelt. It
gives the end of our play quite a wrench, and deprives Barnavelt of the
sympathies which we had been forced to turn on him through his intrepid
behaviour in the great trial scene. We had almost gained the conviction
that his aims were really pure, and here we are called on to witness his
utter collapse, in which he almost whines for pardon for his sins, and,
like all worthless fellows without character seems actually to soften in
gratitude to the man who sent him to his death.</p>
<p>This conclusion, I say, weakens the dramatic power of the close, but it
does not prevent Sir John Barnavelt from occupying a high place among
our dramatic treasures.      R. BOYLE.</p>

<p>[12] Halliwell quotes Minsheu: "The Spanish <emphasis>borachoe</emphasis>, or bottle

<p>[47] The reading of the MS. is "snapsance," which is clearly wrong.
"Snaphance was the name for the spring-lock of a musket, and then for
the musket itself. It is said that the term was derived from the Dutch
<emphasis>snap-haans</emphasis> (poultry stealers), a set of marauders who made use of it"
(<emphasis>Lilly's Dramatic Works</emphasis>, ed. Fairholt, II., 272). "Tarrier" must mean
"a person that causes delay": cf. a passage from Sir Thomas Overbury's
character of "a meene Petty fogger":—"He cannot erre before judgment,
and then you see it, only <emphasis>writs of error</emphasis> are the <emphasis>tariers</emphasis> that keepe

already in the ground, the rope, the arrowes, the Archers all in a
readines, and heere I am come for him." (Anthony Copley's <emphasis>Wits, Fits,
and Fancies</emphasis>, 1614, p. 120.) Here is another merry tale, with rather
more point in it, from the same collection:—"A fellow being to suffer,
a maide came to the gallowes to beg him for her husband, according as
the custome of <emphasis>Spaine</emphasis> dispenceth in that case. The people seeing this
said unto the fellow: Now praise God that he hath thus mercifullie
preserv'd thee, and see thou ever make much of this kinde woman that so
friendly saves thy life. With that the Fellow viewing her and seeing a
great skarre in her face, which did greatlie disfigure her, a long nose,
thin lips and of a sowre complexion, hee said unto the Hangman: On (my
good friend) doe thy duty: Ile none of her." (p. 160.)</p>
<p>[49] Cf. <emphasis>Rom. and Jul</emphasis>., I., iii., 76, "Why, he's a man of wax," where
Dr. Ingleby (who has no doubt learnt better by this time) once took the
meaning to be, "a man of puberty, a proper man." Steevens happily
compared Horace's "<emphasis>cerea</emphasis> Telephi brachia."</p>
<p>[50] The old spelling for "bawbles."</p>
<p>[51] "Slug. A ship which sails badly." Halliwell. I cannot recall
another instance of the use of the word in this sense.</p>
<p>[52] The "trundle-bed" (or "truckle-bed") was a low bed moving on
castors. In the day-time it was placed under the principal or "high"
bed: at night it was drawn out to the foot of the larger bed. Vid.
Nares, sub "truckle bed" and "trundle bed."</p>
<p>[53] The reading of the MS. is unintelligible. For <emphasis>All</emphasis>. I would read
<emphasis>Alq</emphasis>., and for "Law you?"—by a very slight change—"Love you?" (the
question being addressed to Henrico). Then what follows is intelligible.</p>
<p>[54] "Flay" is usually, if not always, written "flea" in old authors.</p>

    I to the daughter, thou to the mother."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[57] We ought, no doubt, to read "professed,"—a trisyllable.</p>
<p>[58] An allusion is intended to the tailor's "hell,"—the hole under the
counter.</p>
<p>[59] <emphasis>Vide</emphasis> note on Vol. I., p. 175.</p>
<p>[60] MS. tracning.</p>
<p>[61] In the MS. the stage direction has been altered to "Enter Sir
Gefferie &amp; Bunche." The whole of the colloquy between Sucket and Crackby
is marked as if to be omitted. Doubtless this was one of the
"reformacons" made at the instance of the Master of the Revels.</p>
<p>[62] Such would seem to be the reading of the MS., but it is not
quite plain. I suspect that the true reading is "tripe-wives" (cf.
oysterwives, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>[63] I.e., Besár las manos (hand-kissing).</p>
<p>[64] MS. "will."</p>
<p>[65] Perhaps we should rather read:—</p>
<p>    "Fie, Sister;</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

     'Tis a pretty gent[leman], I know you love him."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[66] The words "I faith" have been crossed out in the MS.—as being
irreverent.</p>
<p>[67] MS. "whom."</p>
<p>[68] Cf. <emphasis>The Ladies Privilege</emphasis>, i. 1. (Glapthorne's Works, ii. 99)—</p>

<empty-line/>
<p>[69] In the MS. the word "witnes" has been crossed out and "vouchers"
substituted.</p>
<p>[70] The introductory part of this scene, up to the entrance of the
steward, had been omitted by the copyist and is added on the last leaf
of the play.</p>
<p>[71] In the margin we find the words "Well said, Mr. Steward: a good
observation."</p>
<p>[72] "Pride" has been crossed out in the MS.</p>
<p>[73] "What? does he plucke it out of his Codpeece? Yes, here lyes all
his affeccon."—Marginal note in MS.</p>
<p>[74] "A verrie politique drunkard"—"I think the barrell of Hedlebergs
in his bellye."—Marginal notes in MS.</p>
<p>[75] "Tis well his friends here to reconcile … … for assault and
battery elce."—the other words in the marginal note are illegible.</p>
<p>[76] "It were but cast away on such a beast as thou art." Marginal note.</p>
<p>[77] To "take in" is a common phrase for "to take by storm."</p>
<p>[78] Pappenheim fell at the battle of <emphasis>Lützen</emphasis>, November 16, 1632; but
there had been fighting at <emphasis>Maestricht</emphasis> in the earlier part of the year.</p>
<p>[79] MS. pdue.</p>
<p>[80] The first reading was—"Hold, hold, good Captaine, tis our most
temperate Steward."</p>
<p>[81] 'Heere, here' is a correction (in the MS.) for 'what then?'</p>
<p>[82] MS. Trime.</p>
<p>[83] These words are crossed out in the MS.</p>
<p>[84] Therefore this play would seem to have been acted at the
Whitefriars, i.e. at the Salisbury Court theatre. (F.G. Fleay.)</p>
<p>[85] The "jig" seems to have been a comic after-piece consisting of
music and dancing. In Mr. Collier's <emphasis>Hist. of Dram. Lit</emphasis>., iii. 180-85
(new ed.), the reader will find much curious information on the point.
The following passage from Shirley's <emphasis>Love in a Maze</emphasis> (1632) is not
noticed by Mr. Collier:—</p>
<p>                             "Many gentlemen</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Are not, as in the days of understanding,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<p>[86] MS. him.</p>
<p>[87] The name of the musician, I suppose; but the reading of the MS. is
somewhat illegible.</p>
<p>[88] The passage at first ran as follows: "Umh, how long have I slept,
or am I buried and walke in Elizium as the poets faine? Goe to, where
are they? in the ayre? I can percieve nothing nor remember anything has
been don or said!"</p>
<p>[89] '<emphasis>Grimes</emphasis>. Soe, now retire a little. Ile play him one fitt of
mirthe on my trebble to rouse him. <emphasis>Ext</emphasis>.' These words occur in the
left-hand margin. Probably they should stand here in the text 'Ext.' may
mean either '<emphasis>exeunt</emphasis>' (musicians) or '<emphasis>exit</emphasis>' (<emphasis>Grimes</emphasis> to disguise
himself).</p>
<p>[90] 'Who are these! ha! the towne waits? why, how now, my masters, whats
the matter, ha?'—Passage cancelled in MS.</p>
<p>[91] 'Bakside' is a correction (in the MS.) for 'buttock.'</p>
<p>[92] "Here Gent[lemen], share this amongst yee and pray for Grimes."
These words (addressed to the musicians) follow in the MS. but have been
scored through.</p>
<p>[93] The MS. gives "aurescion."</p>
<p>[94] The reading of the MS. seems to be "inuolute." Mr. Fleay suggests
"invocate."</p>
<p>[95] The repetition of 'loath' in the next line is suspicious.</p>
<p>[96] The arrangement of the verse is not easy: perhaps we should read—</p>
<p>    'Wishes for husband.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                  A proper Gent[leman]; Ime happy</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

     She has made so iuditious an election.'</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Our author usually makes a trisyllable of "gentleman"; here it counts
only as a monosyllable.</p>
<p>[97] Between this word and the next there is a mark of omission in the
MS., and the words "t'were Sir" have been written above.</p>
<p>[98] What follows, to the entrance of <emphasis>Thurston</emphasis>, is marked to be
omitted. I have thought fit to restore it to the text. "Here's Mr.
<emphasis>Thurston,"</emphasis> concludes Clariana's speech.</p>
<p>[99] Cf. a similar passage in Glapthorne's <emphasis>Wit in a Constable</emphasis>
(Works, I. 182):—</p>
<p>                                "a limber fellow,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

<p>

    And spend ten groats in cakes and Christian ale."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>From Shirley we learn that the apprentices took their pleasure
in the mild form of treating their sweethearts to cream and
prunes:—</p>
<p>    "You have some festivals, I confess, but when</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    They happen, you run wild to the next village,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Conspire a knot and club your groats apiece</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    For cream and prunes, not daring to be drunk."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                              (<emphasis>Honoria and Mammon</emphasis>, v. i.).</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Pimlico seems to have been a place near Hoxton famous for its ales and
custards; cf. Mayne's <emphasis>City Match</emphasis>, II. 6.—</p>
<p>    "Nay, captain, we have brought you</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    A gentleman of valour, who has been</p>

    In Moorfields often: marry it has been</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    To squire his sisters and demolish custards</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    At Pimlico."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>There is an unique tract entitled "Pimlyco or Runne Red cap, 'tis a mad
world at Hoggesden," 1609.</p>
<p>[100] I cannot find that "bob" is used as a technical term in falconry.
Mr. Fleay suggests that a "bob'd hawke" merely means a "hawk cheated
of her prey." I rather think the meaning is a "hawk beaten or repulsed
by her prey."</p>
<p>[101] From "A Kalendar of the English Church," p. 45 (Rivingtons: n.d.,
but 1865), one learns that "Marriage is restrained by Law at the
following times unless with a License or Dispensation from the Bishop
of the Diocese, his Chancellor, or Commissary, viz., from Advent Sunday
until eight days after the Epiphany; from Septuagesima until eight days
after Easter; and from the Monday in Rogation week until Trinity
Sunday."</p>
<p>[102] I venture to insert the word "poet": both sense and metre are
defective without it.</p>
<p>[103] In the MS. "thee" is corrected into "you."</p>
<p>[104] Some words have been cut away.</p>
<p>[105] MS. throng.</p>
<p>[106] "<emphasis>Thu</emphasis>. And here she comes, I feare me"—crossed out in the MS.</p>
<p>[107] Here a line follows in the MS:—</p>
<p>    "And verely she is much to blame in it."</p>
<p>It is crossed through, and rightly.</p>
<p>[108] "Puny" is not uncommonly spelt "puisne" (Fr. puisné) in old
authors.</p>
<p>[109] The metre requires "unman[ner]ly."</p>
<p>[110] MS. have.</p>
<p>[111] MS. puisants.</p>
<p>[112] The "Artillery Garden" was situated in Finsbury Fields, where also
was the place of exercise for the City Trained Bands. In the
"Antiquarian Repertory" (ed. 1807), i. 251-270, the reader will find an
interesting account of the Trained Bands and the Artillery Company. Old
writers are fond of sneering at the City warriors. The following passage
is from Shirley's "Witty Fair One," v. 1:—"There's a spruce captain
newly crept out of a gentleman-usher and shuffled into a buff jerkin
with gold lace, that never saw service beyond Finsbury or the
Artillery-Garden, marches wearing a desperate feather in his lady's
beaver, while a poor soldier, bred up in the school of war all his life,
yet never commenced any degree of commander, wants a piece of brass to
discharge a wheaten bullet to his belly."</p>

<p>[114] "Mooncalf" (originally the name for an imperfectly formed foetus)
was used as a term of reproach, like dodypol, nincompoop, ninny,
dunderhead, &amp;c.</p>

<p>[119] "Mew" is a falconer's term for the place where a hawk is confined.</p>
<p>[120] This passage is repeated in <emphasis>The Ladies Privilege</emphasis>, at the end of
Act I.</p>
<p>[121] "Curst" is an epithet applied to shrewish women and vicious
beasts.</p>
<p>[122] This is the prettiest passage, I think, to be found in Glapthorne.</p>
<p>[123] MS. me.</p>
<p>[124] "Oh me" is crossed out, and "once" written above.</p>
<p>[125] The passage is bracketed in the MS., and was probably meant to be

expected to escape official censure.</p>

<p>[131] Bracketed in MS.</p>
<p>[132] Early Greek writers held up the Scythians as models of justice and
simplicity (Iliad, xiii. 6, &amp;c.). Clearchus (apud Athen., xii. 27)
accuses them of cruelty, voluptuous living, and viciousness of every
kind; but, in justice to the Scythians, it should be added that in his
"animadversiones" to the "Deipnosophists" (when will somebody complete
and print Dyce's translation?) the learned Schweighaeuser in no measured
language accuses Clearchus of wanton recklessness and gross inaccuracy.</p>
<p>[133] "What is the matter there? looke to the prisoners," was the first
reading.</p>
<p>[134] The passage is bracketed in the MS.</p>
<p>[135] Erased in MS.</p>
<p>[136] Before correction the passage stood "And now, madam, being your
servant and <emphasis>Timothy</emphasis> I bring you newes!" The words "Stay, stay Mr.
Justice," &amp;c., were inserted afterwards.</p>
<p>[137] Bracketed in MS.</p>
<p>[138] The reading of the MS. appears to be "a lonly."</p>
<p>[139] Bracketed in MS.</p>
<p>[140] The MS. is a folio of thirty-one leaves, written in a small clear
hand: it was purchased for the National Library in 1851 from the Earl of
Denbigh.</p>
<p>[141] In May, 1622, "by reason of sickness and indisposition of body
wherewith it had pleased God to visit him, he had become incapable of
fulfilling the duties and was compelled to resign."—Vid. Collier's
"Hist. Eng. Dram. Lit." I. 402 (new ed.).</p>
<p>[142] Mr. Warner, of the Manuscript Department of the British Museum, to
whom we owe the excellent Catalogue of the Dulwich Collection, kindly
drew my attention to the autograph letter.</p>
<p>[143] In the right-hand margin we find "Jo: R: migh."—the names of the
actors who took the Captains' parts. Further on the name "Jo: Rice"
occurs in full. John Rice stands last on the list of Chief Actors in the
first fol. Shakespeare. The reader will find an account of him in
Collier's "Hist. of Eng. Dram. Lit.," iii. 486-88. It is curious that he
should have taken so unimportant a part; but perhaps he sustained one of
the chief characters besides.—"Migh" = Michael.</p>
<p>[144] It seems to have been no uncommon thing for officers to keep the
names of soldiers on the list after their death and pocket their pay:
cf. Webster's "Appius and Virginia," v. i., &amp;c.</p>
<p>[145] The reply of 1 <emphasis>Cap</emphasis>., extending to thirteen lines, has been
scored through in the MS., at the instance, I suppose, of the censorious
Master of the Revels; it is, unfortunately, quite illegible.</p>
<p>[146] The MS. reads "<emphasis>Enter Barnavelt, Modes-bargen, Leidenberck</emphasis>,
Vandermetten, <emphasis>Grotius</emphasis>, Taurinus, Utenbogart, <emphasis>Hogebeets</emphasis>." Names not
in italics are scored through.</p>
<p>[147] MS. Tau. <emphasis>Hog</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[148] All the characters remain on the stage in spite of this direction.</p>
<p>[149] At first the line ran, "Of this proud <emphasis>Prince of Orange</emphasis>, at the
worst."</p>
<p>[150] MS. <emphasis>Enter Pr. of Orange, Gr: Henrie, Gra: William, Collonells &amp;
Captaines. Gr: Henrie</emphasis> and <emphasis>Collonells</emphasis> are scored through. In the
right-hand margin is written the name of an actor, <emphasis>Mr. Rob:</emphasis></p>
<p>[151] The words "I feele too" probably belong to another speaker.</p>
<p>[152] Fletcher is fond of using "ye" for "you."</p>
<p>[153] In the MS. there is a marginal note:—"I like not this: neither do
I think that the pr. was thus disgracefully used, besides he is to much
presented. G.B." The initials are those of Sir George Buc, Master of the
Revels.</p>
<p>[154] "Shellain" is a corrupted form of Dutch <emphasis>schelm</emphasis>—a rogue,
villain.</p>
<p>[155] The stage direction in the MS. runs thus:—"<emphasis>Enter 1 Burger,
Vandermitten, Grotius." Vandermitten</emphasis> finally takes the place of
1 <emphasis>Burger</emphasis> and <emphasis>Grotius</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[156] Beneath, in the MS., is written the name of the actor who took the
part, "Mr. Gough."</p>
<p>[157] In the right-hand margin are written the initials "R.T." It is
unknown what actor was the owner of them.</p>
<p>[158] "Jo: Ri:" is written above, and "migh" in the right-hand margin.</p>
<p>[159] "Mr. Rob." took the Captain's part.</p>
<p>[160] This Captain is identical with the one in the previous scene:
"Jo: Rice:" took the part.</p>
<p>[161] In the MS. <emphasis>Vandermitten</emphasis> is scored through, and <emphasis>Grotius</emphasis> written
above; but the alteration is not followed afterwards.</p>
<p>[162] "R.T." was responsible for the part.</p>
<p>[163] In the right-hand margin are the initials "T.P.," i.e. Thomas
Pollard.</p>
<p>[164] In the right hand margin is a stage-direction, scored through,—
"Droms—Enter ye Arminians: pass over."</p>
<p>[165] MS. <emphasis>Enter Bredero, Vandort</emphasis> and 2 Lords. The words in Roman
letters are scored through in the MS.</p>
<p>[166] The brackets are mine: whoever excluded the 2 <emphasis>Lords</emphasis> left these
words standing by an oversight.</p>
<p>[167] These weak endings without a pause are characteristic of
Massinger.</p>
<p>[168] Massinger is fond of the use of parentheses.</p>
<p>[169] In the MS. <emphasis>Leiden</emphasis> has been corrected into <emphasis>Roterdam</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[170] The officer was personated by "R.T."</p>
<p>[171] In the right-hand margin we find "Mr. Rice."</p>
<p>[172] The Captains' parts were taken by "Mr. Rob." and "Mighel."</p>
<p>[173] The Dutch word <emphasis>knol</emphasis> signifies both a turnip and a blockhead.</p>
<p>[174] i.e. explain to me. (A very common expression.)</p>
<p>[175] "Fry" has here the unusual sense of "buzz, hiss."</p>
<p>[176] In the right-hand margin we find "Cap. Jo: R."</p>
<p>[177] Underneath is written Migh. who took the part of 1 <emphasis>Huntsman</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[178] "And bycause some Hares by haunting the lowe watrie places do
become foule and mesled, such Hares doe never follow the hard ways nor
make such pathes to their formes, but use all their subtleties and
pollecies by the sides of the Ryvers, brookes and other waters."

<p>[179] "R.T." took the part.</p>

margin.</p>
<p>[182] MS. Potents.</p>
<p>[183] The part was taken by "G. Lowen."</p>
<p>[184] The Wife's part was taken by "Nich", who may possibly be (as Mr.
Fleay suggests) Nicholas Tooley; but I suspect that a younger actor than
Tooley would have been chosen for the part.</p>
<p>[185] "Jo: Rice" took the part.</p>
<p>[186] A corruption of Dutch <emphasis>kermis</emphasis> (the annual fair).</p>
<p>[187] An ironical expression (very common) of denial or astonishment.</p>
<p>[188] <emphasis>Sc</emphasis>. merrily (Dutch <emphasis>lustig</emphasis>), "Lustick, as the Dutchman says."
—<emphasis>All's Well</emphasis>, II. 3.</p>
<p>[189] A corruption of Dutch <emphasis>brui</emphasis>. The meaning is "A plague on his
Excellencie!"</p>
<p>[190] In the MS. follow two and a half lines, spoken by <emphasis>Vandort</emphasis>, and a
speech of <emphasis>Barnavelt's</emphasis>, twenty-four lines long. These were cancelled on
revision. I have succeeded in reading some of the lines; and perhaps
after a keener scrutiny the whole passage might become legible. But I
have no doubt that the lines were cancelled by the author himself
(Massinger?) in order to shorten the scene.</p>
<p>[191] Nearly forty lines of dialogue that follow are cancelled in the
MS., in order to shorten the scene.</p>
<p>[192] Not marked in MS.</p>
<p>[193] This passage is marked in pencil, as for omission, in the MS.</p>
<p>[194] The words "Upon my soule" are crossed through in the MS.</p>
<p>[195] This line and the eleven lines following are marked for omission
in the MS.</p>
<p>[196] The words "tooke that course That now is practisd on you" are
crossed through in the MS., and "cutt of his opposites" substituted in
the right-hand margin.</p>
<p>[197] In the MS. the words "you can apply this" are crossed through.</p>

lowest <emphasis>canis</emphasis>. (Cf. a well-known couplet of Propertius, lib. iv. el.

<p>[211] A term of contempt, like "poor John."</p>
<p>[212] To set up one's rest, meant, as has been abundantly shown by
Shakespearean commentators, to stand upon one's cards at <emphasis>primero</emphasis>; but
the word "pull" in this connexion is not at all easy to explain. The
general sense of the present passage is plain: "Is my life held in such
paltry esteem that slaves are allowed to gamble for it as for a stake at
cards?" We have nowhere a plain account of <emphasis>primero</emphasis>. When the "Compleat
Gamester" was published (in 1674) the game had been discontinued. The
variety of quotations given by Nares, under <emphasis>Primero</emphasis> and <emphasis>Rest</emphasis>, is
simply distracting. There are two passages (apud Nares) of Fletcher's
bearing on the present difficulty:—</p>
<p>    "My <emphasis>rest is up</emphasis>, wench, and I <emphasis>pull</emphasis> for that</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Will make me ever famous."    <emphasis>Woman's Prize</emphasis>, I. 2.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    "Faith, sir, my <emphasis>rest is up</emphasis>,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And what I now <emphasis>pull</emphasis> shall no more afflict me</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Than if I play'd at span-counter."    <emphasis>Monsieur Thomas</emphasis>, IV. 9.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>Dyce accepts Nares' suggestion that <emphasis>pull</emphasis> means to <emphasis>draw a card</emphasis>; but
if a player is standing on his cards, why should he want to draw a card?
There is an old expression, to "pull down a side," i.e. to ruin one's
partner (by bad play); and I am inclined to think that to "pull at a
rest" in <emphasis>primero</emphasis> meant to try to pull down (beat, go beyond) the
player who was standing on his cards. The first player might say, "My
rest is up"; the other players might either discard or say, "See it";
then the first player would either "revie" it (cover with a larger sum)
or throw up his cards. At length—for some limitation would have been
agreed upon—the challenger would play his cards, and the opponents
would "pull at his rest"—try to break down his hand. I am not at all
sure that this is the proper explanation; but <emphasis>pull</emphasis> in the text cannot
possibly mean <emphasis>draw a card</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[213] The body of Leydenberg was not exposed until two days after
Barneveld's execution.</p>
<p>[214] Charles I. was particularly anxious that these trained bands
should be made as efficient as possible, In the "Analytical Index to the
Series of Records known as the Remembrancia" (printed for the
Corporation of the City of London, 1878) there are several letters from
the Lords of the Council to the Lord Mayor on this subject (pp. 533-9).
The Directions sent round to the Lord Lieutenants (An. 1638) concerning
the Trained Bands of the several counties are given in Rushworth's
<emphasis>Historical Collections</emphasis>, Part 2, vol. i. p. 790.</p>
<p>[215] An allusion, of course, to Bardolph's famous definition of
"accommodated" (2 <emphasis>Henry IV</emphasis>., iii. 2).</p>
<p>[216] <emphasis>Fox</emphasis> was a cant term for a sword of English make. At Hounslow
Heath there was a sword-blade manufactory:—"Nov 30 (1639). Benjamin
Stone, blade maker, Hounslow Heath, to the Officers of the Ordnance.
Will always be ready to deliver 1,000 swords of all fashions every month
throughout the year, and will put in such security as the office shall
desire. Has now ready at the Tower and in his own house 2,000 swords to
deliver when the officers shall please."—Calendar of State Papers,
Domestic Series, 1639-40, p. 134.</p>
<p>[217] <emphasis>Ticktacks</emphasis> was a game somewhat similar to backgammon. It is
described in the <emphasis>Compleat Gamester</emphasis>, 1674.</p>
<p>[218] The Pacification of Berwick took place in June, 1639.</p>
<p>[219] Tobacco-pipefuls; but no doubt a pun was intended. For <emphasis>Bermudas</emphasis>
tobacco Nares quotes from <emphasis>Clitus's Whimz</emphasis>., p. 135, "Where being
furnished with tinder, match, and a portion of decayed <emphasis>Bermoodus</emphasis> they
smoke it most terribly."</p>
<p>[220] Our forefathers esteemed the March brewing; we the October.</p>
<p>[221] To "build a sconce" means, I suppose, to fix a candle in a
candle-stick.</p>
<p>[222] This speech of Sir Richard's is very much in Shirley's style:
cf. <emphasis>Lady of Pleasure</emphasis> (I. 1).</p>
<p>[223] Galley-foist was the name given to long many-oared barges,
particularly the Lord Mayor's barge of state. Foist is also a term for a
sharper; and gallifoist was intended to be pronounced here gullifoist.</p>
<p>[224] An account of the way to play <emphasis>Gleek</emphasis> is given in the <emphasis>Compleat
Gamester</emphasis>, 1674.</p>
<p>[225] Ambergrease was not uncommonly used for culinary purposes.</p>
<p>[226] Father-in-law is often used by old writers for step-father.
Perhaps "by a" is a correction for "to a."</p>
<p>[227] Title, mark of distinction (Hamlet, I. 4, &amp;c.).</p>
<p>[228] A head-covering worn by women. "A night-rail (for a woman) pignon,
pinon," Sherwood's Engl.-French Dict. 1650.</p>
<p>[229] To be "in the suds" was an expression for to be "in the dumps."</p>
<p>[230] Vid. Notes of the Commentators on <emphasis>Henry V</emphasis>., iii. 7 ("strait
trossers").</p>
<p>[231] Regals were a kind of small portable organ: vide Nares.</p>
<p>[232] Cf. a passage in Shirley's <emphasis>Witty Fair One</emphasis> (IV. 2): "What makes
so many scholars then come from Oxford or Cambridge like market-women
with dorsers full of lamentable tragedies and ridiculous comedies which
they might here vent to the players, but they will take no money for
them?"</p>
<p>[233] The Theorbo was a kind of lute.</p>
<p>[234] On June 20, 1632, a royal proclamation was made "commanding the
Gentry to keep their Residence in at their Mansions in the Country, and
forbidding them to make their habitations in London and places
adjoining." The text of the proclamation is in Rushworth's Historical
Collections (1680), Pt. II. vol. i. p. 144. In a very interesting little
volume of unpublished poems, temp. Charles I. (MS. 15,228, British
Museum), there is an "Oade by occasion of his Maiesties Proclamatyon for
Gentlemen to goe into the Country." It is too long to quote here in
full, but I will give a few stanzas:—</p>
<p>    Nor lett the Gentry grudge to goe</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Into the places where they grew,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Butt thinke them blest they may doe so:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

                Who would pursue</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    The smoaky gloryes of the Towne,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That might goe till his Native Earth</p>

<p>

    And the more biteing Mercers bookes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Free from the bayte of oyled hands</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               And painted lookes?</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    The Country, too, eene chops for rayne:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    You that exhale it by your pow'r,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Let the fatt drops fall downe again</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               In a full show'r.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    And you, bright beautyes of the time,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    That spend your selves here in a blaze,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Fixe to your Orbe and proper Clime</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

               Your wandring Rayes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Lett no dark corner of the Land</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Bee unimbellisht with one Gemme,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And those which here too thick doe stand</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Sprinkle on them.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    And, trust mee, Ladyes, you will find</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    In that sweet life more sollid joyes,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    More true contentment to the minde,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Then all Towne-Toyes.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    Nor Cupid there less blood doth spill,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Butt heads his shafts with chaster love,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Not feath'red with a Sparrow's quill</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Butt of a Dove.</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>    There may you heare the Nightingale,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    The harmeless Syren of the wood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    How prettily shee tells a tale</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

              Of rape and blood.</p>
<empty-line/>

<empty-line/>
<p>[235] The Galliard, a lively French dance described in Sir John Davies'
<emphasis>Orchestra</emphasis> (st. 67).</p>
<p>[236] Sc. good-bye. Cf. Shirley's <emphasis>Constant Maid</emphasis>, i. 1, "Buoy, <emphasis>Close</emphasis>,
buoy, honest <emphasis>Close</emphasis>: we are blanks, blanks."</p>
<p>[237] Can the reference be to <emphasis>Troilus and Cressida</emphasis>?</p>
<p>[238] Ben Jonson's <emphasis>Alchemist</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[239] Puisne (i.e. puny) was the term applied to students at the Inns of
Court; also to Freshmen at Oxford.</p>
<p>[240] Cf. Shirley's <emphasis>Honoria and Mammon</emphasis>, i. 2:</p>
<p>    "Go to your Lindabrides</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    I'the new brothel; she's a handsome <emphasis>leveret</emphasis>."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[241] The first edition of this well-known book was published in 1628.
<emphasis>Parsons Resolutions</emphasis> is a fictitious book.</p>
<p>[242] The "lamentable ballad of the Lady's Fall" has been reprinted by
Ritson and Percy.</p>
<p>[243] In the MS. follows a line, scored through:—</p>
<p>    "And while my footman plaies sigh out my part."</p>
<p>[244] Shirley delights in ridiculing the affectation in which the
gallants of his time indulged. Cf. a very similar passage in <emphasis>The Lady
of Pleasure</emphasis>, v. 1.</p>
<p>[245] The cant language of thieves. In Harman's <emphasis>Caveat for Cursitors</emphasis>,
or some of Dekker's tracts, "Pedlars' French" may be found in abundance.</p>
<p>[246] I print this passage exactly as I find it in the MS. With a little
trouble it might be turned into good law.</p>
<p>[247] <emphasis>Aut Shirley aut Diabolus</emphasis>. Cf. <emphasis>Duke's Mistress</emphasis>, iv. 1:</p>
<p>    "You shall lead destiny in cords of silk,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    And it shall follow tame and to your pleasure."</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>[248] Sc. swaggering.</p>
<p>[249] A Chrisome child was one that died within a month after birth, at
the time of wearing the Chrisome cloth (i.e. the cloth formerly wrapt
round a child after baptism). Device implies that his rival is perfectly
helpless among ladies, a mere child.</p>
<p>[250] "In the City of London," says Nares, "young freemen who march at
the head of their proper companies on the lord mayor's day, sometimes
with flags, were called <emphasis>whifflers</emphasis> or <emphasis>bachelor whifflers</emphasis>, not because
they cleared the way but because they went first as whifflers did.—'I
look'd the next Lord Mayor's day to see you o' the livery, or one of the
<emphasis>bachelor</emphasis> whifflers. <emphasis>City Match</emphasis>.'"</p>
<p>[251] These words are scored through in the MS.</p>
<p>[252] To "bear a brain" means to have understanding. The expression is
very common.</p>
<p>[253] Not marked in the MS.</p>
<p>[254] The earliest reference I have yet found to the "Cup at
<emphasis>Newmarket</emphasis>" is in Shirley's <emphasis>Hyde Park</emphasis>, v. 1.</p>
<p>[255] The exact date of his death is unknown; he was dead before the
performance of Ben Jonson's <emphasis>Bartholomew Fair</emphasis> (1614).</p>
<p>[256] "Merlin. The <emphasis>falco aesalon</emphasis> of Linnaeus, a small species of hawk;
sometimes corrupted into murleon. It was chiefly used to fly at small
birds, and Latham says it was particularly appropriated to the service
of ladies."—Nares.</p>
<p>[257] Thomas Heywood gives an account of the "great ship" in his "True
description of his Majesties Royall Ship built this yeare 1637 at
Wool-witch in Kent," &amp;c. 1637. 4to.</p>
<p>[258] "Back side" = back yard.</p>
<p>[259] A wild cat.</p>
<p>[260] This scene was added, as an afterthought, at the end of the MS. In
the body of the MS. we find only "<emphasis>A song ith taverne. Enter Thomas</emphasis>."</p>
<p>[261] The stage direction is my own.</p>
<p>[262] All that I know at present of Mr. Adson is that he published in
1621 a collection of "Courtly Masquing Ayres."</p>
<p>[263] A corruption of "<emphasis>save-reverence</emphasis>": we usually find the form
"sir-reverence."</p>
<p>[264] i.e. drunk.</p>
<p>[265] An allusion to Webster's "<emphasis>Vittoria Coromborea, or the White
Devil</emphasis>."</p>
<p>[266] Not marked in MS. We have, instead, a note:—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>"And then begin as was intended."</emphasis></p>
<p>[267] Old authors constantly allude to the riotous conduct of the
'prentices on Shrove Tuesday.</p>
<p>[268] This is a correction (in the MS.) for "to a Beggars tune."</p>
<p>[269] So in Dekker &amp; Middleton's <emphasis>First Part of the Honest Whore</emphasis>
(IV. 3):—</p>
<p>    "<emphasis>A sister's thread</emphasis> i' faith had been enough."</p>
<p>Dyce was no doubt right in thinking that the expression is a corruption
of <emphasis>sewster's</emphasis> thread. In Ford's <emphasis>Lady's Trial</emphasis>, Gifford altered
"sister's thread" to "<emphasis>silver</emphasis> thread." Shirley has "sister's thread" in
<emphasis>Hyde Park</emphasis> (V. 1).</p>
<p>[270] With this abuse cf. a very similar passage in Shirley's <emphasis>Duke's
Mistress</emphasis> (IV. 1).</p>
<p>[271] The <emphasis>Woman Hater</emphasis> in Beaumont and Fletcher's play.</p>
<p>[272] "Canaries" was the name of a quick, lively dance. Cf. Middlemen's
<emphasis>Spanish Gipsy</emphasis> (IV. 2): "Fortune's a scurvy whore if she makes not my
head sound like a rattle and my heels dance the canaries."</p>
<p>[273] Cf. a similar passage in Shirley's <emphasis>Brothers</emphasis> (iii. 1).</p>
<p>[274] In Sidney's <emphasis>Arcadia</emphasis>.</p>
<p>[275] Cf. Jonson's <emphasis>Every Man out of his Humour</emphasis>, II. 1: "They say
there's a new motion of the city of <emphasis>Niniveh</emphasis> with <emphasis>Jonas</emphasis> and the whale
to be seen at <emphasis>Fleet bridge</emphasis>." (A <emphasis>motion</emphasis>, of course, is a puppet-show.)</p>
<p>[276] This line occurs, word for word, in Shirley's <emphasis>Bird in a Cage</emphasis>
(IV. 1):—</p>
<p>    … "A bird to be made much on. She and the horse
    <emphasis>That snorts at Spain by an instinct of nature</emphasis>
    Should have shown tricks together."</p>
<p>[277] An allusion to the game of "barley-break."</p>
<p>[278] In the MS. the speaker's name is omitted. I have chosen
<emphasis>Courtwell</emphasis> at a venture.</p>
<p>[279] <emphasis>Holland's Leaguer</emphasis> was the name of a notorious brothel in
Southwark.</p>
<p>[280] <emphasis>The Tell-Tale</emphasis>. Through the courtesy of the Master, Dr. Carver, I
have had an opportunity of examining this play. It is of no particular
interest. The comic part is very poor, suggesting William Rowley at his
worst. Here are some fair lines, the best I can find:—</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Fide[lio]</emphasis>. How? dead in prison?</p>
<p>    <emphasis>Duke</emphasis>. Dead, <emphasis>Fidelio</emphasis>:</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Things of theire nature, like [a] vipers brood,</p>
<empty-line/>
<p>

    Kill their owne parents. But having sett the Court</p>

<p>[281] A few years ago I suggested in "Notes and Queries" that this
unknown author was Cyril Tourneur. Afterwards I discovered that I had
been anticipated by Thomas Lovell Beddoes. Curiously enough Mr. Fleay
had independently arrived at the same conclusion. Mr. Swinburne (<emphasis>Essay
on Chapman</emphasis>) is inclined to attribute the <emphasis>Second Maiden's Tragedy</emphasis> to
Middleton.</p>

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.</p>
<p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.</p>
<p>
1.F.</p>
<p>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
<p>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>
<p>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>
<p>

including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.</p>
<p>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>
<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
<p>
Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
<p>
The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
<p>
Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>
<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>
<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>
<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.</p>
<p>
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>
<p>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>
<p>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a l:href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.</p>
<p>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
